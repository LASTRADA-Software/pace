"""In-process cache benchmark: pace-kv's storage stack vs jitbit/FastCache.

The rest of ``bench/`` measures the *daemon* — a TCP round trip per operation,
where a single request costs microseconds and the network dominates. That is the
right comparison against memcached and redis, and the wrong one against an
in-process cache library: a dictionary in your own address space has no network
to pay for, so the two differ by roughly three orders of magnitude for reasons
that say nothing about either implementation.

This script measures the one layer where the comparison is meaningful — the
in-process cache map — by running both sides on the same machine:

* ``pace-bench``, a Catch2 benchmark over our storage stack, decomposed so
  each production concern (byte budget, sharding, the CacheEngine facade) shows
  up as its own row;
* jitbit/FastCache's own BenchmarkDotNet suite, unmodified, cloned and run
  locally rather than quoted from its README (whose numbers are from unknown
  hardware and so cannot be divided into ours).

Both sides' benchmark bodies issue ``LOOKUPS_PER_ITERATION`` lookups, so both
means are divided by it to reach nanoseconds per single operation.

A third tier follows the head-to-head: read throughput across thread counts.
Nothing in a single-threaded ns/op figure describes it, and it is the axis a
sharded cache is actually built to win, so it is collected and reported here
rather than being left as console output nobody reads.

Typical use::

    python bench/inproc_bench.py                  # build, run everything, compare
    python bench/inproc_bench.py --no-jitbit      # ours only (no .NET SDK needed)
    python bench/inproc_bench.py --no-scaling     # skip the thread-scaling tier
    python bench/inproc_bench.py --no-build --samples 200

Requires a working CMake toolchain, as the rest of the suite does. The jitbit
half additionally needs ``git`` and a .NET 10 SDK on PATH; without them the
script reports the baseline as unavailable and still emits our numbers, the same
way ``--vs`` degrades when a real server binary is missing.

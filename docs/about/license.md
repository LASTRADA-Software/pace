pace-kv re-implements the wire protocols defined by the
[memcached project](https://memcached.org/) (Brad Fitzpatrick et al.,
BSD-3-Clause) and the [Redis project](https://redis.io/) (Salvatore
Sanfilippo et al., dual-licensed under RSAL / SSPL).

The protocols themselves are the work of those projects; this codebase
is a compatible re-implementation that aims to interoperate with the
clients written against them. The wire formats, semantics, and command
sets follow the published specifications.

# Configuration

pace-kv takes its settings from a YAML file, from command-line flags, or
from both. `pace-kv --help` prints the complete, always-current flag list;
this page covers where the file lives, which source wins, and what happens when
a setting cannot be applied.

## Where the config file lives

You do not have to tell pace-kv where its configuration is. Started with no
`--config`, it reads the **first of these that exists and it can read** — which
is exactly where each installer puts it:

| Platform | Per-user | Machine-wide |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fastcached/fastcached.yaml`, then `~/.config/fastcached/fastcached.yaml` | `/etc/fastcached/fastcached.yaml` |
| macOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fastcached/fastcached.yaml`, then `~/.config/fastcached/fastcached.yaml` | `/opt/fastcached/etc/fastcached.yaml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\fastcached\fastcached.yaml` | `%ProgramData%\fastcached\fastcached.yaml` |

The per-user file wins, so you can shadow a machine-wide configuration without
touching it and without root.

**Which column applies depends on who you are.** The machine-wide file describes
the *system service* — its cache lives where only the service account can write
— so only a process that could be that service reads it: root, an elevated
administrator, or a Windows service logon (the service's own account, or
`LocalSystem`). Run pace-kv as yourself and the machine-wide
row is passed over entirely, whatever its permissions; you get your own config,
or the built-in defaults.

That is deliberate, and it is why `systemctl --user start pace-kv` works out
of the box on a host whose `/etc/fastcached/fastcached.yaml` points the system
daemon at `/var/lib/fastcached/cache`: your instance never sees that file, so it
never tries to open a directory it has no access to. Name it with `--config` if
you genuinely want it.

**then**, not *else*: setting `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` does not take `~/.config` out
of the search, it only puts another location ahead of it. The basedir
specification treats `~/.config` as what `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` *means* when unset,
so under a strict reading it would drop out entirely; pace-kv probes both, on
the grounds that a half-migrated setup is better served by finding the file than
by ignoring it. If you have moved your config and left the old copy behind, the
banner below is where you will notice.

The startup banner reports which file was chosen:

```
[INFO] pace-kv 0.0.1 starting; bind=127.0.0.1:6674 ... config=/etc/fastcached/fastcached.yaml ...
```

`config=<none>` there means no file was found and the built-in defaults are in
effect — which is a perfectly good way to run pace-kv.

!!! note "The compile worker has its own file, with its own name"

    `pace-node` reads `pace-node.yaml` from the same
    locations under its own name, by the same rule: named is strict, discovered
    is skipped when absent, unreadable or untrusted. Everything on this page
    about *where* applies to it unchanged.

    What differs is the mapping. Every key there is one flag of
    `pace-node --help`, spelled with underscores instead of dashes,
    and the file and the command line reach each setting through the same
    applier — so precedence is simply that the command line is applied second.
    The daemon's keys below are a *mapping* rather than a rule (`--storage` is
    `storage_path`), which is why they are listed out. The worker's are on
    [its own page](../tools/pace-node.md#running-it-as-a-service).

!!! note "Named files are strict, discovered ones are not"

    `--config=<path>` overrides the search entirely, and the file must exist —
    you asserted it was there, so a typo is an error rather than a silent
    fallback to different settings.

    A *default* location that does not exist, or that this account may not read,
    is skipped and the next one tried. That is what lets a per-user daemon start
    normally alongside a machine-wide config it has no access to. A default file
    that exists and *is* readable but does not parse is still a startup error:
    at that point it is plainly meant to be used.

!!! warning "A privileged daemon only obeys a config an administrator could have written"

    When pace-kv runs as `root` or `LocalSystem`, `storage_path:` decides
    where a fully privileged process creates directories and writes files. So a
    privileged run uses a *discovered* config only when its directory is one no
    ordinary account can add or replace a file in — owned by
    `Administrators`/`SYSTEM` (or `root`), and not writable by anyone else.

    This applies to **every** discovered location, per-user ones included. `$HOME`
    and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` are inputs an unprivileged account often controls, and
    `sudo -E pace-kv` would otherwise take root's configuration from a file
    that account wrote. An unprivileged run is offered only its own files, so
    there is nothing there to vouch for and no check is applied.

    It matters most on Windows, where `C:\ProgramData` lets every standard
    account create files in a new subdirectory. The installer creates
    `C:\ProgramData\fastcached` with an access list of its own, so a packaged
    install already satisfies this; a directory somebody else made first does
    not. When a config is skipped for this reason pace-kv says so — on stderr,
    and in the log once the daemon has one — with the exact command that repairs
    it:

    ```
    pace-kv: C:\ProgramData\fastcached\fastcached.yaml: ignored: C:\ProgramData\fastcached
    can be written by accounts other than the administrative ones, ...
    Secure it with `icacls "C:\ProgramData\fastcached" /setowner *S-1-5-32-544 /inheritance:r ...`,
    or name a config explicitly with --config.
    ```

    `--config=<path>` is never checked this way — you named that file, which is
    your call to make.

## What the file looks like

Every installed copy ships fully commented, with each setting shown at its
built-in default, so an untouched file behaves exactly like running pace-kv
with no flags. Uncomment only what you want to change:

```yaml
# bind: 127.0.0.1
# port: 6674
max_memory: 4g
storage_path: /var/lib/fastcached/cache
```

Every key is a command-line flag spelled with underscores, and it takes exactly
the value the flag does: `port: 0x50` is refused because `--port=0x50` is, and
`listen:` takes `host:port` like `--listen`. A flag that takes no value is `true` or
`false` in the file — `true` passes the flag, `false` passes nothing — and no other
word; `yes` and `on` are refused rather than guessed at. A key the daemon does not
know, or a key written twice, stops it at startup naming the key and the line, so
a typo is never a setting that silently fails to apply.

A release that changes the on-disk record layout refuses an older store at
startup rather than mis-reading it. It is not damaged, and it does not have to be
thrown away — see [Upgrading a store](../operations/upgrading-a-store.md).

Path-valued settings (`storage_path`, `tls_cert`, `tls_key`) understand `$VAR`
and `${VAR}` environment references in the file; write `$$` for a literal dollar.
On the command line your shell has already expanded them, so pace-kv does not
expand them again. A
reference to a variable that is not set is an error rather than an empty
string, so a typo fails loudly instead of quietly relocating the cache. Windows
`%VAR%` is *not* expanded — a bare `%` is valid in a path.

## Precedence

From strongest to weakest:

1. **Command-line flags** — `--port=7000` beats everything.
2. **The config file** — whether named with `--config` or discovered.
3. **Environment** — only `FASTCACHED_METRICS_PORT`, so a container's daemon
   and its `--healthcheck` probe can agree on a port with one `-e`.
4. **Built-in defaults.**

Because a flag outranks the file for as long as it is on the command line, a
service registered with a setting baked into its launch arguments will ignore
that key in the file forever. This is why `--install-service` registers only
what you typed, and why editing the config file is the way to change a running
installation.

## Reloading

`systemctl reload pace-kv` (or `SIGHUP` directly, or the service manager's
`PARAMCHANGE` on Windows) re-reads the file in place, without dropping
connections. Only part of the configuration is reloadable:

--8<-- "reload-matrix.md"

The right-hand column is live-wired at startup — listeners are bound and the
storage backend is constructed once — so a reload that changes any of it is
rejected *in full*, the previous configuration is kept, and the reason is
logged. A reload therefore either applies everything or nothing.

## Secrets

Keep `requirepass` in the config file, not on the command line: launch
arguments are world-readable through the process table and through the service
registration. `--install-service` refuses `--requirepass` outright for that
reason.

On **Linux and macOS**, give the file mode `0640` and make it readable by the
account the service runs as — which is what the macOS installer does to
`/opt/fastcached/etc/fastcached.yaml`.

On **Windows** the installer does it for you, and the directory and the file are
deliberately different. `C:\ProgramData\fastcached` is locked so that only
`SYSTEM` and `Administrators` can *write* it — which is what the daemon's own
trust check requires — while `Users` may still read it, the convention for
`%ProgramData%`. The **file** does not inherit that: seeding gives
`fastcached.yaml` an access list of its own, granting `SYSTEM` and
`Administrators` full control and `NT AUTHORITY\SERVICE` read, and nothing else.
The service reads it through that last entry.

Upgrading from a version that did not do this repairs the file, but only if it
is still readable by every local account — a narrower grant you added yourself is
left alone. Your edits are never touched either way. To check, or to repair a
file you have re-created by hand:

```powershell
icacls C:\ProgramData\fastcached\fastcached.yaml
icacls C:\ProgramData\fastcached\fastcached.yaml /inheritance:r `
       /grant *S-1-5-18:F /grant *S-1-5-32-544:F /grant *S-1-5-6:R
```

Raw SIDs rather than account names, because names are localised: `S-1-5-18` is
`SYSTEM`, `S-1-5-32-544` is `Administrators`, and `S-1-5-6` is
`NT AUTHORITY\SERVICE`. Dropping that last grant leaves a file the service cannot
read, and a daemon that cannot read its configuration starts on built-in defaults
rather than failing.

## Editing the installed file

=== "Linux"

    ```sh
    sudoedit /etc/fastcached/fastcached.yaml
    sudo systemctl reload pace-kv     # or restart, for the non-reloadable keys
    ```

    The file is a package config file (dpkg conffile / rpm
    `%config(noreplace)`), so your edits survive upgrades.

=== "macOS"

    ```sh
    sudo vi /opt/fastcached/etc/fastcached.yaml
    sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/software.lastrada.fastcached
    ```

    Only the `fastcached.yaml.default` beside it is package payload; the live
    file is seeded from it once, when absent, and never replaced.

=== "Windows"

    ```powershell
    notepad C:\ProgramData\fastcached\fastcached.yaml   # elevated
    sc.exe stop FastCached; sc.exe start FastCached
    ```

    The MSI installs a `fastcached.yaml.default` template under the install
    directory and seeds `%ProgramData%` from it only when nothing is there yet,
    so a later upgrade does not discard your edits. The live file is deliberately
    not part of the installer payload, and uninstalling leaves it behind.

## Per-user daemons

A personal cache needs no root and no packaged file at all — drop one in your
own config directory and pace-kv will find it:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/fastcached
cp /etc/fastcached/fastcached.yaml ~/.config/fastcached/fastcached.yaml
systemctl --user restart pace-kv
```

| Lists, hashes, sorted sets, scripting, `KEYS` / `SCAN` | Not supported (see [Unsupported Redis commands](../commands/redis/unsupported.md)) |

This is a deliberate subset chosen to cover the `sccache` /
key-value-cache use case. Expanding the Redis surface is tracked as a
separate effort and not included in the current scope.

## What "full" means here

For an item marked **Full**, pace-kv parses and honors the command
as the upstream spec describes — including the edge cases listed in
the per-command page. Where pace-kv's storage model differs from
upstream's (no slabs, single keyspace, no SASL backend), the affected
commands are marked **Synthetic**, **Stub**, **Rejected**, or
**Not supported** rather than **Full**.

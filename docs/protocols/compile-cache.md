# Compile cache (`0xFC`)

A small binary protocol for storing and retrieving compiler output, used by
[`pace-cc`](../tools/pace-cc.md). Unlike the memcached and Redis
protocols, which move opaque bytes, this one is **structured**: the server
understands that a value contains an object blob plus tagged text regions, and
rewrites the paths inside those regions.

## Detection

The first byte a client sends selects the protocol. `0xFC` selects the compile
cache, alongside the memcached and Redis flavors — see
[Autodetection](autodetect.md). There is no dedicated port and no flag to
enable it: every `pace-kv` listener serves it.

## Framing

All multi-byte integers are unsigned 32-bit big-endian. A *field* is a length
followed by that many bytes.

Every request carries a fixed 7-byte header and then exactly the payload it
declares:

| Offset | Size | Field | Meaning |
|--------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | 1 | magic | Always `0xFC`. |
| 1 | 1 | version | Protocol version. Current: **15**, and the oldest accepted is also **15** — see [Versioning](#versioning). |
| 2 | 1 | op | `0x01` STORE, `0x02` FETCH, `0x03` AUTH; the rest are [distributed execution](#distributed-execution) and [node identity](#node-identity-and-sealed-frames). |
| 3 | 4 | payloadLength | Bytes of payload following the header. |

Every reply carries a fixed 5-byte header and then exactly the payload it
declares — **uniformly for every status**, including a miss, which carries a
zero-length payload rather than no payload at all:

| Offset | Size | Field |
|--------|------|-------|
| 0 | 1 | status |
| 1 | 4 | payloadLength |

Those two declared lengths are what make the protocol extensible. A receiver
that does not recognise an opcode can skip exactly `payloadLength` bytes, answer
with a typed error, and stay in sync — so adding a verb is not a breaking change,
and a refusal is a *reply* rather than a dropped connection. Both sides frame
through one shared module, `src/Pace/Protocol/CompileCacheWire.hpp`, so the
daemon, the launcher, and the test client cannot disagree about the layout.

### Statuses

| Byte | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| `0x00` | Miss | FETCH found nothing. Payload empty. A legitimate negative, not an error. |
| `0x01` | Ok | Command succeeded; payload is the result, if any. |
| `0x02` | Error | Command refused; payload is `[u8 errorCode][message]`. |
| `0x03` | Progress | The server is still working on this request. Payload empty. **Not** an outcome: zero or more precede exactly one of the three above, and only on COMPILE and ADMIT. |
| `0x04` | Push | One frame of a subscription's stream. **Not** an outcome either, and only on SUBSCRIBE. |

Which statuses an op may be answered with is table data, not convention:

| Op | Legal statuses |
|----|----------------|
| STORE | Ok, Error |
| FETCH | Ok, Miss, Error |
| AUTH | Ok, Error |
| REGISTER | Ok, Error |
| HEARTBEAT | Ok, Error |
| LEASE | Ok, Error |
| RELEASE | Ok, Error |
| COMPILE | Ok, Progress, Error |
| ADMIT | Ok, Progress, Error |
| SETTLE | Ok, Error |
| MACHINE-BUDGET | Ok, Error |

A miss and a refusal being distinct is the point. When both were the byte `0x00`,
a client the daemon could not serve saw an endlessly cold cache and no
diagnostic — the build merely got slower, forever, with nothing to show for it.

### Error codes

| Byte | Name | Raised when |
|------|------|-------------|
| `0x01` | unsupported-version | The request version is outside the server's range. |
| `0x02` | unknown-opcode | The opcode is not one this build knows. |
| `0x03` | malformed-frame | The fields do not exactly fill the declared payload. |
| `0x04` | payload-too-large | The declared payload exceeds the session cap. |
| `0x05` | malformed-value | A STORE payload is not a compile value at all — it does not decode. Narrower than it looks: a value that decodes and names a generation this build does not implement is `foreign-value-generation`, not this. |
| `0x06` | *(reserved)* | Never sent. Was `canonicalization-failed`, for a failure `PathCanon` could not produce; removed in issues #59/#69. The number is burnt so it is never reused with a different meaning. |
| `0x07` | storage-write-failed | The cache engine refused the write. |
| `0x08` | unauthenticated | A credential is required and has not been accepted on this connection. |
| `0x09` | no-worker | No registered worker matches the requested toolchain. |
| `0x0a` | no-capacity | Every matching worker is at its slot limit, or its compile byte budget is held by the compiles running there (`limited-by: compile-budget`). |
| `0x0b` | already-in-flight | Another client is already compiling this key. |
| `0x0c` | dispatch-not-permitted | This listener does not serve distributed execution. |
| `0x0d` | unknown-lease | The lease token is unknown or has expired. |
| `0x0e` | fingerprint-mismatch | The worker does not serve the toolchain the job names. |
| `0x0f` | unsupported-codec | No codec in common with what the request offered. |
| `0x10` | worker-scratch-unavailable | The worker could not prepare a scratch directory, or could not write the translation unit into it. |
| `0x11` | worker-spawn-failed | The worker could not *start* the compiler. Not "the compiler rejected the code" — that is a successful exchange carrying a non-zero exit code. |
| `0x12` | not-leader | This node does not lead the cluster. The message carries the leader's endpoint when one is known, and is empty during an election. |
| `0x13` | not-a-member | The caller is not a member of this cluster, so it may not spend the fleet's capacity. It is still served the cache. |
| `0x14` | withdrawn | Matching workers have slots free on paper and have withdrawn them: their machines are busy with something other than this fleet, or out of scratch space. Distinct from `no-capacity`, which means the fleet is full of this build's own work. |
| `0x15` | no-cluster | This node runs no cluster, so there is nothing to administer. Distinct from `not-leader`, which names somewhere else to ask. |
| `0x16` | invalid-cluster-change | The cluster cannot accept that change — a setting nobody has heard of, a member named with no address, a field a verb ignores. The message says which. |
| `0x17` | endpoint-busy | This endpoint has reached its own concurrent-request cap or in-flight byte budget. A statement about one node's front door, never about the fleet. |
| `0x18` | malformed-registration | A REGISTER named its toolchain, its endpoint or its version in bytes that are not valid UTF-8. The message says which field. Refused rather than repaired: a fingerprint is matched byte for byte, so a worker admitted under a cleaned-up name would match nothing and never be picked. |
| `0x19` | lease-unauthorized | The lease token is not one this cluster issued: its signature does not verify under the key the worker's roster holds for the voter it names, that key has been revoked, or it is not a lease token at all. Deliberately one code for all of them — a receiver cannot tell a forgery from a random string, and a client's answer to a revoked signer is the same. Distinct from `unknown-lease`, which names a lease the scheduler *did* issue and has since forgotten. Nothing the token claimed is echoed back. |
| `0x1a` | lease-endpoint-mismatch | An authentic lease, presented to a worker it was not issued for. Only ever reported once the signature has verified, so it is a diagnostic rather than a hint: the message names both endpoints, because the common cause is a worker registered under an address clients do not dial, not a replay. |
| `0x1b` | lease-expired | An authentic lease, presented past its expiry and the clock-skew slack. Not a capacity statement — a worker's slots bound what it runs, the expiry bounds how long a *captured* token is worth replaying. |
| `0x1c` | worker-toolchain-survey-in-flight | The worker is still identifying its toolchains and serves nothing yet. Distinct from `fingerprint-mismatch`: that one says this worker serves a different toolchain, this one says the same request will succeed shortly. Reachable only by dialling the node directly — a node registers nothing until its survey finishes, so the scheduler never offers it to anyone who asked the fleet. |
| `0x1d` | request-deadline-exceeded | The request was admitted and outran the window this surface allows for answering it. Not `endpoint-busy`, which says the node is momentarily full and to come back: this one says the work was abandoned on time, and for a compile it is a question about the lease timeout rather than about the worker. Sent only when the server can still reach the client — a peer swept while the connection is parked on the socket gets the close alone. |
| `0x1e` | foreign-value-generation | A STORE whose value *is* a compile value, well formed, written under a canonicalization generation this build does not implement. Emphatically not `malformed-value`, which says the bytes are not a compile value at all: this one is the normal, expected answer to a peer of a *different* generation during a rolling upgrade, and reporting it as malformed tells an operator their cache is damaged when the fleet is merely mixed. Either direction — a producer behind this server answers it exactly as one ahead of it — so the message names both generations rather than a direction, and that is the whole diagnostic. |
| `0x1f` | cluster-change-in-flight | One membership change is already uncommitted, so this one must wait. The one **retriable** code in the cluster-administration range: the cluster could accept the change and will, shortly. Not `invalid-cluster-change`, which would send an operator to correct a record that is already correct. |
| `0x20` | cluster-change-not-needed | The change asked for is already in force, so nothing was recorded — `--cluster-admit` naming a member the cluster already has. Idempotence rather than a mistake, and a code rather than a success because no entry was appended and there is no index to name. |
| `0x21` | worker-compiler-unclassified | The worker ran the program its own `--toolchain` names and cannot tell what it is, so it cannot build a command line for it. Split from `worker-spawn-failed`, which says the program could not be run at all. |
| `0x22` | *(reserved)* | Never sent. Was `enrollment-closed`, the answer a closed enrollment window gave; since zero-config formation a joiner's request is always recorded and the approval is the gate. The number is burnt. |
| `0x23` | enrollment-full | The pending list is full, so the request was not recorded. A refusal rather than an eviction, so a flood cannot push the real joiner off the list the operator is reading. |
| `0x24` | *(reserved)* | Never sent. Was `enrollment-already-collected`, which made a key hand-over spendable once; an approved enrollment no longer carries a secret ([#178](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/178)). The number is burnt. |
| `0x25` | unknown-fleet-selector | A fleet read named a section or a range this build does not serve. The message lists the ones it does. |
| `0x26` | node-proof-unchallenged | A node proof arrived with no challenge outstanding on this connection — never asked for one, or already spent it. The exchange was got wrong, so ask for a challenge; not a statement about the key. |
| `0x27` | node-proof-rejected | A node proof's signature did not verify under the identity key it presented. One answer for every way that happens, since naming the field would be an oracle, and asked **before** the roster is consulted. |
| `0x28` | *(reserved)* | Never sent. Was `roster-expired`, named for the certified roster's lapse ([#178](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/178)); what it still meant is `grant-unverifiable`. The number is burnt. |
| `0x29` | node-key-unknown | A node proof verified, under a key this cluster does not hold for the id it named: a machine nobody admitted, or one presenting a key other than the one admitted under its id. The remedy is an admission, not a new key. |
| `0x2a` | node-key-revoked | A node proof verified under a key the cluster has **revoked** — the forgotten machine itself. The connection is kept and marked, and every later verb on it is refused as the forgotten machine's, from any address, this machine's included. |
| `0x2b` | node-identity-required | A verb only a machine that **proved** its identity may send — REGISTER, NODE-ANNOUNCE, HEARTBEAT, WITHDRAW — arrived on a connection that has not, loopback included. A machine ticket admits a client and never satisfies these: a ticketed connection is not sealed. |
| `0x2c` | enrollment-host-full | The request came from an address that already has as many enrollment requests waiting as one host may hold, counted by the address each request first came from, so it was not recorded. Its own code rather than enrollment-full, because one address asking a lot and many machines waiting are different problems; a joiner treats both as a wait. |
| `0x2d` | ticket-refused | An AUTH presenting a machine ticket this node did not accept: a signature that does not verify, a machine the roster does not hold, a revoked key, an audience that is not this node, or an expiry passed. One code for all of them. The message names the reason when the caller could have checked it itself -- malformed bytes, a wrong audience, an expiry -- or when it is the node's own state; a forgery, a machine the roster does not hold and a revoked key all read `not admitted by this node`, because AUTH answers any address and those three would tell a stranger which ids the roster holds. The node still counts each of them apart. Not `unauthenticated`, which says a credential is still owed; this one says a credential was presented and judged. |
| `0x2e` | identified-caller-required | An operator's **control** verb -- `CLUSTER-ADMIT` in every form, `CLUSTER-FORGET`, `CLUSTER-SET`, `ENROLL-CONTROL` -- from a caller admitted by `--fleet-open` alone. `--fleet-open` admits a caller to what the fleet serves and never to what decides the fleet; a caller on this machine, one that proved a node key, or one presenting a verified machine ticket is past this refusal, and is then asked for an operator's standing (`operator-standing-required`). Not `not-a-member`: the caller is admitted, and the remedy is to identify itself. |
| `0x2f` | not-shared-cache | A `SHARED-FETCH` or `SHARED-STORE` at a node that is not the fleet's shared cache right now: the `shared-cache` setting names another machine or none, or names this one and its tier could not be opened. Not `unknown-opcode`, since every node implements the verbs and a client told otherwise would conclude the build is too old; not `not-a-member`, which would tell a proven member it is not one. A `pace-kv` answers it too, so a client has one refusal to read as a miss whichever wrong machine it reached. |
| `0x30` | worker-rejected-argument | The worker will not pass one of the job's arguments to its compiler — it is not on the worker's per-driver-family allowlist, or a path-mapping value cannot be spelled into a rule — and the message names it; every refused argument of the job, not only the first, cut at the node condition detail's ceiling with the rest counted (`and N more`). The frame was well formed: until this code existed the refusal was answered `malformed-frame`, and a launcher reported a flag this fleet does not dispatch as a version skew. Either add the argument on the workers with `--allow-compile-arg`, if it runs no program and names no path, or leave those compiles to run locally. |
| `0x31` | grant-unverifiable | The worker can check nobody's lease right now: the state its own consensus applied names no voter yet, or no leader that state counts has spoken to it for longer than the silence bound. A statement about the worker, never about the lease — a fresh grant would get the same answer. |
| `0x32` | roster-not-yet-applied | A node proof the answering node cannot judge **yet**: its consensus has not applied the log it recovered when it started -- a lone voter before its election commits, a follower before its leader first speaks -- so the key roster it judges by may lack a key its cluster holds. Answered instead of `node-key-unknown`, which would tell an operator to admit a machine the cluster already holds. A statement about the answering node: the proving node asks again on a short backoff, and nobody needs to act. A launcher never meets it -- it proves no identity. |
| `0x33` | operator-standing-required | An operator's **control** verb -- `CLUSTER-ADMIT` in every form, `CLUSTER-FORGET`, `CLUSTER-SET`, `ENROLL-CONTROL` -- from a caller that IS identified, by a proven node key or a verified machine ticket, whose machine holds no **voter's** seat in the state the asked node applied. A ticket proves a fleet machine, never an operator: any process on an admitted laptop can have its node mint one. These verbs are answered to the asked node's own machine and to a voter's identity alone; run the verb on a voter, or promote this machine. A caller `--fleet-open` alone admitted is still told `identified-caller-required`. |

Every one of these is a **refusal the client answers by compiling locally**,
never by failing. They are distinct codes rather than one "no" because they mean
different things to an operator: `not-a-member` is a policy decision somebody
made, `no-worker` is a fingerprint nobody in the fleet serves, `no-capacity` is a
fleet that is too small, and `already-in-flight` is none of the three.

The byte values are wire contracts and are never reassigned, which is why the table is
not in the order the codes were added: a burnt number stays burnt, and a new code takes
the next free byte rather than the one beside its neighbour in meaning. The enumeration
and every code's full argument live in `CompileCacheWire.hpp`'s `ErrorCode`.

### STORE

```
[0xFC][ver][0x01][u32 len]  payload: [key][prefetchGroup][srcRoot][buildTree][value]
```

The `srcRoot` and `buildTree` fields describe the *producer's* layout. The
server uses them to rewrite absolute paths inside the value's text regions into
canonical tokens before storing — so what lands in the cache is layout-neutral.

### FETCH

```
[0xFC][ver][0x02][u32 len]  payload: [key]
```

On a hit the reply payload is the stored value, in its **canonical** form — the
client localizes it to its own layout.

### AUTH

```
[0xFC][ver][0x03][u32 len]  payload: [kind][username][secret]
```

`kind` is one byte naming the credential: `0x01` a password, `0x02` a machine
ticket, whose bytes are the `secret` and whose `username` must be empty. Any
other byte, or a ticket with a username, is a malformed frame.

An empty `username` asks to be verified against the secret alone — the redis
`requirepass` form, and the usual one. The field is always present so the frame
arity does not depend on which credential style a client uses.

`pace-kv` holds no roster and so can verify no machine: against
`--requirepass` a ticket is refused as a wrong credential would be, and with no
credential configured it is answered `Ok` and verifies nothing, like any other.

A compile node checks no password — the one it may hold, `--requirepass`, it only
presents to the `pace-kv` behind its `--upstream` — so it verifies a **ticket** and
nothing else: a password `AUTH` is answered `Ok` and establishes nothing, and the declared `kind`
decides what is verified — a genuine ticket's bytes under the password kind establish
nothing either. A ticket it accepts says which machine the connection speaks for; one it
refuses is `ticket-refused` and **clears** whatever an earlier `AUTH` on the connection
established, so the command pipelined behind it is judged as a stranger's — or, for a
revoked key, as the forgotten machine's, which no later `AUTH` lifts.

A ticket is its claims, then an Ed25519 signature over them by the machine's own
identity key, as two length-prefixed fields. The claims are a label, the machine id, the
**audience** — the one endpoint it may be presented to, as the presenter dialled it — a
big-endian `u64` expiry in Unix seconds, and a nonce, each length-prefixed. A node accepts
one only for an audience that is itself, within a minute of its minting and the clock-skew
slack, and once: it remembers every ticket it has spent until it could no longer be
accepted anyway.

### MINT-TICKET

```
[0xFC][ver][0x1e][u32 len]  payload: [audience]
```

Asks a compile node to mint a ticket, signed with its identity key, for `audience`. The
reply payload is the ticket, ready to be the `secret` of an `AUTH` of kind `0x02`.

Served **over loopback only**, judged from the connection's peer address: a ticket is this
machine vouching for its caller, so a caller on another machine is refused `not-a-member`
before anything is signed. An audience naming no one machine — loopback, a wildcard, no
host — is refused `malformed-frame`, since such a ticket would be spendable at any node
that heard it. A node that holds no identity key refuses it `no-cluster`.

### EXPLAIN-ADMISSION

```
[0xFC][ver][0x1b][u32 len]  payload: [subject]
reply:                               [verdict][u32 decidedBy][standing][subject]
```

Asks a node to fold its admission decision and report it. A non-empty `subject` is a
**machine**, named by its id or by its identity key: the answer is where it stands in the
roster this node holds and which routes a connection proving its key, or presenting its
ticket, would take. That question is about a third party, so it is gated like any member's
verb. An empty `subject` asks about **the connection asking**, and is answered even to a
caller the node refuses — it says only what that connection established.

`verdict` is one byte: `0x01` refused by no route, `0x02` admitted, `0x03` forgotten — a
revoked key, which outranks every route. `decidedBy` is every route that produced it,
OR-ed: `0x08` `--fleet-open`, `0x10` a proven key, `0x20` a revoked key, `0x40` loopback,
`0x80` a machine ticket; `0x01`, `0x02` and `0x04` are retired and never reused.
`standing` is one byte for a machine question — `0x01` voter, `0x02` learner, `0x03`
pending in the enrollment window, `0x04` revoked, `0x05` unknown — and an **empty** field
for the question about the connection. A reader refuses a verdict or a standing it cannot
name and keeps a route bit it cannot name, so a newer node's answer is never misreported as
a healthy one.

### FLEET-SUMMARY

```
[0xFC][ver][0x1f][u32 len]  payload: [nonce]
reply:                               [summary][publicKey][signature]
```

Asks a node which fleet it is in. A machine deciding whether to join a fleet asks a seed
before it is anybody's member, so the verb is **pre-auth**: nobody is refused at the door and
no credential is asked for. The request is one 32-byte `nonce` the asker chose, and its
ceiling is 64 bytes (`MaxFleetSummaryPayload`), the tightest on the table, since anybody who
can route to the port may send it.

The reply's `summary` is one nested field holding exactly the fields a discovery beacon
carries, byte for byte: the cluster id, the fleet's state (`0x01` solitary, only its founder
ever admitted; `0x02` established; `0x03` pending, on its way to another fleet), its creation
time as a big-endian `u64` of Unix seconds, the leader's id and `0xFC` endpoint, the speaker's
id and Raft endpoint, the member ids (at most `MaxFleetSummaryMembers`, ten, the cap a beacon
holds: since version 15 every carrier holds one cap), the member total, the speaker's own `0xFC` endpoint and the
leader's identity key. Under `0x03` the leader fields name the fleet the speaker **asked**,
never its own. An empty field states that the speaker knows none.

`publicKey` is the answering node's identity key and `signature` is its Ed25519 signature over
the label `fastcache-fleet-summary-v1`, the asker's nonce, the summary and the key, as
length-prefixed fields. A recorded answer replayed to a later asker names a nonce that asker
never chose, so it verifies for nobody else. The signature proves who **spoke**, not that the
fleet holds whom it names: a reader acts on the member list only beside a key it already holds.

A node that runs no consensus belongs to no fleet and answers `no-cluster`, and so does one
whose consensus address reaches only itself, since a peer told to dial it would dial itself. A
`pace-kv` answers `no-cluster` too: it is a cache and belongs to no fleet. A nonce that is
not one 32-byte field is `malformed-frame`. None of these refusals is counted, because anybody
can provoke them.

### SHARED-FETCH

```
[0xFC][ver][0x20][u32 len]  payload: [key]
```

`FETCH`'s payload and replies -- `Ok` carrying the stored value in its canonical form, `Miss`,
or an error -- and a reply as large as the artefact it carries, as `FETCH`'s is. A different
verb because a different policy: `FETCH` reads this machine's private tier and answers this
machine alone, while this reads the **fleet's** shared cache and answers any caller whose
connection proved a key the fleet holds or presented a ticket the node verifies. This
machine's own address and `--fleet-open` admit nobody here, and a revoked key is refused from
any address.

Served only on the machine the cluster's `shared-cache` setting names, and only while its
tier is open; every other node answers `not-shared-cache` (`0x2f`), and so does a `pace-kv`,
which is never the fleet's shared cache -- one refusal, read as a miss, whichever wrong machine
a client reached.

### SHARED-STORE

```
[0xFC][ver][0x21][u32 len]  payload: [key][prefetchGroup][srcRoot][buildTree][value]
```

`STORE`'s payload, canonicalized the same way, under `SHARED-FETCH`'s policy. The reply is `Ok`
or an error, bounded to 64 MiB (`MaxReportReply`) as `STORE`'s is. Both verbs are read under the
session's payload ceiling, like their twins, and are reachable only after the connection's
admission.

## Distributed execution

Five more verbs turn the same wire into a scheduler and a worker protocol. None
of them is served by `pace-kv`: the scheduler is a `pace-node` whose
mode serves it, and the worker is the same binary serving compiles, both answering on
its one `--listen-node`.

A scheduling verb arriving at a cache listener is answered `dispatch-not-permitted`
with a message naming where the scheduler went. It is a **reply**, not a dropped
connection, and it keeps its opcode rather than becoming unknown — a client built
against an older daemon has to learn *why* its scheduling stopped, and a close is
indistinguishable from a dead host while `unknown-opcode` would say this daemon is
too old when it is in fact too new.

`REGISTER` carries **one** fingerprint, so a worker serving several toolchains
registers once per toolchain. The scheduler keys a worker on
(fingerprint, endpoint), so those are separate entries — but every one of them
heartbeats the same machine-wide in-flight count, so the entries fill up together
and the pool behaves as one rather than advertising N times the machine.

`REGISTER`, `HEARTBEAT`, `LEASE` and `RELEASE` go to the scheduler, along with the
four cluster-administration verbs (`CLUSTER-STATUS` `0x08`, `CLUSTER-SET` `0x09`,
`CLUSTER-FORGET` `0x0a`, `CLUSTER-ADMIT` `0x0b`), which the **leader** answers and
only to a member. `COMPILE` goes to a worker on the **same** `--listen-node` port
that carries its cache verbs and, where the node's mode serves them, the scheduler's:
[#290](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/290) merged what were
three ports into one `0xFC` surface, so the listener is no longer the policy. Which
caller is admitted to which verb is a property of the **verb**, asked of the
component that owns it, and never of the port a frame arrived on. A verb this node
runs no component for is refused `unknown-opcode`: that is the honest code, because
this endpoint really does not implement it, and a client learns so rather than
seeing a dropped connection it cannot tell from a dead host. It is emphatically not
`dispatch-not-permitted`, which says the verb is served **somewhere else** — that is
what `pace-kv` answers a scheduling verb, two paragraphs up. The distinction is
the client's: `unknown-opcode` is the one refusal a launcher steps over before
carrying on, and `dispatch-not-permitted` is one it treats as fatal, so the wrong
code here is a worker that never joins and a cache that never hits, behind a green
build. A node with no cache tier and no scheduler is the ordinary shape, not a
misconfiguration, so this is what a **healthy** build answers.
`AUTH` is the exception across a node's three verb families — the scheduler's, the
compile verbs and the cache tier's, all of them now on that one port — none of which
implements it, so each answers `unknown-opcode`, the one refusal a client steps over
before carrying on unauthenticated. `pace-kv` does
implement `AUTH`: it is the only server on this wire that checks a credential, and
`--requirepass` there refuses the gated verbs `unauthenticated` rather than stepping
over anything.

                                              -> [exitCode][object][stdout][stderr][correlation][signature]
RELEASE    [leaseToken][objectKey]                          -> Ok
```

`capacity` and `load` are **nested** records rather than fields of their own, and
that is a compatibility property rather than tidiness: the top-level field count
of each verb is exact and fixed forever, so a fact added there would make two
builds of one fleet unable to speak at all. The nested records are read with the
variable-arity split, so a node built before a field existed simply reports
nothing for it and a newer node registering with an older leader has it skipped.
`capacity` is what the machine *is* — cores, memory, node class, reserve, the
software version and the cache budgets; `load` is what it is *doing* — CPU busy,
available memory, free scratch and what its cache holds. `inFlight` stays outside
the nested record, because it is the one number a worker can never fail to have.

`sourceName` is the client's translation unit **as the build system spelled it**,
directory and all. A compiler records the name of the file it was handed, so an object
built under an invented name is gratuitously different from a locally built one — and
clang takes that name from the *input file path* rather than from the `#line` marker,
so a dispatched object recorded the worker's per-job scratch directory until
[#660](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/660). That directory
carries a counter, so two dispatches of one translation unit produced two different
objects under one cache key.

The worker uses it two ways and they are not the same kind of use. It **sanitizes** it
down to a single safe component to name its scratch file — a string off a socket that
becomes a path, so nothing in it may decide a directory — and it puts the value
**verbatim** on the right-hand side of a `-fdebug-prefix-map` rule whose left-hand side
is that scratch file, which is what makes the recorded name the client's. A rule's
replacement is a string the compiler records, never a path anything opens. It never
decides the language either — the client states that explicitly.

`correlation` is what ties a reply to the request that asked for it, and it is the
one field on this wire that exists only to catch a defect. Everything else here is
upstream of the reply — the key covers the inputs, the fingerprint covers the
toolchain, the lease covers the authorization — so before it existed a client sent a
job and accepted whatever object came back on that connection. Any defect that
crossed two jobs therefore produced a build that succeeded with the **wrong object
under a correct key**: silent, stored, and then served to every other machine that
fetched that key.

It is a digest of what the worker **actually compiled** — the preprocessed text it
wrote to scratch, the client's own argument slice as the worker decoded it, the
fingerprint and the source name — taken inside the worker's runner from the values
it was about to spawn with, never recomputed from the decoded request. A digest
taken at the wire layer would agree with whatever it was compared against, because
at that layer both of two crossed requests are still pristine. The client recomputes
the same digest from what it asked for and **refuses** a reply that does not match,
before the object envelope is opened. There is no best-effort match and no fallback
to using the object anyway: a mismatch means the translation unit is compiled
locally, and the launcher says so unconditionally on stderr rather than only under
`PACE_VERBOSE`. `pace-cc --show-stats` ranks it as a fall-back reason.

It is integrity against **accident**, not against a hostile worker: the digest is
unkeyed, so a worker that can return a wrong object can return a wrong digest just
as easily. It also cannot see a runner that fed the right bytes and read back the
wrong object file — there the metadata is honest and only the object is foreign, and
the worker's exclusive scratch claim is what closes that.

**Against a machine that is not the worker, the reply is SIGNED.** An endpoint is a
name, and a name can come to answer on another machine — a VPN address reassigned
between a heartbeat and a compile, a DNS record with a long TTL. Such a machine can
accept the job and return a well-formed, correctly correlated object, and before the
signature that object was stored here and written through to the fleet's shared tier.
So the grant names the granted worker's identity public key — `workerKey`, the key the
worker's `REGISTER` connection **proved**, 32 bytes — and the worker signs
`(correlation, SHA-256 of the object as sent)` under that key, as the label
`fastcache-compile-reply-v1` followed by the two fields length-prefixed: `signature`,
64 bytes. The launcher checks it against the key the grant named **before** it opens
the object envelope or stores anything; a missing or wrong signature is refused as
`UNAUTHENTICATED` on `--show-stats`, the translation unit is compiled locally, and the
lease is released like every other way out of a grant. A grant that names no key is
refused the same way **before** anything is dialled, because it names nobody whose
reply could be accepted.

The key travels twice and the two copies answer different questions. In the clear on
the grant it is what the **client** verifies against — a client verifies no lease
claims. Inside the lease token's signed claims (token layout 4, label
`fastcache-lease-v4`) it is what the **worker** checks against its own key, so a fleet
worker that has come to hold another worker's endpoint refuses the job
`lease-endpoint-mismatch`, naming *another identity key*, before a compiler runs.
Neither field moved the wire version: the field counts of the grant and the reply are
exact, and a peer of the other count is one this build does not read.

Two rules carry the weight and neither is configurable. A job goes only to a
worker whose fingerprint is **byte-identical**: an over-strict match costs a
local compile, an over-loose one produces a silently wrong object stored under a
key other machines fetch, and those errors are not symmetric. And the scheduler
picks the worker with the most **free slots**, ties broken by utilization —
not the one running the fewest jobs, which treats every machine as an identical
box and sends work to the smallest ones first.

The scheduler also suppresses duplicate work: when many clients miss the same key
at once — the ordinary shape of a miss after a header change — only the first is
dispatched and the rest compile locally. That check runs **before** the capacity
check, so a second client asking for a key already in flight at a busy fleet is
told `already-in-flight` rather than `no-capacity`: both are true, but only one of
them is something an operator can act on.

### A lease has three transitions, and only two of them are automatic

`LEASE` takes one, `RELEASE` resolves it, and the scheduler expires whatever is
left. The client sends `RELEASE` on **every** way its job can end — an object
built, a worker that refused it, a worker that could not be reached — because the
client is who the lease was issued to and the only party that sees all three.

Expiry is the safety net for a client that **died**, `Ctrl-C` on a build being the
ordinary case, and is not the ordinary path. It used to be: there was no `RELEASE`,
so every key stayed suppressed for the full lease lifetime — ten minutes — and
recompiling the same translation unit inside that window fell back to a local
compile. The same applies to a machine leaving the fleet: dropping a worker
releases the leases held against it, rather than leaving its keys pinned until each
one times out.

`RELEASE` names the **key** as well as the token, and that is not redundant. A
token is a small integer the scheduler minted, and its counter starts again at one
in a scheduler that has just restarted — so a client reporting a job it began
before the restart would otherwise resolve whatever lease the new instance had
since issued under the same number, freeing a key somebody is building. Naming
both makes a release resolve the client's own lease or nothing.

A `RELEASE` the scheduler cannot match is refused
`unknown-lease` rather than accepted quietly. That is the diagnostic for a job
that outlived its lease, which means the fleet's lease timeout is shorter than its
slowest translation unit — and there is nowhere else that fact could be observed.
The client does nothing about it either way; whether it has an object depends on the
worker, which declines to serve one produced past the grant's own expiry
(`lease-expired`), because by then the scheduler has reclaimed the key and may have
re-granted it. Either way the invocation falls back to a local compile, and the
remedy is the same: raise `lease-lifetime`.

**How long a lease lives travels on the grant**, as `leaseLifetime`, in the clear
beside the token. It is a replicated cluster setting (`lease-lifetime`) rather than a
constant each end compiles in, so the number has to reach the client somehow — and
the client holds no roster to verify the token's signature against, so reading it out
of the token's authenticated claims is not open to it. Handing it a way to read claims
*without* checking them would put exactly the primitive the verify-first rule forbids
into a header every binary includes; what the client needs is not a claim about the token but its own budget,
from the scheduler that is already telling it which worker to dial.

The worker reads the same number from inside the MAC, where it belongs, because the
worker *can* verify. Both ends therefore bound the same job by the same **moment** —
the grant's expiry — and the scheduler reclaims the key at it. A grant already minted
keeps the bound it was issued under, whatever the setting does afterwards.

The moment rather than the number, and the difference is the client's: a lifetime runs
end to end from the mint, while the client's compile leg does not start until the
`LEASE` round trip is over, so it subtracts what that round trip cost before using the
value. It measures that on its own monotonic clock, from its own `LEASE` send, and no
instant crosses the wire — an instant from another machine would be a comparison
against a clock this one has no relationship with. The mint happened somewhere inside
that round trip, so charging the whole of it over-states the elapsed and the client
gives up a little early rather than a little late. Taking the lifetime whole made it
wait past its own grant by roughly a round trip
([#1122](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1122)), which was
harmless only because the worker declines an outrun job first.

### ADMIT, SETTLE and MACHINE-BUDGET

Version 16 puts a queue in front of the fleet's capacity. Three verbs, all of the scheduler
family and all `RequiresAuth`; a cache listener refuses them `dispatch-not-permitted` for the
reason it refuses `LEASE`, and a node that runs no consensus the same.

```
ADMIT           [0xFC][ver][0x22][u32 len]  payload: [kind][fingerprint][cacheKey][sourcePath]
                                                    [treeLabel][storable][codecs][exclusions]
  reply Ok:                                         [kind][endpoint][leaseToken][codecs]
                                                    [u64 chargedBytes][u64 queuedMs]
SETTLE          [0xFC][ver][0x23][u32 len]  payload: [outcome][peakBytes]
  reply Ok:                                         empty
MACHINE-BUDGET  [0xFC][ver][0x24][u32 len]  payload: [u64 memoryBudget][u32 slots][u32 heldSlots]
                                                    [u64 heldBytes][peaks]
  reply Ok:                                         empty
```

`ADMIT` asks the fleet's leader to admit one compile: it waits for the memory the compile is
estimated to need and is then told where it runs. Because a queue is as long as it is, the reply
may be preceded by any number of `Progress` pulses -- the second verb, after `COMPILE`, allowed
one -- which is what lets a client tell a queued request from a dead leader against its sliding
idle bound. `kind` is one byte, `0` dispatchable or `1` local-only (it must run on the machine
that asked); `storable` is `0` or `1`; `codecs` and `exclusions` are the lists `LEASE` carries.
`cacheKey` is at most 64 bytes, `fingerprint` at most 64, `sourcePath` (root-relative) at most 512
and `treeLabel` at most 256; a field over its cap is refused `malformed-frame`, never truncated.

The grant's `kind` is `0` a worker (`endpoint` and `leaseToken` name it), `1` the machine that
asked, or `2` stored -- another compile of the same key finished and stored the object, so the
client fetches it. `chargedBytes` is the memory estimate charged for the admission and `queuedMs`
how long it waited. Every byte is pinned: an `AdmitKind`, `GrantKind` or `SettleOutcome` past its
last value is refused.

`SETTLE` tells the leader how an admitted compile ended, **on the connection that admitted it** --
the charge is scoped to the connection, so it carries no lease token, and the leader releases
whatever a connection still holds when it closes. `outcome` is `0` stored, `1` not stored, `2`
failed or `3` the worker refused the job. `peakBytes` is the measured peak as a big-endian `u64`,
or an **empty** field when none was measured: absent is not zero.

`MACHINE-BUDGET` is a node reporting its own ledger -- the memory it will let compiles hold, its
slots and what is held now, with a bounded sample of measured peaks. It is a machine speaking for
itself, so it requires a proven node identity exactly as `REGISTER` does. `peaks` is one nested
field list of at most 64 entries, each four fields: cache key, source path, compiler identity and
the peak as a `u64`.

All three are capped at the control ceiling, 64 KiB.

### Bulk fields carry a codec envelope

A preprocessed translation unit and an object file are both large, so those
fields travel as `[u8 codec][u32 rawLen][bytes]` using the same codec ids the
cache already documents. The request carries the list of codecs the sender
accepts and the reply picks one from it, so the two ends agree with **no extra
round trip** — the same reasoning that keeps `AUTH` free. `rawLen` is what lets
a receiver reject a declared expansion before decompressing a byte, and nothing
in common falls back to `Identity` rather than refusing, so a build never loses
its cache because two peers were compiled with different codec sets.

### Control verbs have a lower ceiling

`REGISTER`, `HEARTBEAT`, `LEASE`, `RELEASE`, `ADMIT`, `SETTLE` and `MACHINE-BUDGET` are capped at 64 KiB rather than the
session cap. That listener is meant to be reachable by a whole fleet, and a scheduler
that can be made to allocate 256 MiB per frame by anything that authenticated
once is a scheduler that stops scheduling. `COMPILE` is the deliberate exception,
since it carries a whole translation unit.

## Node identity and sealed frames

A machine that **joins the fleet** — registers a worker, announces itself, heartbeats,
withdraws — proves which machine it is before it sends any of those verbs, and every frame
after that proof is sealed ([#178](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/178)).
A client asking for a lease or a cache entry runs no handshake and pays no round trip for
any of this. A remote one proves its machine with a machine ticket instead (`AUTH`, below);
only a loopback caller is admitted by its address, and `--fleet-open` admits everyone.

```
NODE-CHALLENGE 0x18  [nonceC(32)][ephC(32)]
                  -> [serverId][serverKey(32)][nonceS(32)][ephS(32)][signature(64)]
PROVE-NODE     0x19  [nodeId][publicKey(32)][signature(64)]
                  -> Ok, or a refusal -- sealed either way once keys are agreed
```

1. The caller opens with a fresh nonce and a fresh X25519 ephemeral key.
2. The server answers with its node id, its identity key, a nonce and an ephemeral key of
   its own, and an Ed25519 signature over all of them **and** the caller's two, under the
   label `fastcache-node-challenge-v2`. A caller that holds a roster of the cluster's voters
   checks it before proving anything, and so learns whether it reached a voter, a machine
   the cluster has revoked, or something it cannot vouch for.
3. The caller signs that whole transcript, the server's signature included, plus its own
   id and key, under `fastcache-node-proof-v2`, and sends PROVE-NODE. The server checks the
   signature first (`node-proof-rejected`), then the cluster's roster: a key it does not
   hold for that id is `node-key-unknown`, a key it has revoked is `node-key-revoked`.

Both ends then derive two session keys — HKDF-SHA256 over the X25519 shared secret, salted
with both nonces, bound to both ephemeral keys and both ids — one for each direction. **The
answer to PROVE-NODE is the first sealed frame**, whatever it says: from it on, every frame
both ways carries a 32-byte HMAC-SHA256 tag after its payload, over an implicit position,
the frame's header and its payload. A frame whose tag does not verify, one that is replayed,
one sent under the other direction's key, or one longer than a frame may be closes the
connection, unanswered.

A sealed frame is held whole until its tag can be checked, and that holding is charged to the
node's in-flight byte budget. A frame the budget has no room for is refused as soon as its
header arrives: the peer is answered `endpoint-busy`, sealed, and the connection then closes.
It closes rather than skipping the frame because the frame's length is not verified until its
tag is, and skipping a length nobody verified would let whoever wrote it choose where the next
frame starts. A caller that reads `endpoint-busy` here proves again on a fresh connection.

**The seal is what makes the proof worth having.** Without it, a machine on the path could
relay a genuine worker's handshake to the scheduler, watch it succeed, and then write a
REGISTER of its own into the connection the worker's proof admitted — naming an endpoint of
its choosing and being leased the fleet's jobs. It holds neither session key, so it cannot
tag that frame.

A challenge is spent whatever the outcome, and asking for a second one abandons the first.
A connection proves **once**: either verb on a connection that has already proved, or that
is already sealed, closes it, so a caller refused for its key redials rather than trying
again in place. Bytes a caller pipelined behind PROVE-NODE close the connection too — they
arrived in the clear, before the seal existed, so nothing can say whose they are.

A worker holds its identity key in `--cluster-dir`, which it mints on first start; the
cluster admits the key through an enrollment window, as a learner, and forgets it — refusing it from every address — with `--cluster-forget`. What
an operator sees of all of this is on the
[node's page](../tools/pace-node.md#a-node-proves-which-machine-it-is-and-every-frame-after-it-is-sealed).

## Authentication

When the daemon runs with `--requirepass`, every verb except AUTH is refused with
`unauthenticated` until an AUTH frame has been accepted on that connection.

This handler was for a long time the only one in the tree that did not check the
configured credential: memcached text, memcached binary and RESP all did, so a
daemon started with `--requirepass` gated those three and served the compile
cache to anyone who could open a socket.

Which verbs are reachable before a credential is a **column of the opcode table**
(`OpDescriptor::preAuth`), not a condition written into the handler. A verb added
without a thought about it defaults to closed, and the gate reports "not allowed"
for an opcode it does not recognise at all.

### Why it costs no round trip

Authentication is per-connection state, and the launcher opens a fresh connection
per *operation* — so sending AUTH, awaiting its reply, and then sending the real
command would double the round trips of every translation unit in a build. That
is exactly the cost [the no-handshake decision](#why-there-is-no-handshake)
exists to avoid.

It does not have to be spelled that way. Replies are strictly ordered and
one-per-request, so a client **pipelines**: AUTH and the real command go out in a
single write, and the two replies are read in order afterwards. The credential
costs a few dozen bytes in a segment that was being sent anyway. `pace-cc`
does exactly this, and asserts it — a unit test checks the write *count*, because
the bytes are identical either way and only the call count distinguishes a
pipelined credential from one that waited.

A client must still read the AUTH reply. Skipping it on the assumption it
succeeded strands a whole frame in the socket, and the next command on that
connection reads the previous one's answer.

### Refusals and reloads

A failed AUTH is answered and the connection kept, as every other handler here
does: a refusal is a reply, not a close. Closing would not slow an attacker
down — reconnecting is free — while costing every honest launcher its pipelining.

The policy is resolved once per command from the live auth source, so a `SIGHUP`
that **enables** `requirepass` gates connections that are already open, and one
that disables it releases them. A connection that has actually *verified* a
credential keeps its access across a secret **rotation**, as redis does:
re-gating on rotation would fail every in-flight build at the moment an operator
rotates, which is what makes rotation something nobody dares do.

Against a daemon with no credential configured, an AUTH frame is answered `Ok`
and ignored, so setting `PACE_TOKEN` is safe in a mixed fleet. It does not
mark the connection as verified, though — nothing was checked — so a later reload
that enables auth gates it like any other.

### Against a daemon that predates AUTH

The AUTH opcode was added **without** bumping `CurrentVersion`, because the
framing was built precisely so a receiver can step over a verb it does not know:
an older daemon answers `unknown-opcode`, skips the payload, and serves the
pipelined command behind it perfectly well.

A client must therefore treat `unknown-opcode` **on AUTH** as "this daemon has no
authentication", not as a failed exchange. Returning it as the outcome instead
gives a token-configured launcher a permanent 0% hit rate against every
not-yet-upgraded daemon, reported as `rejected (unknown-opcode)` — a regression
with a plausible-looking error message and no obvious cause. `pace-cc` falls
through to the command's own reply and sets `credentialIgnored`, which surfaces
once per build as a verbose note: the operator asked for authentication and did
not get it, and a cache that silently does less than it was told to is worse than
one that says so. Every *other* refusal is about the credential itself and is
still reported.

### Payload ceilings

AUTH is the one verb reachable before authentication, which makes it the one hole
in the gate above: without a bound of its own it would be read with the session's
`maxPayloadBytes` (256 MiB by default), handing an unauthenticated peer exactly
the allocation the gate exists to deny. So the opcode table carries a
`maxPayload` column — `MaxAuthPayload` (4 KiB) for AUTH, and `0` ("the session
cap") for STORE and FETCH, which carry object files and are read only after the
peer has authenticated. A `static_assert` requires every `preAuth` row to declare
a non-zero ceiling, so a future pre-auth verb cannot reopen the hole by omission.
An over-ceiling frame is drained and answered like any other refusal, and names
the verb whose cap it hit rather than the session's.

## Versioning

The version byte travels on every request, and the server pins it to the first
command's for the life of the connection: a stream that changes version
mid-flight is nonsensical rather than merely unsupported, and saying so is
cheaper than carrying two decoders.

Rejection policy, per command:

| Condition | Reply | Connection |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| bad magic | none possible | closed |
| version unsupported, or changed mid-connection | Error / unsupported-version | closed |
| payload over the session cap | Error / payload-too-large | closed |
| unknown opcode | Error / unknown-opcode | **stays open** |
| fields ≠ declared payload | Error / malformed-frame | stays open |

A wrong magic is the only case that still closes without a reply: the peer is
not speaking this protocol, so there is no framing in which an answer would be
meaningful. Every other refusal is a typed reply, and every one is also reported
through the daemon's connection logger, so a rejection is visible to the
operator as well as to the client.

An `unsupported-version` message names the offered version *and* the supported
range (`unsupported wire version 14; this server speaks 16..16`). A rejection that
does not say what would have worked cannot be acted on, and this is the only
message an operator with a mismatched install will ever see.

### Why there is no handshake

There is no HELLO and no negotiation round trip on the cache path. `pace-cc` opens a **fresh
connection per operation** — manifest fetch, object fetch, object store,
manifest store — so a handshake would cost two to four extra round trips *per
translation unit*, on the hot path where this project has already measured
serious regressions. Instead the client optimistically sends its current version
and learns the server's range from the rejection if it is wrong: zero cost in the
common case, one wasted round trip in the case that is already broken.

Because both binaries ship in one package, version skew is an operator error — a
mixed install — so the goal here is a loud diagnostic, not automatic interop.

The [node handshake](#node-identity-and-sealed-frames) is not an exception to this: it
negotiates no version and no feature, it establishes WHICH machine is on the other end,
and it is paid only by a machine joining the fleet, once per connection, never by a
translation unit.

### Two independent version axes

The wire version describes the *framing*; `CompileValueVersion`, the first byte
of a stored blob, describes the *value format*. They are separate because a
stored blob outlives any connection: the wire version is agreed per request,
while the blob's version is discovered when it is decoded, however long after it
was written. The launcher's cache key additionally carries an `objkey-v7` schema
tag; bumping it re-keys the cache, so stale entries miss and are rewritten rather
than being served under rules they were not written by.

Those two tags move **independently**, and it matters which one is load-bearing
here. Nothing couples a `CompileValueVersion` bump to an `objkey-v*` bump — the
lock-step this project does enforce is `manifest-v*` behind `objkey-v*`, a
different pair — so a canonicalization change need not re-key anything, and two
generations can therefore meet over one key. Re-keying is an optimisation that
makes them meet less often; the refusal below is the protection that does not
depend on anybody having remembered to bump a second tag.

`CompileValueVersion` names the **canonicalization spec**, not only the byte
layout. Canonical text travels nowhere but inside a stored value, and every server
on this wire has to rewrite one identically — including servers at different
builds, since a fleet is permanently mid-upgrade. So the byte is pinned to the
behaviour rather than maintained by hand: a conformance corpus is run through the
canonicalizer and its inverse, digested, and matched against the row for the live
generation. Change how a path span is found, rewritten or framed and that test
fails naming the bump.

A reader that meets a generation it does not implement **refuses the value**. It
cannot canonicalize it, and storing or serving it uncanonicalized would put the
producing checkout's absolute paths into a shared cache under a key every machine
computes — so a store is declined as `foreign-value-generation` (`0x1e`), naming
both generations in the message, and a fetch is a miss the launcher reports
under its own `--show-stats` reason rather than as a malformed value. That code
is the point rather than a detail: the refusal is what a *healthy* fleet does
midway through a rolling upgrade, and answering it as `malformed-value` told an
operator their cache was damaged — the same conflation the storage layer already
avoids on disk, where a store written by another build is
`UnsupportedFormatVersion` and never `Corrupt`, because the code is what
monitoring reads and `Corrupt` is what makes somebody delete a healthy cache.

Refusing costs the hits of one upgrade window; the alternative costs every
consumer that replays those paths into its dependency graph, where no edit in its
own checkout can invalidate them.

## The value format

A stored value is an object blob plus zero or more text regions, each tagged
with the grammar that identifies path spans inside it:

```
CompileValue {
    objectBlob:   bytes          // the .o / .obj, stored untouched
    textRegions:  [ { grammar, bytes } ]
}
```

The object blob is opaque and never rewritten. Text regions are the compiler's
captured stdout and stderr, and their grammar tells the server where the paths
are. An MSVC driver's streams carry `/showIncludes` notes AND diagnostics -- the
notes move between the two streams with the flag -- so both are tagged with one
grammar that reads every line language such a stream holds: the note, the
`<path>(<line>[,<col>]): ` diagnostic head, and the `In file included from`
chain clang-cl writes on it. A GNU driver's streams carry diagnostics, and its
dependency record is a third region in Makefile depfile syntax. Only recognised
path spans are rewritten, a span's `..` segments collapsed first where the
result lies under a root; every other byte, a caret's echoed source line
included, is preserved verbatim.

This asymmetry is the whole design: canonicalize on STORE, serve canonical on
FETCH, localize on the client. The server stores exactly one representation of
an entry no matter how many differently-rooted machines produce it.

!!! note "The region count is a claim about bytes, and it is checked against them"

    `textRegions` is length-prefixed with a 32-bit count, and a decoder must treat
    that number as an **assertion the frame either backs up or does not** — never as
    a size to allocate from. A region costs five bytes on the wire at the very least
    (its grammar tag and its length prefix), so a frame declaring more regions than
    `remaining / 5` is refused as `malformed-value` before anything is reserved.

    Unchecked, a **nine-byte** STORE payload declaring `0xFFFFFFFF` regions asked for
    roughly 172 GB — reachable on the daemon's STORE path, and from a worker's reply
    to the launcher
    ([#267](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/267)). Validating
    the count is necessary and not sufficient: a validated count is still an amplifier
    whenever the in-memory element is bigger than its wire minimum, so any capacity a
    decoder reserves is sized from something *it* owns — the bytes already in hand, or
    its own configured ceiling — never from the peer's number. The same rule governs
    the prefetch-group manifest's key list and the launcher's direct-mode manifest.

## Prefetch groups

The `prefetchGroup` field on a STORE groups keys that tend to be needed together
— in practice, one build of one project. The server records the mapping, and when
a FETCH hits a key belonging to a group it warms the rest of that group into the
in-memory tier in the background.

This is automatic and has no CLI flag. It is debounced at two levels: per
connection, and per `(engine, group)` pair. Both are necessary because a
launcher opens a fresh connection per translation unit — with only per-connection
debouncing, one 60-hit build was measured issuing 27022 prefetches and 13969
disk reads. A group holds at most 100 000 keys.

Prefetch group membership never affects the cache key, so changing `PACE_PREFETCH_GROUP`
re-groups prefetching without partitioning the cache or invalidating anything.

## Operational notes

The per-value cap (`--storage-max-value`, default 256 MiB) also raises the wire
frame-payload cap for this protocol, and the default is already sized for object
files in a large codebase. See
[running a compile cache](../operations/compile-cache-server.md).

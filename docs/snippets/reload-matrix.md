<!-- reloadable-for: pace-kv -->
<!-- Checked against CliOptions() by ctest -R reloadable-docs. A setting added to
     or removed from the reloadable column of that table without this row moving is a
     refusal, in BOTH directions: an omission costs a reader a stale page, and an
     over-claim costs an operator, who edits the file, sends SIGHUP, sees no error and
     believes a setting is in force that is not (#1070). -->

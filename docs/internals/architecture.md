# Architecture

fastcached is a layered C++23 server. Each layer reaches its
collaborators through a narrow interface, which keeps the whole
thing testable end-to-end against an in-memory transport.

## Concurrency model

fastcached is built on **single-threaded reactors**. One `IReactor`
(epoll / kqueue / IOCP) owns an event loop on exactly one thread; every
connection it accepts is **pinned to that reactor for its whole life**, so
all of a connection's I/O and state mutation happen on one thread. There is
no work-stealing and no per-request locking on the cache hot path.

`--threads N` runs `N` independent reactors, each pinned to its own CPU core
(`PinCallingThreadToCpu`, best-effort). How connections reach a reactor
differs by platform:

- **POSIX (Linux/macOS):** one listener per reactor, all bound with
  `SO_REUSEPORT` (`core::net::PortSharing::Shared`). On Linux the kernel
  load-balances incoming connections across the listeners, so each reactor
  accepts and serves its own share directly — no cross-thread handoff. macOS
  binds them but hands every connection to the newest listener, so there one
  reactor serves them all.
- **Windows:** IOCP has no `SO_REUSEPORT`, so a blocking acceptor thread per
  bind round-robins accepted sockets across the IOCP reactors. Each handed-off
  socket runs `co_await ResumeOn{reactor}` first, which re-schedules the
  coroutine onto the target reactor's thread, and only there hands the raw
  handle to `core::net::adoptSocket` — restoring the "one connection, one
  reactor thread" invariant. **No completion port is ever drained from several
  threads**: that would migrate a coroutine across threads, and
  `RunMultiReactorWindows` runs one thread per reactor exactly as the POSIX
  path does. This page claimed the
  opposite — several threads draining one IOCP so a page-store `fsync` overlaps
  serving other connections — until
  [#896](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/896); that
  mechanism is in no source.

The disk backend is always wrapped in a thread-safe `ShardedStorage`, but that
is not a Windows property and the paragraph above is not its reason.
`main.cpp` wraps whenever more than one thread can reach the storage, and the
persistent backend is one of four conditions that say so — the others being an
explicit multi-shard layout, the reactor running on more than one thread (the
default, since `--threads` unset means `hardware_concurrency()`), and the
metrics endpoint, whose `fc-admin` thread calls `engine.Snapshot()`
concurrently with the reactor.

See `Server/ReactorServerLoop.cpp` for both paths.

## Coroutine architecture

The server is one big tree of C++20 coroutines driven by a reactor. Two
coroutine *types* exist, and the choice between them is the whole design:

### `Task<T>` — lazy, owned, awaited

`Async/Task.hpp` defines `Task<T>` (and `Task<void>`). Its promise's
`initial_suspend()` returns `std::suspend_always`, so a `Task` is **lazy**:
constructing it runs none of the body. It starts only when it is driven —
either awaited from another coroutine, or run to completion by `SyncRun`
(tests and early startup, before a reactor exists).

When one `Task` `co_await`s another, the awaiter stores the awaiting
coroutine as the callee's *continuation* and hands control to the callee via
**symmetric transfer** — `await_suspend` returns a `coroutine_handle<>`
instead of `void`, so the compiler tail-resumes it without growing the C
stack. The matching `FinalAwaiter::await_suspend` (`Async/Task.hpp:35`)
returns the continuation, transferring straight back to the awaiter at
`co_return`. A deep chain of `co_await`s therefore runs in **O(1) stack
space**. `Task<T>::Awaiter` owns the callee's coroutine handle and destroys
the frame when the await leaves scope (RAII).

### `DetachedTask` — eager, fire-and-forget

`Async/Task.hpp:347` defines `DetachedTask`: `initial_suspend` and
`final_suspend` are both `std::suspend_never`, so it **starts eagerly** and
its frame **self-destructs** at `co_return`. Nobody holds a handle to it.
Crucially, `unhandled_exception()` calls `std::terminate()` — an exception
escaping a connection would otherwise tear down the whole daemon — so every
`DetachedTask` body is wrapped in a catch-all *firewall* that logs and drops
only that one connection (`RunConnectionDetached` in `Server.cpp`,
`RunHandedOffConnection` in `ReactorServerLoop.cpp`).

### How a connection is driven, end to end

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R as Reactor loop
    participant A as Server::Run (accept, Task)
    participant D as DetachedTask (per client)
    participant C as Connection::Run (Task)
    participant H as Protocol handler (Task)

    A->>R: co_await listener.Accept()  (suspends)
    R-->>A: client connected → resume
    A->>D: spawn DetachedTask (eager start)
    A->>R: loop back to Accept (suspends)
    D->>C: co_await connection.Run()
    C->>C: co_await HandshakeIfNeeded() (TLS, no-op for plaintext)
    C->>C: co_await DetectProtocol()
    C->>H: co_await handler.Run()  (read → parse → dispatch → write loop)
    H-->>C: returns when client quits / disconnects
    C->>C: socket.Close()
    D->>D: co_return → frame self-destructs
```

- `Server::Run()` (`Server.cpp:59`) is itself a `Task<void>` — the accept
  loop. It `co_await`s `_listener.Accept()`; the reactor resumes it when a
  client connects.
- Each accepted client is spawned as a `DetachedTask` and the accept loop
  immediately loops back. The server keeps **no handle** to the connection;
  the frame owns its own lifetime and is driven forward only by reactor
  resumptions of its suspended I/O.
- `Connection::Run()` (`Connection.cpp:25`) sequences: transport handshake →
  protocol autodetect → dispatch to the matching protocol handler. The
  per-request loop (read → parse → dispatch → write) lives in the handler
  (`MemcachedTextHandler` / `MemcachedBinaryHandler` / `RedisRespHandler`),
  not in `Connection` itself.

### Synchronous storage, asynchronous I/O — the key decision

Only operations that genuinely *wait on the outside world* are coroutines:
socket reads/writes, the TLS handshake, and the blocking Redis verbs (`BLPOP`
has no analogue here, but `XREAD … BLOCK` does). **Cache operations are plain
synchronous calls.** `CacheEngine::Get/Set/Add/...` return
`std::expected<T, StorageError>` and are *never* `co_await`-ed — the hot path
inside a handler is:

```cpp
auto result = engine->Get(key);          // synchronous, microseconds
co_return co_await WriteAll(socket, ...); // only the socket write suspends
```

This is deliberate. Storage lookups hit in-memory structures (LRU hash / CoW
B+tree) and complete in microseconds; making them awaitable would add
suspend/resume overhead and frame churn for no latency win, and would force
locking concerns onto a path that is single-threaded by construction. So the
rule is: **suspend for I/O, run straight through for compute.**

### The reactor contract

`IReactor` (`Async/IReactor.hpp`) is the seam everything async hangs off:

| Method | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `Run()` | Block on the event loop until `Stop()` and the ready queue drains. |
| `Stop() noexcept` | Ask `Run()` to exit; idempotent; callable from any thread. |
| `Submit(handle)` | Post a coroutine to resume on the reactor thread (FIFO). |
| `Schedule(deadline, handle)` | Resume a coroutine when the clock reaches `deadline`. |
| `Clock()` | The `IClock` used for all deadline checks. |

One reactor per thread. `Submit` and `Schedule` are safe to call from any
thread (production reactors wake the loop via an eventfd/pipe/IOCP post). The
clock is injected: tests downcast to `ManualClock` and `Advance()` to drive
timers deterministically.

Production injects a `CachedClock` — a `SteadyClock` wrapper serving a value
the loop re-samples, rather than a time source read per call. `IClock::Refresh()`
is that seam, and only whoever owns an event loop can drive it, which is why the
daemon hands the *same* clock object to `CacheEngine` and to
`ReactorServerOptions::clock` instead of letting each build its own. Each
iteration refreshes twice, and neither call is redundant:

- **After the blocking wait returns**, so every handler and timer resumed by
  that iteration sees the instant the wait actually ended at. Refreshing only at
  the top of the loop would freeze an idle daemon's clock for the length of its
  sleep.
- **Before the next wait's timeout is computed**, so the timeout is not
  overstated by however long the previous batch took to process — which would
  make every timer fire a batch late.

A command therefore reads a time that is stale by at most one batch's processing
time, never by a sleep, and TTLs are expressed in seconds. What that buys is on
the [Performance](performance.md) page: a clock read costs about half a sharded
lookup, and the engine performs one per command. Readers outside the loop —
uptime for `/metrics`, startup logging — keep the real `SteadyClock`, because a
cached value stops advancing exactly when the daemon has nothing to do.

#### Readiness vs completion

`IoAwaitable` is a single, completion-shaped facade over two very different
OS models:

| | epoll (Linux) / kqueue (macOS) | IOCP (Windows) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model | **Readiness** — OS says "fd is now readable/writable" | **Completion** — OS says "this read of N bytes is done" |
| Per op | Try the syscall first; on `EAGAIN`, arm interest and park; the reactor retries on the next readiness event | Submit `WSARecv`/`WSASend` with an `OVERLAPPED`; the reactor dispatches when the completion is dequeued |
| Sync fast path | Yes — a `recv` that succeeds immediately resolves the awaitable as already-ready, no suspension | No — every op is submitted to the OS |

The awaitable hides this: the handler always just writes
`co_await socket->Read(buf)` and gets back an `IoResult`
(`std::expected<std::size_t, NetError>`).

## Awaitable taxonomy

Every awaitable in the codebase, what its `await_suspend` returns, and why:

| Awaitable | Defined in | `await_suspend` → | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Task<T>::Awaiter` / `Task<void>::Awaiter` | `Async/Task.hpp` | `coroutine_handle<>` (symmetric transfer) | Await one `Task` from another; owns the callee frame, destroys it on scope exit. |
| `TaskPromiseBase::FinalAwaiter` | `Async/Task.hpp:35` | `coroutine_handle<>` (continuation) | `final_suspend` transfers straight back to the awaiter — zero C-stack growth on chains. |
| `IoAwaitable` | `Net/ISocket.hpp:27` | **`bool`** | `Read`/`Write`/`WriteVectored`/`WaitReadable`. The `bool` return is the subtle bit — see below. |
| `AcceptAwaitable` | `Net/IListener.hpp:30` | `void` | `IListener::Accept()`; always suspends, resumed via `Complete()`. |
| `ResumeOn` | `Async/ResumeOn.hpp:17` | `void` | Hop a coroutine onto a target reactor's thread via `IReactor::Submit` (the Windows connection handoff). |
| `SleepUntil` / `SleepFor` | `Async/SleepUntil.hpp` | `void` | Timer wait built on `IReactor::Schedule`; `SleepFor` is the relative-delay convenience. Used for `XREAD BLOCK` timeouts. |
| `StreamWaiter::Awaiter` | `Protocol/RedisResp.cpp` | `bool` | Park a blocking `XREAD`/`XREADGROUP` until one of three arms fires: an `XADD` wakes it, the timer expires, or the client disconnects. A one-shot latch makes the race safe. |
| `SuspendOnLatch` / `WakeLatch` | `Protocol/RedisResp.cpp` | (latch) | Park the pub/sub subscribe loop until a delivered message *or* an incoming client command wakes it. |
| `std::suspend_always` / `std::suspend_never` | `<coroutine>` | — | `Task`'s lazy initial-suspend; `DetachedTask`'s eager start and self-destructing final-suspend. |

### The `bool` await_suspend — a re-entrancy guard

Most awaitables return `void` (always suspend) or a handle (symmetric
transfer). `IoAwaitable` and `StreamWaiter::Awaiter` instead return `bool`,
to handle a backend that can **complete the operation synchronously from
inside the suspend callback** — e.g. the TLS decorator finding a whole record
already buffered, or the in-memory transport resolving inline. If such a
backend called `Complete()` (which resumes the handle) while still inside
`await_suspend`, it would resume the coroutine *re-entrantly* — undefined
behaviour, and in a loop it recurses one stack frame per op until it
overflows. The guard: while the suspend callback runs, a synchronous
`Complete()` only *records* the result (`_inSuspendCallback`), then
`await_suspend` returns `false`, telling the machinery to resume normally via
`await_resume` rather than suspend. `Net/IoAwaitable_test.cpp` proves this
holds across **200 000** synchronous completions in a loop without
overflowing.

## Awaitables we could add

The current set covers the server's needs, but a few generic primitives would
remove hand-rolled machinery if more concurrency lands:

- **`WhenAny` / `WhenAll` combinators.** The stream and pub/sub waiters today
  hand-roll their 2–3-arm races with bespoke one-shot latches
  (`StreamWaiter`, `WakeLatch`). A reusable `WhenAny` (resolve on the first
  arm, cancel the rest) would replace those latches with one tested
  primitive. Builds on the existing reactor `Submit`/`Schedule` seams.
- **A cancellation-aware awaitable.** `CancellationToken` (below) is
  poll-only today. An awaitable that resolves when a token trips would let any
  wait — a blocking `XREAD`, a long write — participate in shutdown directly,
  instead of relying on socket/listener close to unblock it.
- **An `async_scope` / structured-ownership handle.** Connections run as
  untracked `DetachedTask`s, so shutdown cannot *join* in-flight work. A scope
  that tracks spawned tasks and awaits them would enable a bounded graceful
  drain ("stop accepting, finish the N in-flight requests, then exit").
- **A reactor-backed `Yield` / reschedule.** `co_await` of a no-deadline
  `Submit` would let a long synchronous burst (e.g. a huge multi-key `MGET`)
  voluntarily yield the reactor thread for fairness. The
  `YieldAwaitable` already written in the reactor tests is exactly this shape,
  waiting to be promoted.

`SleepUntil`/`SleepFor` were themselves such a promotion: a per-protocol
`struct SleepUntil` duplicated in `RedisResp.cpp` and `IocpReactor_test.cpp`,
now a single generic awaitable in `Async/` (the timer twin of `ResumeOn`).

## Cancellation & shutdown

Cancellation is **cooperative and polling-based**, not preemptive.
`Async/Cancellation.hpp` provides `CancellationSource` (control) and
`CancellationToken` (cheap-to-copy observer) over a shared atomic flag
(`Cancel()` stores with release, `IsCancelled()` loads with acquire) — a
lighter `std::stop_token` without callbacks. Shutdown then works through the
seams that *do* unblock a parked coroutine:

- `Server::Shutdown()` sets a flag and calls `listener.Close()`, which makes
  the in-flight `Accept()` resolve with `NetErrorCode::Cancelled`, so the
  accept loop exits.
- Closing a socket makes its parked `Read`/`Write` resolve with an error, so
  the connection coroutine unwinds.

The honest current limitation: **in-flight connection coroutines are not
force-cancelled.** They end when their handler returns (client `quit`,
disconnect, or error). A structured `async_scope` (see above) is what a
bounded graceful drain would need.

## Design principles

- **`std::expected<T, E>`** for fallible API surfaces. Chained monadically
  with `and_then`, `or_else`, `transform`, `transform_error` rather than
  nested `if`s. Exceptions are reserved for programmer errors.
- **Dependency injection** for anything touching I/O, time, randomness, or the
  filesystem: `IClock`, `IReactor`, `ISocket`, `IListener`, `IStorage`,
  `ILogger`, `IDaemonHost`, `ISignalSource`, `IAdmissionControl`,
  `IMetricsSink`.
- **Data-driven design** — no magic literals; tables/descriptors are the
  source of truth (CLI flag table, storage-record layout, protocol dispatch).
- **RAII for resource handles**. Every socket, listener, log file, and
  coroutine handle is owned by an RAII wrapper (`Task<T>::Awaiter` owns and
  destroys the callee frame; `PooledBuffer` returns to its pool on destruction).

## Testing strategy

Catch2 tests live next to the implementation files: `Foo.cpp` has a
`Foo_test.cpp` (auto-collected by a `GLOB_RECURSE` in `src/tests/`). Tests
substitute deterministic fakes for the injected interfaces (`ManualClock`,
`TestReactor`, `InMemoryTransport`, `NullLogger`, `CapturingLogger`,
`ScriptedSignalSource`).

The coroutine machinery is exercised the same way: a `TestReactor` paired with
a `ManualClock` makes suspend/resume and timer firing fully deterministic —
`Submit` the entry coroutine, `Advance()` the clock, `Run()` to make progress
(see `Async/TestReactor_test.cpp`, `Async/SleepUntil_test.cpp`). The canonical
coroutine-correctness check is `Net/IoAwaitable_test.cpp`, whose
200 000-iteration loop guards against the re-entrant-resume stack overflow
described above.

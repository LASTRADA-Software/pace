# Known limitations

A single page enumerating everything pace-kv does not currently
do, so a reader evaluating the project can see the gaps in one
place.

## Protocol gaps

- **`watch` (memcached text)**: streaming event subscription is not
  implemented. Recognised commands return `OK` rather than starting
  the stream.
- **SASL authentication (memcached binary)**: the PLAIN mechanism is
  implemented and authenticates against the `--requirepass` secret. When
  no secret is configured the opcodes reply `AuthError` (as before), so
  non-authing clients fall back to the plain path. Other mechanisms
  (CRAM-MD5, SCRAM) are not supported.
- **`shutdown` (memcached text)**: not implemented. Stop the daemon
  via the OS (`Ctrl-C`, `SIGTERM`, systemd, Windows service control).
- **`stats conns` (memcached text)**: returns an empty result.
  pace-kv does not track an active-connection registry.
- **`stats sizes` (memcached text)**: returns a single approximate
  bucket because the storage engine does not track per-entry sizes
  bucketed by size class.
- **`AUTH` (Redis)**: supported when `--requirepass` is set (single
  shared secret, redis-style); with no secret configured it replies the
  redis-compatible "no password is set" error. Per-user ACLs beyond the
  single optional `--auth-username` are not supported.
- **`COMMAND DOCS` (Redis)**: replies with an empty array. `COMMAND`,
  `COMMAND COUNT` and `COMMAND INFO` are real introspection over the
  dispatch table; only the human-readable metadata is absent.
- **Redis set algebra**: `SINTER`, `SUNION`, `SDIFF`, `SRANDMEMBER`,
  `SMOVE` and `SSCAN` are not implemented. The rest of the set family is.
- **Key enumeration**: there is no `KEYS`, `SCAN`, `RANDOMKEY`, `DBSIZE`
  or `stats cachedump` on any protocol, so a client cannot list the
  keyspace. Use the `/metrics` endpoint for aggregate counts.
- **`SELECT db` (Redis)**: accepted as a no-op for any index — the
  reply is always `+OK`, but pace-kv is a single flat keyspace, so
  the index is ignored rather than selecting a distinct database.
- **Keyspace notifications for memcached and `0xFC` writes**: not fired. A
  memcached `set`/`delete`/`incr`, and a compile-cache `store` or
  `cache-drop`, dirties a Redis `WATCH` (the storage layer does that for
  every protocol), but publishes no `__keyevent@0__:*` frame. Neither
  protocol has a convention for keyspace events, and the event names belong
  to the Redis verbs that own them.

## Keyspace notification timing

`notify-keyspace-events` accepts the full redis flag set, `x` (expired) and
`e` (evicted) included, and both events are published — but **when** an
`expired` event fires differs from redis, and a subscriber depending on it
should know how.

**The rule: `expired` fires when the entry is *reclaimed*, not when its TTL
lapses.** Everything below follows from that.

- **An active expiry cycle sweeps on a timer**, so a key that lapses and is
  never touched again is still reclaimed and still reported — redis's `hz` is
  the analogue. It runs every `active_expiry_interval` (`1s` by default),
  examines `active_expiry_scan` entries per shard per sweep
  (`512`), and resumes where the last sweep stopped rather than restarting at
  the front, so its cost per cycle is fixed rather than proportional to how
  much is cached.
  It backs off towards 30s while it finds nothing and returns to the base
  interval the moment it does.

  **The delay is therefore bounded, not zero.** An `expired` event for an
  untouched key arrives at the next sweep that reaches it, which on a cache
  larger than one scan budget is several cycles rather than one. Setting
  `active_expiry_interval: 0s` (or `--expiry-interval=0s`) turns the cycle
  off and leaves expiry purely access-driven, which is what the daemon did
  before it had one.

  `fastcached_expiry_cycles_total` is flat when the cycle is disabled or
  wedged — which otherwise looks exactly like nothing having expired — and
  `fastcached_expiry_keys_reclaimed_total` counts what it found.

- **A plain `SET` over a lapsed key does not fire `expired`.** It overwrites
  the record without looking up the old one, so nothing is reclaimed — you
  get `set` and nothing else. The verbs that *do* reclaim on the spot are the
  ones that must find the key first: `DEL`, `ADD`, `EXPIRE`/`PERSIST`,
  `APPEND`, `INCR`/`DECR`, `REPLACE`, `GETSET`, and a CAS.
- **With the default `Approximate` LRU recency, a read does not reclaim
  either.** The in-memory read path is deliberately non-mutating so reads on
  one shard run concurrently, so a `GET` of a lapsed key returns a miss and
  leaves the entry for the sweep. `--lru-recency strict` reclaims on reads
  too, at the cost of serialising them per shard.
- **The persistent backend (`--storage`) reclaims on a read later than in
  memory.** `GET` and a meta no-op probe reject a lapsed record without
  erasing it: a read holds only a shared lock, and mutating the tree there
  would break the single-writer contract. Every *write* verb does erase and
  report, exactly as the in-memory tier does, so the difference is confined to
  reads and is bounded by one sweep.
- **`evicted` is immediate in memory and absent on disk.** In-memory eviction
  happens during the write that caused the memory pressure, so the event goes
  out with it. Under `--storage` no `evicted` event is emitted at all: that
  configuration is an in-memory tier mirroring a disk tier, and neither tier's
  eviction removes the key on its own — an L1 drop leaves it on disk, and a
  disk drop leaves it in the mirror, which serves reads without consulting
  disk. An event for a key the next `GET` returns would be worse than none.
- When one call reclaims more keys at once than the notification buffer
  holds — a `maxmemory` shrink on a large cache is the realistic case —
  the surplus events are dropped and counted in
  `fastcached_keyspace_reclaim_events_dropped_total`. A non-zero value
  there is the difference between "nothing expired" and "you were not told".

## Storage model differences from memcached

- No slab allocator. pace-kv uses a flat LRU. `slabs *`,
  `lru *`, and `lru_crawler *` commands are recognised as synthetic
  stubs and return `OK` without changing state.
- `stats items`, `stats slabs`, `stats sizes` therefore return
  synthetic output describing a single virtual class rather than
  real per-class breakdowns.

## Storage model differences from Redis

- No data-structure commands (lists, sets, hashes, sorted sets,
  streams, bitfields). pace-kv's engine is key-value only.
- No scripting (EVAL). Pub/sub (`SUBSCRIBE`, `PSUBSCRIBE`, `PUBLISH`,
  and the `__keyspace@0__` / `__keyevent@0__` channels) and transactions
  (`MULTI` / `EXEC` / `WATCH` / `DISCARD`) are implemented.
- No replication or cluster commands.

## Operational gaps

- No live event subscription (`watch`). Observability is via the `stats`
  snapshot and, when `--metrics` is set, a Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint
  (plus a `/healthz` liveness probe) served on a dedicated HTTP port.
- TLS termination is opt-in and only present in builds compiled with
  `-DFASTCACHED_ENABLE_TLS=ON` (links OpenSSL). Enable at runtime with
  `--tls --tls-cert <pem> --tls-key <pem>`. The default build links no
  OpenSSL and `--tls` then exits with a clear error; run behind a
  TLS-terminating proxy in that case. Client-certificate (mutual TLS)
  authentication is not yet implemented.

- **A `pace-node` fleet has no rolling upgrade.** A build accepts exactly
  one `0xFC` wire version, so the moment one end moves every peer on the old version is
  refused. Upgrading is a flag day: stop everything, upgrade every node *and every
  client*, start again. A mismatch never fails a build — the launcher treats an unusable
  cache as a miss — so the cost is quiet: the counted signal is server-side, and what a
  client says about it is said on its own machine, not yours. The procedure and what to
  watch are in [Upgrading a fleet](upgrading-a-fleet.md).

# Wire formats, protocol handlers and sockets

Rules for `src/Pace/Protocol/`, `src/Pace/Net/` and the shared framing
in `src/Pace/Core/`.

Read this before touching `CompileCacheWire`, `WireFrame`/`WireFields`,
`CompileCacheHandler`, `TcpClient`, `BlockingSocket`/`BlockingConnector`, or any
reactor socket implementation.

Every rule below has already been a bug.

## Framing

<!-- agent-tripwire: A frame declares its own length, so a rejection is a **reply** and a resynchronization -->

- **A compile-cache frame declares its own length, so a rejection can be a reply
  instead of a close.** The pre-1 header was `[magic][op]` with no length, and
  that is what made every refusal — bad magic, unknown opcode, oversize field —
  a silent `co_return`: with no declared length the server could not find where
  the frame it was refusing ended, so it could not answer and resynchronize. A
  client cannot tell that apart from a dead connection, so a mismatched install
  presented as a flaky network and a cache that never warmed. The header is now
  `[magic][version][op][u32 payloadLength]` and every reply is
  `[status][u32 payloadLength][payload]` — uniformly, including a miss, which is
  a zero-length payload rather than no payload. `MemcachedBinary` already proved
  the pattern: it can refuse-and-continue precisely because its header declares
  `totalBodyLen`. Consequences that are each load-bearing: `Miss` is distinct
  from `Error` (both were `0x00`, so a rejected client saw an endlessly cold
  cache); an `UnsupportedVersion` message names the supported *range*, since a
  rejection that cannot say what would have worked cannot be acted on; and there
  is deliberately **no handshake**, because the launcher opens a fresh connection
  per *operation* and a HELLO would cost 2–4 round trips per translation unit on
  the exact path this list already records regressions on.
- **On a SEALED connection, a refusal decided from a header whose tag has not been
  read is a sealed reply and then a CLOSE, never a resynchronization** -- the one
  exception to the rule above, and it is not a relaxation of it. That rule's premise
  is that a declared length leaves both ends agreeing where the next frame starts.
  On a sealed stream the tag FOLLOWS the payload, so a header refused before its
  frame is gathered (`SealFault::OverBudget`: the in-flight budget has no room for
  it) carries a length nobody verified. Stepping over that many bytes would let
  whoever wrote the header -- an on-path writer holding no session key -- choose
  the next frame boundary and so the sequence position every later tag is checked
  at, which is exactly what the seal exists to deny ("a proof is worth nothing
  unless every frame after it is SEALED"). So `AnswerSealedOverBudget`
  (`FrameEndpoint.cpp`) writes the verb owner's `EndpointRefusalReply(InFlightBudget)`
  -- the budget owner's when nothing owns the verb, since the verb is as unverified as
  the length -- sealed, and the connection ends: an honest peer still reads *busy* as an unsealed
  one does, for the price of one re-proof. Its case is *"A sealed frame the in-flight
  budget has no room for is answered busy and never held"*. **Do not "fix" this
  close into a resync to match the rule above**: that turns a refusal into a
  frame-boundary oracle for an attacker. Every other seal fault (a bad tag, a
  replay, an oversized or unframed header) closes UNANSWERED, because there the
  frame is not known to be the peer's at all.
- **A reply is one frame per request, and `Status::Progress` is the first of two exceptions --
  bounded to exactly one verb, carrying nothing, and paid for with a version step.** The
  second is `Status::Push`, below, bounded the same way.
  A dispatched compile is bounded by how long a COMPILER runs, so its client's total
  deadline is minutes by construction and was therefore also how long a worker whose
  process had stopped making progress went unnoticed. Keepalive (#247) answers a dead
  HOST and is blind to a kernel that answers every probe while nothing above it does;
  only a periodic *I am still here* separates those, and only the party doing the work
  can send it ([#245](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/245)).
  Four consequences, each load-bearing:
  - **A reply carries a status byte and a length and NO KIND, so the extensibility the
    request framing has does not exist on the way back.** `DecodeReplyHeader` refuses
    an unknown status outright, and the launcher maps that refusal to a transport
    failure -- so a client built before this meets a pulse by abandoning the compile
    several minutes in, naming nothing. `MinSupportedVersion` therefore moved WITH
    `CurrentVersion` to 3: the older request is refused `UnsupportedVersion`, which
    names the range that would have worked and arrives before a byte of source is
    sent, and the capability becomes implied by the version rather than negotiated.
    "The framing already lets a receiver step over what it does not know" is the
    tempting reason not to bump, and it is a fact about REQUESTS.
  - **Which verbs may be answered with it is a column of `OpTable`**, and
    `ProgressIsCompileOnly()` is `static_assert`ed. Every other verb on this wire is
    answered from a table in microseconds, so a pulse on one would be a frame no client
    could observe and a second reply shape every reader would have to handle for
    nothing -- and a mask widened by hand would give it to them by omission.
  - **It says nothing about the work, and `EncodeProgressReply()` takes no argument so
    there is nothing to pass.** Partial diagnostics here would be a second, racy channel
    for output the result frame already carries whole. A receiver still drains the
    declared length rather than asserting it is zero, for the same reason every frame
    here is drained by its declared length.
  - **A reader loops until a TERMINAL status, so one answer per request survives.**
    `IsTerminalStatus` is in the wire header rather than at each reader, because there
    are four of them in this tree -- the launcher's cache and worker exchanges, the
    admin CLI and the protocol test client -- and a reader that does not ask treats the
    first pulse as the answer. Nothing bounds how MANY arrive: a worker that pulses
    forever is alive and never finishing, which is what the exchange's total budget has
    always been for, and a frame count beside it would be two ceilings on one thing
    that could never be converted into each other.
  - **Silence is only measurable against something that would otherwise be said, so the
    worker's cadence and the client's idle bound are ONE pair of numbers in
    `CompileCacheWire` with the RELATION between them `static_assert`ed.**
    `DefaultProgressInterval` is what a worker writes on while a compile runs;
    `DefaultCompileIdleTimeout` is how long the client lets it go quiet. They bound one
    silence from opposite sides, so neither end can retune its own without describing a
    fleet the other end is not running -- and the launcher links none of the library, so
    that header is the only place both can look. An idle bound at or below the cadence
    refuses a healthy worker on the ordinary jitter of its own reactor, which reads as a
    fleet that has stopped working; the assertion is what stops the next retune from
    spelling that. The derivation, with the dead-worker figures it replaced, is in
    [`distributed-compilation.md`](distributed-compilation.md).
  - **A pulse is a SECOND writer on the socket for the length of the answer, so the
    endpoint SETTLES it before it writes anything.** `ServeConnection` is the only writer
    by construction; while the responder answers it writes nothing and the pulse takes
    over, and `SettlePulse` (reached through `ReclaimFromPulse`) is where that stops being
    true. A reply written over a pulse still suspended inside `Write` is two writes sharing
    one write-op slot -- #663's read slot reached from the other direction -- and it does
    not fail loudly, it splices five bytes into an object file. **A pulse still parked past
    the bound ENDS the connection**, which is `SettleWatch`'s rule on the read side applied
    to the write side, and the caller's `break` falling through to `socket->Close()` is the
    only cancellation a parked write has. `Detail::ClaimWriteSlot` names the misuse in a
    Debug build but does not SETTLE anything, so it does not replace `ReclaimFromPulse`.
    - **A test that only watches the answer cannot see any of it.** Reading one framed
      reply stops at the first terminal status, so a pulse emitted AFTER the reply --
      exactly what a missing settle produces -- is invisible, and a case asserting "every
      frame but the last is a pulse" passes VACUOUSLY on a build that pulses none, because
      with one frame the run before the last is empty. So the ordering case reads to EOF,
      requires at least two frames, and keeps a control on a surface that pulses nothing.
- **`Status::Push` is the second exception: a `SUBSCRIBE` is answered by a stream of pushes
  and then exactly one terminal**
  ([#1399](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1399)). `Ok` is an orderly
  end, an `Error` names why the stream was refused or revoked, and a close is the watcher
  having left, reset or stalled. The version moved to 9 at both ends for `Progress`'s reason.
  - **Which verb admits it is the same column**, `static_assert`ed by `PushIsSubscribeOnly`.
    A verb that acquires a push acquires a reader that loops and a writer that outlives the
    request, which is a decision, not something to inherit by widening a mask.
  - **A subscriber is PULLED, never queued.** Every subscriber wakes on its subject's tick
    grid, re-gates, and reads one capture per subject per tick, so rendering costs once per tick
    however many watch. A subscriber whose push parked wakes on the current tick and is told
    once, as a `Gap`, how many whole cadences it missed. A per-subscriber queue was the first
    design. It holds memory for exactly the watcher that is not reading, and its drop policy
    is a second decision about staleness that the tick grid already makes.
  - **No reactor waits on another reactor's capture, and no subscriber waits for a CLAIMED one.**
    The capture is shared by every reactor of a daemon, so it is claimed with an atomic exchange
    and published under a lock held for the pointer copy alone; a lock across the capture stopped
    every other reactor's thread for as long as a storage walk took. And a subscriber that loses
    the claim sends the newest PUBLISHED capture it has not read, labelled and cursored by the tick
    it was captured on. Looking again for the claimed one is the obvious repair, and it STARVES: a
    capture slower than a tick is claimed again the moment it is published, so a subscriber on
    another reactor finds it claimed on every look. A two-reactor case on real threads showed that
    red after the lock was gone; `LiveStream_test` pins it on one clock.
  - **A stream is re-gated EVERY tick, not only when it opens.** Membership, leadership and
    the daemon's credential policy are all asked again, because removal is the direction that
    fails OPEN and nothing reports it. The credential is re-asked on the command loop's own
    rotation terms: a connection that proved a secret keeps its stream when the secret
    rotates, and one that never presented one loses it once a policy requires it.
  - **The push hold is armed from the write's START**, and it is
    `max(MinLiveStreamWriteStall, LiveIdleCadences x granted)`. The client's silence bound is
    `LiveIdleBound(granted)`, the same pair of numbers in `CompileCacheWire`. Armed from the
    previous write's END instead, a parked push is cut up to one cadence early, and a real-socket
    case cannot see a difference that small. The node's before-write arm survives a neuter for
    exactly that reason, and the daemon's sink pins its bound on a manual clock.
  - **A request pipelined behind a subscription ends it in order (`Ok`) and is then served.**
    On the daemon the read watch is not armed when the reader already holds bytes: a watch
    parks on the socket, and bytes already taken off it never wake that watch.
  - **A client leaves by HALF-closing.** The surface counts EOF as the watcher's goodbye. A
    close with pushes still unread in the client's receive queue is an RST on the wire, which
    the surface counts as a reset, the alertable ending.
  - **A stream frame a reactor frees after its owner touches only what it owns.** A stream
    parked on a timer is freed when its reactor is destroyed, and the node declares its reactor
    before the component that serves streams. A subscription place decrementing a counter held
    BY VALUE in that component was a use-after-free at shutdown, found by a neuter whose failing
    case unwound through it. The active count is therefore a `shared_ptr` each frame holds.
- **The wire's two grammars are shared, and both live in `Core/` for the same
  reason.** `Core/WireFields` is the payload — a run of `[u32 length][bytes]` —
  and `Core/WireFrame` is the seven bytes in front of it:
  `[magic][version][kind][u32 payloadLength]`. `CompileCacheWire` and `RaftWire`
  had each spelled the second one out, the encoder character-identical and
  `IsSupported` identical outright, which is the drift `CompileCacheWire`'s own
  documentation warns about applied to the half a reader reaches first. What
  `WireFrame` deliberately does **not** decide is what any of it means: the magic
  is the caller's, so two protocols on two ports stay distinguishable; the kind
  byte comes back raw and is validated against the caller's own table, because a
  receiver has to be able to *step over* a frame whose kind it does not know; and
  the supported version range is a parameter, because the wires version
  independently and always will. `RaftWire::FrameHeader` is an alias of
  `WireFrame::Header` while `CompileCacheWire::RequestHeader` is rebuilt from it —
  not an inconsistency but the cost of a rename: that struct's field is spelled
  `opRaw` at some seventy call sites across the daemon, the launcher and the test
  client, and the thing that had to stop being duplicated was the *layout*.
- **`Protocol/CompileCacheWire.hpp` must stay header-only and dependency-free.**
  Same constraint as `Cli/UsageDoc`, same reason: `pace-cc` does not link
  the `Pace` library, so an include of anything from `Net/`, `Cache/`,
  `Async/` or `Config/` there breaks the launcher's **link**, not merely its
  build. Being header-only is also what keeps it free — it costs no row in
  `_fc_cc_core`. The dependency runs *out* of `ProtocolAutodetect.hpp` (which
  pulls in `Task`, `CacheEngine` and `ISocket`, and so can never be included by a
  client) into the wire header, never the other way. The launcher's own framing
  lives in `apps/pace-cc/CacheProtocol.cpp` rather than `main.cpp` for a
  related reason: `main.cpp` is in no test target, so while the framing sat there
  it had *no* unit coverage at all.
  - **And being dependency-free is what makes it carry cache tiers POSITIONALLY, which
    makes `StorageTier`'s enumerator order a wire contract.** The launcher cannot see the
    enum -- it links nothing of `Cache/` -- so the INDEX is the whole agreement between
    the two ends, and a mid-enum insertion re-attributes every tier a node reports. That
    is the enum-declaration rule below, reached from the header's own constraint rather
    than from a cast; see also
    [`distributed-compilation.md`](distributed-compilation.md).
- **A length a PEER declares sizes nothing until it has been checked against this
  side's own cap — and a codec envelope's `rawLen` is such a length.** The frame
  header's `payloadLength` was checked; the envelope's declared *decompressed*
  size, one layer in, was passed straight to `Compression::Decompress`, which
  **value-initializes** a buffer of exactly that size. So the pages are touched
  rather than lazily reserved, and a `u32` chosen by the sender with no enforced
  relation to the compressed bytes beside it turned a thirty-byte frame into a
  4 GiB allocation. The surface's in-flight byte budget charged only the *frame*
  length, so it passed admission having reserved nothing like what it cost
  ([#241](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/241)).
  - **Both headers already said so, and neither was implemented.**
    `Core/Compression.hpp` states the precondition — `originalLen` is "the trusted
    expected size taken from the record header", which off a socket it is neither —
    and `Protocol/CompileCacheWire.hpp` goes further: carrying `rawLen` "is what
    lets a decoder reject a payload whose declared expansion exceeds its cap before
    decompressing a byte". A guard a header *promises* is not a guard; grep for the
    decoders before believing the comment.
  - **The cap is the SURFACE's, injected rather than assumed.** A decoder does not
    see the listener that enforced the frame length, so a surface with a smaller
    request cap has to say so or the two disagree about what one request may cost.
    `WorkerProtocol` takes it as a constructor argument, the launcher as a
    `DispatchBudgets` field — a byte budget beside the two time budgets, bounding
    the same thing they do. **And the surface has to actually pass it**: the node
    took the decoder's default and left `WorkerServer`'s own request cap as a second
    literal holding the same number, which is precisely the "two must agree forever"
    shape this whole change exists to remove. `WorkerMaxRequestBytes` is exported
    from `WorkerServer.hpp` and handed over at construction, so lowering the surface's
    cap lowers the decoder's.
  - **Both ends of a payload need the guard, so there is ONE decoder**
    (`apps/pace-cc/CodecEnvelope`). The worker opening a request and the launcher
    opening a worker's reply were copies of one function; a guard added to either is
    half a fix, and two guards must then agree forever. The launcher is not the safe
    half: it dialled a worker the *scheduler* named, which is not a worker it trusts
    with its address space.
  - **Sharing that decoder must not cost the payload a copy, and there is no call site
    cheap enough to be the one that pays.** The two callers want different containers
    — a `std::string` a compiler will read, a `std::vector<std::byte>` object file —
    and each spelling that unifies them at the *return type* taxes one of them with a
    full extra allocation and memcpy of a multi-megabyte payload, peak `2N` instead of
    `N`, on the path a developer's build is waiting on. Returning bytes taxes the text
    caller, whose source arrives `Identity` — the only codec a node negotiates — and
    used to be built straight out of the frame. Returning a *generic* container taxes
    the object caller, because `Compression::Decompress` already hands back a
    `vector<std::byte>` sized exactly `rawLength` that can be moved through, and a
    range-constructed generic result copies it. "It is only one call site" is the trap:
    both are the hot one. So the ceiling, the framing check and the `Identity` length
    check — everything two implementations could disagree about — live in one internal
    helper, and `Unenvelope` / `UnenvelopeText` differ only in the container each
    fills, once.
  - **`auto const` on an `expected` silently turns the move back into a copy.**
    `*std::move(x)` on a `const` object is a `T const&&`, which binds to the **copy**
    constructor with no diagnostic at any warning level — a fix that reads as applied
    and is not. The decompressed buffer is held in a non-`const` local for exactly
    this reason.
  - **An envelope refusal's wire code and its message are one fact, so they are one
    table row.** A ternary picking the code beside a separate call picking the text
    answered `unsupported-codec` for a *malformed* envelope while the message said
    "malformed" — a refusal that sends an operator hunting a codec mismatch that never
    happened. This is `RefusalTable`'s rule, one layer in, and it is an `EnumTable`
    guarded by `RowsInEnumeratorOrder` for the same reason that one is.
  - **An `Identity` envelope is checked too.** It takes no decompression path, so it
    never reached `Decompress`'s own length check and could declare any size beside
    any payload. Not an allocation — but a field describing bytes it does not
    describe, and the next receiver to believe it is the next defect.
  - Refusal is `payload-too-large` and a **reply**, never a close: the frame declared
    its own length, so the link is still synchronised and the peer learns which of
    its fields was refused. That is the framing rule at the top of this section,
    applied one layer in.
  - **A per-request ceiling is not a bound on a surface that serves many at once, and
    the guard above is only per request.** `Unenvelope` refuses one envelope declaring
    more than 256 MiB; it says nothing about `slots` of them declaring exactly that.
    The worker's in-flight byte budget was the thing that bounded the surface, and it
    reserved `payloadLength` — the **compressed** frame length — so a hundred-byte
    frame declaring a 256 MiB expansion passed admission having charged a hundred
    bytes. `slots` connections, `slots × 256 MiB` of value-initialized memory: the
    exact shape `MaxInFlightBytes` was introduced to close, reopened one layer in by
    the fix that named the layer. **A ceiling and a budget are different questions,
    and answering the first is not answering the second.**
    - **What a request costs is charged where the budget is, on the accept path**, and
      it is `DeclaredRequestFootprint` — the larger of the frame's own length and what
      its envelope declares it expands to. One counter, one refusal, one `EndpointBusy`:
      a second budget inside the decoder would be two numbers that have to agree about
      one machine's memory, and a job that has to remember to give back two things.
    - **It cannot be charged any earlier, and that is a property of the format.** The
      envelope is a *field of the payload*, so nothing knows the declared expansion
      until the payload — which the frame length already paid for — has been read. The
      reservation is therefore RAISED rather than taken twice: a job holds one amount
      and gives back what it holds.
    - **The larger of the two, not their sum, and the budget bounds the surface at a
      constant multiple of one request rather than byte-exactly.** Byte-exactness was
      never on offer and is not what was lost: by the time the footprint is known, the
      reader's buffer, the payload copy and the assembled frame are already three
      copies of the same bytes. The sum would buy a number that still is not the peak,
      at the price of refusing one honest maximal translation unit on an idle worker —
      which is dividing the per-request cap by the slot count, arrived at from the
      other side. What matters is that the bound grows with `slots` by a figure CHOSEN
      for what a compile holds, never by the per-request ceiling: since #1667 the
      default budget is `slots` times 64 MiB (`WorkerInFlightBytesPerSlot`, a quarter of
      the default per-request ceiling, sized from measured translation units), never
      below 256 MiB nor below the per-request ceiling -- inside the 1 GiB per slot the
      slot clamp already assumes a compile may cost. `slots` times the CEILING is what
      #241 closed and stays closed. An operator names another budget with
      `--compile-inflight-max`, refused at startup below the larger of
      `--compile-request-max` and the listener's 256 MiB frame cap.
    - **A price nothing could ever pay is not charged at all.** A footprint above the
      *whole* budget is the per-request ceiling, which `Unenvelope` answers by name
      with `payload-too-large` and without allocating. Reserved for, it comes back
      `EndpointBusy` on a completely idle worker — "ask again shortly" for a frame no
      amount of waiting will fit, which is a client in a retry loop and an operator
      reading a busy signal from an idle machine. `EndpointBusy` is transient or it is
      the wrong word.
    - Refused as a **reply**, like every other refusal here: the frame declared its
      own length and has been read in full, so the link is synchronised and the peer
      learns that memory — not the fleet, and not a slot — is what it waited for.

- **A number a PEER declares sizes nothing until it has been checked against the bytes
  that are actually there.** A declared count or length is a *claim about bytes the
  frame must already contain* — not a request, and not a size to allocate from. Every
  element costs some fixed minimum in the shared field grammar, so the claim is
  checkable, and `WireFields::DeclaredCountFits` is where that check lives
  ([#267](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/267)). **This is a
  class, not a list of sites** — it has now been found four times, in four unrelated
  formats, and each was written by somebody who knew the rule for the *length* fields
  in the same decoder. `DecodeCompileValue` (~172 GB from a **nine-byte** frame —
  measured, `sizeof(TextRegion)` is 40, and under a 2 GiB address-space cap the
  pre-fix decoder aborts on `std::bad_alloc`), `PrefetchGroupManifest`'s key list,
  `DirectManifest` (~274 GB from thirteen bytes), and `SetCodec` (~137 GB from
  **six**, [#271](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/271)).
  **Grep for `reserve(`, `resize(` and `assign(` in any decoder you touch, and ask of
  each one where its argument came from.**
  - **A value blob is a peer's bytes too, and that is where the worst one hid.**
    `SetCodec::Decode` reads a set *this daemon wrote* — except that what marks a value
    as a set is its `flags` word, and the memcached text verbs let a client choose it.
    So `set evil 1584398337 0 6` carrying `FC 01 FF FF FF FF`, then `SMEMBERS evil`,
    reserved `0xFFFFFFFF` strings from **six** bytes: no privilege, no fleet
    membership, two stock front ends over one engine, and the `std::bad_alloc` escaped
    the RESP handler uncaught. It is the widest-reaching member of the family and the
    least obvious, because nothing about the decoder says "network".
    **"Only we write these bytes" is a claim to check against every protocol the
    engine serves, never an assumption** — and a shared `CacheEngine` means every
    front end is every other front end's writer.
    - **`Cache/StreamCodec` was the same door, on the clamping shape**
      ([#269](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/269), fixed).
      `FcTypeStream` (`0x5E700002`) is the second tag a memcached `set` can choose, and
      its **five** declared counts went through `detail::BoundedReserve` —
      `reserve(min(count, remaining))`, the variant this rule's own header argues
      against, because it keeps a provably malformed blob alive and still commits
      `remaining * sizeof(element)`. It carried a second defect the clamp hid: it
      assumed **one byte per element** for all five, where the format's true minimums
      are 20, 8, 36, 4 and 36 — so forty trailing bytes bought forty reservations where
      the grammar permits two and one. A clamp is not merely a weaker refusal; it
      *disguises* a bound nobody checked. `BoundedReserve` was **deleted, not
      tightened**.
  - **It lives in `Core/WireFields.hpp` beside `FieldPrefixSize`**, which is usually the
    answer to its `minBytesEach`, and which that header already argues must stay
    header-only and dependency-free because `pace-cc` compiles it in *without
    linking `Pace`*. A guard under `CompileCache/` was invisible to `Protocol/`,
    `Cluster/DiscoveryWire` and `Consensus/RaftWire` — the decoders that share this
    grammar and will grow the next declared count.
  - **It refuses; it does not clamp.** `reserve(min(count, cap))` keeps a provably
    malformed frame alive and merely makes its allocation smaller, so the decode fails
    later having already committed memory. `Cache/StreamCodec`'s `BoundedReserve` was
    that weaker shape *and* assumed one byte per element, at all five of its counts
    ([#269](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/269)). Both halves
    mattered: forty trailing bytes bought forty reserved elements where the format can
    hold at most two, and the *entry* minimum is twenty. It is deleted, not tightened
    — a second, weaker mechanism beside the guard is how a decoder ends up reaching for
    the wrong one.
  - **A test that only asserts the refusal does not test this.** All five StreamCodec
    sites returned `false` before the fix too: the clamped reserve happened and *then*
    the loop failed on bytes that were never there. What separates refusing from
    reserving-then-failing is whether the reservation happened, so the case asserts
    `capacity() == 0` on the vectors the caller owns — and it needs trailing bytes to
    do it, because with none the old clamp bounded to zero and looked correct.
  - **The bound is an argument you cannot omit, because remembering it does not scale.**
    Three of these were counts read by hand in a decoder whose author had correctly
    bounds-checked the *length* fields a few lines away — nothing about `ReadU32` says a
    count is different. So `Core/ByteCursor::ReadCount(out, minBytesEach)` obtains a
    count and takes the bound as an argument with no default, which it will never get
    ([#272](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/272)). Same reasoning
    as putting a payload ceiling in the verb table rather than at each consumer.
    **It is not yet the only way to obtain a count, so do not read this as an
    invariant.** `Cache/StreamCodec` and `Cache/SetCodec` go through it; `CompileValue`,
    `PrefetchGroupManifest` and `DirectManifest` still hand-roll a cursor and guard the
    count beside it. Those three carry the guard already, so the remaining conversion is
    a refactor with no security delta and is tracked separately by
    [#304](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/304) — deliberately
    not ridden along with a security fix. Until it lands, a new decoder uses
    `ByteCursor`; an old one is not evidence that hand-rolling is still sanctioned.
  - **A per-element minimum is a security bound, not a sizing hint** — the distinction a
    later caller will get wrong. It must be a true *lower* bound or honest data is
    refused, so it always under-estimates the count for typical data; that is what makes
    it correct, not what makes it improvable. Sizing an allocation from it is the mistake
    it invites, and on `SetCodec` a clamp derived that way *raised* peak memory on real
    input while claiming to bound it. Each minimum is pinned to its own encoder by a test
    that encodes one empty element and subtracts.
  - **Divide, never multiply.** `count <= remaining / minBytesEach`, because
    `count * minBytesEach` is the overflowing spelling and wraps on exactly the values
    the check exists to refuse.
  - **Validating the count is necessary and not sufficient.** It bounds the claim by
    bytes present, which still leaves an amplifier whenever the in-memory element is
    bigger than its wire minimum. So a reservation is sized from something this side
    OWNS — the bytes in hand (`remaining / sizeof(Element)`) or its own configured cap
    (`MaxKeysPerGroup`) — never from the peer's number alone. Dropping the reserve
    entirely is the third option and is right only where the count is small anyway.
  - **The per-element minimum is pinned to the ENCODER by a test**, not by a comment
    asking the next author to remember: encode one empty element, subtract, compare.
    A field added to the encoder then fails a test instead of silently weakening the
    guard.
  - **A decoder that cannot say "refused" will be misread by one of its callers.**
    `DecodeKeyList` returned a plain vector, so an empty one meant both "no keys" and
    "these bytes are not a manifest" — harmless on the read path and destructive on the
    write path, where `AddKey` would have replaced a hundred-thousand-key group with a
    one-key list on the strength of bytes it had just failed to understand. It returns
    `optional` now, and both callers answer `Corrupt`.

- **An enum whose ordinals are transmitted or persisted says so at its declaration; one
  whose ordinals are private says that too, because "no comment" means both.** Inserting an
  enumerator mid-enum shifts every later ordinal, and whether that is free or catastrophic
  depends entirely on whether anything outside this process reads those numbers. This tree
  holds both kinds and, until #308, nothing at either declaration said which. The session
  working #275 checked deliberately before inserting into `IMetricsSink::Counter` and was
  right; the point is that the check was **available to be skipped**, and skipping it shows
  up in no test. A mid-enum insertion in a persisted enum does not fail to load — every
  record already written comes back with each field attributed to the NEXT enumerator,
  silently, for as long as the file exists.

  The census is a PATTERN and not a number: every `static_cast<T>(...)` in `src/` whose `T`
  is an enum, that being where an ordinal ARRIVES from bytes somebody else wrote, plus the
  carriers that are a POSITION rather than a decoded byte and the decoders that spell the
  enum as a template parameter. 18 enums, and the split is the finding:

  <!-- table-total: enums=rows -->
  | enum | what reads the ordinal | stated at the declaration before #308 |
  |---|---|---|
  | `PathCanon::Grammar` | a stored `CompileValue`'s region tag byte | **no** |
  | `CowTree::PageType` | the page header's type byte, on disk | **no** |
  | `CowTree::MetaSlot` | a meta page's FILE OFFSET, `slot * pageSize` | **no** |
  | `Distributed::FleetMetric` | a history body, positionally | **no** |
  | `IMetricsSink::Counter` | nothing outside the process — an array index | **no** |
  | `Consensus::EntryKind` | a log record's kind byte, on disk AND on the peer wire | **no** |
  | `Consensus::VoteDecision` | a vote response's byte | **no** |
  | `Consensus::AppendResult` | an append response's byte | **no** |
  | `StorageTier` | `CompileCacheWire`, positionally | the INDEX, not the wire |
  | `DiscoveryWire::Kind` | the datagram's kind byte | implied by the file, not said |
  | `MemcachedBinary::Opcode` | the memcached spec's byte | implied by the values, not said |
  | `Cc::KeyPiece` | folded into the launcher's key digest | implied by the values, not said |
  | `Cluster::CommandKind` | a replicated command's byte | yes |
  | `CompressionCodec` | the stored codec id | yes |
  | `RaftWire::MessageType` | the third peer-frame header byte | yes |
  | `CompileCacheWire::Op` | the third request-header byte | yes |
  | `CompileCacheWire::Status` | the reply's first byte | yes |
  | `CompileCacheWire::ErrorCode` | an `Error` payload's first byte | yes |

  Eight silent. `Grammar` is the one that justifies the ticket: its ordinal is the grammar
  tag of every region of every object this cache has ever stored, every enumerator was
  implicit, and a mid-enum insertion would have the canonicalizer rewrite a `/showIncludes`
  region under GCC depfile rules — #229's failure, on a green build with no counter moving.
  `EntryKind` is the one that is both PERSISTED and TRANSMITTED: insert a kind, raise
  `WireEnumBound<EntryKind>::Highest`, and the build is green while every `Configuration`
  entry already in `raft.log` comes back one kind along — a committed membership change
  ordered, committed and never adopted.

  **The pattern is narrower than its author reads it, in the direction that matters, and
  it was narrower than THIS ticket's author read it too.** Three ways an enum escapes the
  cast census, all of them found by reading rather than by grepping:

  - **An encode-side table walk.** `CompileCacheWire::Op` is decoded by `FindOp`, which
    walks `OpTable` comparing `static_cast<std::uint8_t>(row.code) == opRaw` — an ENCODE of
    each row. `RaftWire::MessageType` and `FindMessage` are the same shape.
  - **A position, which is no cast at all.** `StorageTier` and `FleetMetric` are indexed
    into, and `MetaSlot` is MULTIPLIED into a file offset — the ordinal never becomes a
    byte anybody decodes, and it still names where two meta pages live in every store.
  - **A cast whose enum is a template parameter.** `Consensus::DecodeWireEnum<E>` ends in
    `static_cast<E>(raw)`, so a grep for `static_cast<SomeEnum>` finds ONE hit spelled `E`
    for THREE wire enums at once. `Cc::KeyPiece` escapes on the same edge from the other
    side: it is folded into a digest and decoded nowhere, so there is no cast to find.

  Nine of eighteen rows sit outside the pattern — exactly half — and the first pass of this
  ticket found only three of the nine, shipping a table whose `table-total` marker made 12
  read as complete coverage. **A census states its PATTERN, not only its number**, and here
  the number was checked against the table while the pattern was not checked against the
  tree. A scan derived from the cast alone would report a clean set while the enum whose
  order is most load-bearing sat outside it.

  **The explicit `= N` is the enforcement; the comment is the rule.** On a persisted or
  transmitted enum every enumerator carries its value, so a renumbering appears in review as
  a changed literal on every row below the insertion rather than as an invisible consequence
  of one added line. `Last` carries one too where it exists — `readability-enum-initial-value`
  accepts all, none or only-the-first, and this tree does not silence clang-tidy — and it
  earns it: forgetting to bump `Last` while adding a slot makes the new enumerator COLLIDE
  with it, which shortens `EnumeratorCount` and fails `RowsInEnumeratorOrder`'s
  `static_assert` against the table. **On a PRIVATE enum the same edit is harmful**: a column
  of explicit ordinals asserts a contract that does not exist, and the next person to add a
  counter preserves it. `IMetricsSink::Counter` therefore keeps `ConnectionsTotal = 0` and
  nothing else, which is the same lint's only-the-first form.

  What actually catches an omission differs per enum and is worth knowing before relying on
  one: `RowsInEnumeratorOrder` for the two `EnumTable` carriers, the exhaustive `switch` in
  `IsKnownGrammar` for `Grammar` (an added enumerator is a `-Werror` warning at the one place
  that decides whether a tag is legal), `WireEnumBound`'s undefined primary template for the
  three Raft enums (an enum that forgets its bound is a compile error at the decode site),
  and **nothing at all for `PageType`, `MetaSlot` or `KeyPiece`** — `PageType`'s decoder
  refuses a byte that is neither value, which a SWAP of two live values passes perfectly,
  and the other two are never decoded at all. The comment is the whole guard there.

  **And none of those is a guard against THIS hazard, though the first one reads like one.**
  `RowsInEnumeratorOrder` checks that `table[i]` describes enumerator `i`, so it fires on a row
  omitted, a row misplaced, and a `Last` that was not bumped -- every edit leaving the TABLE
  inconsistent with the enum. A mid-enum insertion **with its row inserted at the matching
  position** leaves the two perfectly consistent: the `static_assert` passes, the build is
  green, and every record already written now decodes shifted. So the two enums carrying an
  `EnumTable` are precisely the ones most likely to be read as already protected, and the `= N`
  literals are all that stands between them and this. The same shape one level down:
  `IsKnownGrammar`'s exhaustive `switch` catches an enumerator ADDED and is silent about two
  REORDERED, since both arms still exist. **A guard answering the neighbouring question is
  worse than no guard wherever somebody counts it as this one** -- which happened during this
  change's own review, where the `EnumTable` static_asserts were offered as evidence that the
  explicit values add nothing.

  **Nothing checks the comments themselves, and an approximate scan would be worse than the
  rule.** Deciding "this enum's ordinal is read from bytes somebody else wrote" needs the two
  facts a grep cannot hold together — that a cast crosses a boundary, and that a positional
  layout is one — so a checker built on the cast pattern would refuse correct declarations
  and pass the three rows above that carry no cast. So this rule is all there is, and it gets
  a tripwire bullet in `AGENT.md` rather than a `ctest` name.

## Authentication on the compile-cache port

<!-- agent-tripwire: Which verbs are reachable before authentication is a *column of the table*, and the gate runs before the payload is buffered -->

- **Every protocol checks the configured credential, and the compile cache was the
  one that did not.** `session.CurrentAuth()` was consulted by `MemcachedText`,
  `MemcachedBinary` and `RedisResp` — and by nothing in `CompileCacheHandler`. So a
  daemon started with `--requirepass` gated three protocols and served the `0xFC` port
  to anyone who could open a socket, with no flag, log line or doc saying so. On its own
  that is a cache-poisoning surface; it becomes remote code execution the moment that
  port carries anything that *runs* a compiler, which is why it is closed before any
  distribution work rather than after. Consequences that are each load-bearing:
  **which verbs are reachable before a credential is a column of `OpTable`**
  (`OpDescriptor::preAuth`), not a predicate with its own `switch` — it is the
  security-relevant property of the whole verb set, so a reviewer must read it off the
  table, a verb added without a thought about it defaults to closed, and an opcode the
  table does not know is refused rather than waved through. The **gate runs before the
  payload is buffered** and drains with `Skip`, exactly as `MemcachedBinary`'s does:
  checking afterwards would let an unauthenticated peer pipeline frames each declaring
  `maxPayloadBytes` (256 MiB by default) and force that allocation per frame — a
  memory-exhaustion hole opened by the check meant to close a hole. And the
  per-connection state records **only what was verified**, never "is this connection
  allowed through": seeding a flag from the policy at connect time is the obvious
  spelling and is wrong in both directions — a connection opened while auth was off
  stays exempt for life across a `SIGHUP` that turns auth *on*, and nothing then
  distinguishes "auth is off" from "this peer proved something", so enabling auth later
  silently blesses every open connection. Rotation is the deliberate exception the other
  way: a peer that proved the credential current when it connected keeps access when the
  secret changes under it, as redis does, because re-gating on rotation fails every
  in-flight build at the moment an operator rotates.
  - **The gate has exactly one door held open, and that door needs its own lock.**
    `Op::Auth` is `preAuth` by construction, so its payload is read while the peer has
    proved nothing — bounded only by `session.maxPayloadBytes`, i.e. the whole 256 MiB
    the gate exists to deny, reached through the gate. `OpDescriptor::maxPayload` is
    therefore a second column (`MaxAuthPayload`, 4 KiB, for AUTH; `0` = "the session
    cap" for STORE and FETCH, which carry object files and are read only after
    authentication), and `PreAuthVerbsAreBounded()` is `static_assert`ed so a future
    pre-auth verb cannot reopen the hole by omission rather than by decision. The
    refusal names the verb whose ceiling it hit, because "exceeds cap 268435456" tells
    an operator nothing about a 4 KiB limit.
  - **A REPLY is read from a stranger too, so it has the mirror column.** A client that
    dials a seed a DNS answer named -- or anything answering at that address -- reads from
    a peer that proved nothing, and a reply header declares its length in a `u32`: sized
    by it before a byte arrives, five bytes committed 512 MiB in a fleet probe (measured,
    16 -> 526 MiB peak working set), and 200000 `Progress` pulses on a verb that never
    pulses were waited through. So every `OpTable` row states `maxReply` (`ReplyCap`, whose
    default constructor is deleted as `PayloadCap`'s is), `PreAuthRepliesAreBounded()` and
    `BoundedRepliesHoldARefusal()` are `static_assert`ed, and `Cc`'s ONE reply reader asks
    the verb it SENT -- read off its own frame -- before it allocates: a status the verb's
    EXISTING `legalStatuses` column does not admit, and a declared length over `maxReply`,
    end the exchange as a transport failure. `ReplyCarriesArtefact` is for FETCH and COMPILE
    alone. And a probe of a stranger is bounded by ONE deadline over connect and exchange on
    the injected clock (`Transport/TotalDeadlineSocket`, every read re-armed to the time
    left) -- never by the per-call `SO_RCVTIMEO` a dribbling peer outlasts one byte at a time.
  - **Adding a verb must not break the fleet that does not have it, and that is a
    property of the CLIENT.** `Op::Auth` deliberately did not bump `CurrentVersion` —
    the framing exists so a receiver steps over a verb it does not know — so a daemon
    predating this change answers AUTH `unknown-opcode`, skips it, and serves the
    pipelined command correctly. Returning that refusal as the exchange's outcome, which
    is what a plain "any error is the answer" client does, gives a token-configured
    launcher a permanent **0% hit rate** against every not-yet-upgraded daemon, reported
    as `rejected (unknown-opcode)`: a plausible-looking message with no obvious cause,
    and the exact mixed-fleet case the wire's extensibility was built for. So
    `unknown-opcode` **on AUTH specifically** falls through to the command's own reply;
    every other refusal is about the credential and is still reported. It is not
    silent, though — `CacheOutcome::credentialIgnored` surfaces one note per build,
    because the operator asked for authentication and did not get it, and "the cache
    quietly did less than you told it to" is the failure mode this list exists for.
  - **It costs no round trip, and that is a property of how the client sends rather
    than of the wire.** Authentication is per-connection state and the launcher opens a
    fresh connection per *operation*, so AUTH-then-await-then-command would double the
    round trips of every translation unit — the exact cost the "no handshake" decision
    below exists to avoid. Replies are strictly ordered and one-per-request, so the
    launcher **pipelines**: both frames go out before either reply is read. They are two
    `SendAll` calls, not one concatenated buffer — equally pipelined, since neither waits
    for a reply, but concatenating means copying a STORE frame that carries a whole
    object file, raising peak footprint from about twice the object to three times it on
    the hot path of a parallel build, to buy nothing. The test therefore asserts the
    *write/read interleaving* (`"SSR"`, never `"SRSR"`) rather than a write count: a
    count of one would state the copy instead of the property, and the bytes are
    identical either way so the outcome alone cannot tell the two apart. The client must
    still consume the AUTH reply even when it intends to ignore it; skipping it strands a
    frame and the next command reads the previous one's answer.

- **The code an endpoint refuses an unimplemented verb with is a wire contract, and
  the only tolerated one is `UnknownOpcode`.** `Cc::CacheProtocol::Exchange` steps
  over exactly that code and proceeds unauthenticated — correct against a surface
  with no credential to check — and treats every *other* refusal as being about the
  credential, returning it in place of the answer to the request the caller actually
  sent. So a surface that answers AUTH with `DispatchNotPermitted` gives every
  `PACE_TOKEN`-configured launcher a permanent 0% hit rate, reported as
  `rejected`, which is indistinguishable from a cache that is merely cold. The
  launcher's own comment had already recorded this for the *daemon* — a
  pre-AUTH `pace-kv` answers `unknown-opcode` and serves the pipelined command
  perfectly well, which is the mixed-fleet case the framing's extensibility exists
  for — and the node then reintroduced it on three surfaces by picking a code that
  reads as more accurate. It is not more accurate; it is a different sentence to a
  reader that only parses one. `DispatchNotPermitted` says *this endpoint does not
  do that job*, which is a routing fact a client acts on; `UnknownOpcode` says *I do
  not implement this verb*, which is what an absent capability is. The correction
  belongs in a small `(op, code, why)` table consulted before the generic refusal —
  the shape `CacheProxy::RefusedVerbs` and `CompileCacheHandler::RelocatedVerbs`
  both have — never a special case in the `switch`, because the moment there are two
  answers the next verb must *state* which it is instead of inheriting whichever the
  catch-all happens to give. Three surfaces answering this question in three
  hand-written ways is how they drifted apart to begin with.

  **A new verb is not one dispatch, and none of the other four places fails the BUILD.**
  Measured on `Op::ExplainAdmission` (#1471), which the node's responder served correctly
  while four separate checks went red:

  - **An arm in `CompileCacheHandler`'s `switch`.** A missing one does not fail the build --
    MSVC's C4062 is off by default -- and what it produces is a **dropped frame** rather than
    a refusal: the client waits, times out, and reports a dead endpoint for a daemon that is
    working perfectly. `Every op in the table is dispatched` is what catches it, and the tell
    is that the symptom names the wrong subject.
  - **A `RelocatedVerbs` row**, saying which code and which sentence. `DispatchNotPermitted`
    for a verb another binary serves; `NoCluster` only for one asking about replicated state.
    A refusal DERIVED from data that already names the verb is that row's equivalent, not a
    special case: `CacheProxy` refuses a verb another cache tier's `CacheTierProfile` serves as
    `DispatchNotPermitted`, computed from the profiles, because a row per verb would restate them.
    Admission is a property of the PROCESS being asked, so a client told `NoCluster` goes
    looking for consensus it does not need. The generic walk only asserts the refusal is not
    `UnknownOpcode`, so the case that asserts WHICH refusal is a second one.
  - **A documentation row for any counter the verb adds**, because the node's page is
    compared against `RenderPrometheus` rather than against `MetricsCatalog`. That check is a
    Catch2 source walk, so **grepping `docs/` and `scripts/` for a counter list answers that
    no such check exists** -- which is what happened here.
  - **The live-stats layout pin**, which moves whenever a catalogue row does, with the reason
    recorded beside the earlier moves. Clients and nodes upgrade together.

  - **A transmitted BITMASK is a namespace of `constexpr std::uint32_t`, never an
    `enum class`** -- `NodeComponentBit` is the precedent, and `WireMembershipRoute` missed it
    and was corrected by CI. A bitmask is not an enumeration: the values combine, so no
    variable of the type ever holds one of them and a `switch` over it means nothing.
    `performance-enum-size` is what says so, on every TU including the header, and the
    tempting fix is wrong twice: narrowing the base type caps a set the WIRE has room to grow,
    and makes the type's width disagree with the field's. The namespace keeps every call
    site's spelling and leaves no enum to be the wrong size.

  And a sixth thing, which is not a place but a consequence: **a sentence already on the page
  can stop being true.** The node's payload-too-large row said its operator verbs are *both
  fieldless, so this came from no client of this tree at any version* -- true of `node-status`
  and `node-metrics`, false the moment `VerbFamily::Node` gained a third op carrying a host.
  The conclusion survived and the reason changed. Nothing checks a reason.

  **The code itself is ONE named constant -- `Wire::UnimplementedVerb` -- that every
  surface's table and the client's tolerance spell.** #283 fixed the cache tier
  because that is what its acceptance named; the scheduler and compile ports kept
  answering `DispatchNotPermitted` for another two weeks, so a `PACE_TOKEN`
  client had every `LEASE` declined behind a green build and a `--requirepass` worker
  never joined the fleet at all (#340). Three tables each naming
  `ErrorCode::UnknownOpcode` would have fixed those two and left the *next* surface
  free to drift again; a constant in `CompileCacheWire.hpp` -- the one header the
  launcher compiles in and the library also uses -- makes every party spell one name,
  which is the strongest form available given they link nothing in common. The struct
  and the lookup are shared for the same reason: four hand-written copies of
  `(op, code, why)` is the answer to "if a sixth case showed up tomorrow, how many
  places would I edit".

  **And a row for a verb the surface DOES serve is dead, so it is `static_assert`ed that
  one cannot be added.** The table is consulted only on the path a verb this surface does
  NOT serve takes, so such a row is never read: it sits there looking like a decision and
  changes nothing, which is worse than absent because the next reader counts it as one.
  `SchedulerProtocol.cpp` refuses it at compile time --
  `none_of(RefusedVerbs, IsSchedulerVerb, &Wire::RefusedVerb::op)` -- which is
  `RowsInEnumeratorOrder`'s argument one layer over: a guard that can only fire when the
  table is wrong. That scheduler's own table is now EMPTY and was kept rather than deleted,
  because `AUTH` terminates in `FrameServer`'s loop there, and because the next verb this
  surface refuses must be a ROW rather than a `case`.

  **A wire constant has TWO facts -- its name and its value -- and a symbol shared by
  both ends can only test the first.** This is the trap that "one name every party
  spells" *creates* while closing the drift it was written for, and it is worse than
  what it fixes because it looks green from inside the tree: change the alias
  consistently, and every in-tree assertion still agrees while **every deployed
  launcher breaks**, because the binaries in the field tolerate `0x02` and nothing
  else. Nobody in this repository can recompile the other end of this wire.

  So something must pin the **number**: `static_assert` on the byte, plus at least one
  test asserting the raw enumerator. Those are not redundancy with the shared-name
  assertions -- the raw one is the *anchor*, and the shared-name ones are tautologies
  under a consistent change. Discovered by flipping the alias and **counting** what
  went red: three of five stayed green, including the behavioural contract tests,
  because both ends name the constant. A reviewer read the raw-enumerator assertion as
  the weak one and it was the only one that could fail; the instinct that a literal is
  a code smell is usually right and was exactly wrong here.

  **Its mirror: a RETIRED value keeps its number, and the number is never given to
  anything else.** A peer built before the retirement still maps the byte to its old
  name, so a new meaning under it is reported by that peer as the old one -- the single
  worst way for a value to be wrong. Each retired set is a table beside its live one,
  checked against it at compile time (`NoRetiredErrorCodeIsReused` and its siblings),
  never a comment:

  <!-- table-total: none -->
  | Space | Retired | Was | Table |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `ErrorCode` | `0x06`, `0x24` | canonicalization-failed (#59, #69); enrollment-already-collected (#178) | `RetiredErrorCodes` |
  | `Op` | `0x16`, `0x17` | `CLUSTER-ADMIT-CLIENT`, `CLUSTER-FORGET-CLIENT` (#1309) | `RetiredOpcodes` |
  | `EnrollmentDecision` | `0x03` | `Collected`, the key hand-over #178 retired with the secret | `RetiredEnrollmentDecisions` |
  | `WireMembershipRoute` | `0x01`, `0x02`, `0x04` | the address routes: a listed host, the cluster's member hosts, a forgotten host | `RetiredWireMembershipRoutes` |
  | `Cluster::CommandKind` | `3`, `4` | `AdmitClient`, `ForgetClient`, refused by name when replayed (`RetiredVerbRefusal`) | the `Retired*` enumerators |
  | `MembershipParticipant` | `0` | reserved rather than retired: a zero route bit is no route | `MembershipParticipant::Reserved` |

  A retired OPCODE is an unknown one to every surface -- `FindOp` answers nullptr and it is
  refused `UnknownOpcode` -- while a retired `CommandKind` in a node's OWN log refuses the
  start by name (#1542's `CanRead`), because a log is a record this node must be able to
  replay and a frame is not.

  **And the test for it is a behavioural one, not "the code changed".** Asserting the
  enumerator passes the moment somebody edits a constant. What regresses the defect is
  a credentialled client reaching a surface that does not implement `AUTH` and *still
  getting its request answered* -- driven by the bytes the real server produces, so the
  two ends have to actually agree. `AuthRefusalContract_test` does that for the
  scheduler (the node's test target is the only one holding both parties) and
  `WorkerProtocol_test` for the compile port.

## The Net boundary

<!-- agent-tripwire: The coroutines, the event loop, the sockets and TLS are core-cpp's `core::async`, `core::net` and `core::net_tls` -->

- **The lift this section prepared for has happened.** `Net/` and `Async/` were kept free of
  `Core/` -- a table of allowed edges and `ctest -R net-boundary` -- so they could leave this tree,
  and they did: they are core-cpp's `core::net` and `core::async` since
  [#1596](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1596), with TLS as `core::net_tls`
  and the three leaf headers the table let travel (`Clock`, `Ranges`, `Profiling`) as core-cpp's
  `core::platform` clock and `core::` base headers. The check went with them, because the
  boundary is now a CMake target edge: pace-kv's code cannot reach into core-cpp's internals
  except through its installed headers, and core-cpp's own module table refuses an include across
  its modules that it does not list.
- **What is left here is what core-cpp does not offer yet, in `Transport/`, and a defect in the
  moved code is fixed in core-cpp and re-pinned, never patched around here.** `NativeListen` (a
  port several loops share, an inherited descriptor adopted, and the admin endpoints'
  `BlockingListener`) and `LingeringClose` are each a graduation candidate; the pull request that
  moved the rest names them.

## Sockets

<!-- agent-tripwire: There is exactly one TCP client, `core::net::TcpClient`. Do not write a second -->

- **Three implementations of one TCP client, and the rot was in the one nobody
  built.** `Net/BlockingConnector` dialled non-blocking through `getaddrinfo` and
  was coroutine-aware; `pace-cc` carried a synchronous `Cc::ITcpClient` with
  its own `SetIoTimeouts` copied from `Net/BlockingSocket` and a comment saying it
  could not be shared; and `compile-cache-testclient` carried a hand-written class
  that was `inet_pton(AF_INET)`-only (so a hostname could never work), unbounded,
  unprotected against SIGPIPE while STOREing whole object files, and **did not
  compile on POSIX at all** (issue #84). The third was invisible because
  `PACE_BUILD_TESTCLIENT` defaults OFF and no job turned it on, so nothing
  ever discovered that two of its methods named functions that did not exist
  there. `Net/TcpClient` is now the only one. Consequences that are each
  load-bearing:
  - **`Net` must not depend on `Core`, so `ConnectTcp` takes host and port
    separately.** `Net` is meant to be liftable out of this codebase, so it does
    not reach into `Core/HostPort` for a grammar its caller can apply first —
    which also keeps the one parser one parser, since `rfind(':')` picks the wrong
    colon in `[::1]:7000`. The join lives one layer up in `Cc::DialEndpoint`,
    because six call sites across the launcher and the node were otherwise about
    to write it out separately. It refuses a **bare port**, which
    `ParseEndpoint` would accept by supplying a default host: that is right for a
    bind address an operator types and wrong for a dial, where text with no host
    is a misconfiguration and quietly trying loopback turns a typo into a
    connection to whatever happens to be listening locally.
  - **The partial-transfer loops are coroutines because `ISocket::Read`/`Write`
    are awaitables, and synchronous callers drive them with `SyncRun`.** That is
    sound over a blocking socket and nowhere else: such a socket resolves every
    awaitable inline, so the task is never left suspended, which is the one thing
    `SyncRun` refuses to read from. `RaftPeerTransport` already relied on exactly
    this. Over a *reactor* socket the awaitable really does suspend and `SyncRun`
    throws — the defect `cluster-e2e` found the first time consensus was run.
  - **`IConnector::Connect` grew an `ioTimeout`, with no default argument.** A
    dial that succeeds says the peer accepted and nothing about whether it will
    ever answer, and a peer that accepts and then goes quiet parks the calling
    thread forever — which for the launcher turns an optional cache into a
    build-stopping dependency. Bounding it has to happen before the first read, so
    it belongs where the socket is minted rather than in a step every caller has to
    remember. No default, because a default argument on a virtual binds statically
    and would silently differ between a call through the base and one through the
    derived type.
  - **The launcher still does not LINK `Pace`, and that rule survived
    intact.** The four `Net` rows added to `_fc_cc_core` reach only
    `Net/NetError.hpp`, `Async/Task.hpp` and `Core/Profiling.hpp`, all
    header-only and all std-only, so the launcher stays free of yaml-cpp, OpenSSL
    and the reactor and can still link the CRT statically.
  - **The lookup returns the row by value rather than an iterator**, because no
    spelling of `auto` is portable over a `std::array`'s iterator. That is a
    toolchain fact rather than a wire one and it lives in
    [`.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md`](build-and-toolchain.md); what belongs
    here is only that it was found by building Windows immediately after Linux
    rather than in CI a phase later, the same ordering the `ParsePort` entry above
    exists to argue for.

- **A daemon that ignores SIGPIPE process-wide hands that decision to every
  program it launches.** `Detail::EnsureNetworkInitialised` did
  `::signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)` the first time anything touched the network, which
  keeps a broken-pipe write from killing a server and is wrong for any process that
  also spawns a child: an ignored disposition is **inherited across exec**.
  `pace-node` links this library, listens on a socket and then runs a
  compiler per job, so it was handing every one of those compilers a disposition
  they never asked for — which is precisely what `pace-cc` is documented
  as having to avoid, for the same reason, reached by a different route. Nothing
  in the parent misbehaves, which is why it went unnoticed. Suppression is
  per socket now (`Detail::ArmNoSigPipe`: `SO_NOSIGPIPE` on macOS and the BSDs,
  `MSG_NOSIGNAL` per send elsewhere, process-wide only where neither exists),
  applied at each implementation's single construction funnel. Two things worth
  keeping:
  - **Removing a process-wide safety net exposes every raw sender that was
    leaning on it, and they had to be found by grep rather than by test.**
    `EpollSocket` already passed `MSG_NOSIGNAL` on all three of its sends;
    `KqueueSocket` passed `0` on all three and so needed its descriptor armed;
    `HealthProbe` owns a bare socket and needed the same. `Stats.cpp` writes a
    regular file and the reactors' self-pipes are internal, reachable only through
    a lifetime bug a stray write would already be.
  - **Both regression cases were verified by reintroducing the defect.** Removing
    the send flag terminates the test binary with **signal 13**, exactly as issue
    #68 records for the launcher; restoring the process-wide ignore fails the
    disposition assertion instead. A regression test for a fatal signal that
    cannot be seen to fail is worth nothing.

- **Keepalive is armed per DIAL, and `ApplyHotSocketOptions` is the wrong home for
  it precisely because every socket passes through there.** That function is where
  TCP_NODELAY and the buffer sizes live, and it is reached by every accepted and
  every dialled socket on all four backends — so arming keepalive in it would change
  when an idle memcached or Redis client connection is dropped, and when a Raft peer
  link is torn down, fleet-wide, for a change nobody asked for. Same rule as SIGPIPE
  above, reached from the option side rather than the signal side: per socket, never
  process-wide. `DialOptions::keepAlive` says so at the call, `Detail::ArmKeepAlive`
  applies it, and `SocketAddress_test` asserts the socket is **still not probing**
  after `ApplyHotSocketOptions` — the negative half, which is the assertion that
  fails when somebody later folds the two together for tidiness
  ([#247](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/247)). Four things
  come with it:
  - **Bare `SO_KEEPALIVE` is worth nothing.** Without the intervals it inherits the
    system default — two hours on Linux — which is longer than any deadline it would
    be protecting, while reading back as armed to anything that checks the flag. The
    intervals go on FIRST and the flag last, so a socket that would not take them is
    never left looking protected.
  - **A parameter that cannot be applied is not taken.** Windows sets idle and
    interval through `SIO_KEEPALIVE_VALS` and fixes the probe count at 10 with no way
    to change it, so detection is ~30 s there against ~16 s on Linux and macOS. Both
    are under the bar the values were chosen for; the asymmetry is stated in
    `KeepAliveSettings` rather than papered over by accepting a count and dropping it.
  - **It answers "is this connection dead", never "is this peer working".** A worker
    that is alive and simply not writing is `Status::Progress` (#245), and keepalive
    does not retire it. Collapsing the two is how a slow peer gets killed and a dead
    one gets waited on.
  - **A per-call option must stay per-call.** Fixing it on the connector would be
    per-socket today only by accident of `Cc::RunOneExchange` building one connector
    per exchange, and would become per-many-sockets, silently, the first time anyone
    reused one. `IConnector.hpp` records a post-connect timeout being moved OUT of the
    per-call surface, which reads like a precedent for the opposite — it is not: the
    reason given there is that `SO_RCVTIMEO` is meaningless to a socket whose reads
    suspend, so it belonged to the blocking connector ALONE. That is a fact about
    *which connector*, not about per-call versus construction.

- **A faster failure nobody can name is not an improvement.** Expiry CLOSES the
  socket, so "this side gave up" and "the peer went away" reach the caller as the same
  broken socket — and `Dispatch` folded them, with `Unreachable`, into one sentence
  because the ACTION is the same (compile locally). The same action is not the same
  diagnosis: "that machine is off" and "that compile took longer than the budget" are
  fixed in different places by different people. So `SocketDeadlineTarget` records
  that the timer fired, `Cc::TransportFailure` names the three states — `Unreached`,
  `PeerLost`, `Expired` — and the cause is asked of the TIMER, never inferred from
  elapsed time. Without it, keepalive turns a five-minute non-answer into a
  sixteen-second one that reads identically, and the only visible effect is that
  builds got faster for no stated reason.

- **The same process hands those children its SOCKETS, and neither platform stops
  it.** A compiler that inherits a client connection holds it open for as long as it
  runs, so the client's peer sees a socket that will not finish closing -- and on a
  node serving `slots` compiles at once, an arriving connection is inherited by every
  compiler spawned while it is open. Three beliefs kept this invisible:
  - `SOCK_CLOEXEC` covers the accept path — it covers the *epoll and kqueue* accept
    paths. `BlockingListener::Accept` uses a plain `::accept()` on both platforms,
    and that is the listener the worker port runs on.
  - Windows has no per-descriptor close-on-exec — it has `HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT`, and
    `ArmCloseOnExec` was written as a no-op saying so.
  - A Windows socket is not inheritable unless asked for — it arrives **inheritable**;
    `IocpConnector` passes `WSA_FLAG_NO_HANDLE_INHERIT` for exactly that reason, and
    that lone correct site is what the rest drifted from.

  It is armed in `ApplyHotSocketOptions`, which every socket this process owns passes
  through — accepted and dialled, on all four backends — because a rule that has
  already been forgotten at three sites does not get a fourth chance. The test
  asserts the platform default as well as the result: without the *before* half it
  would pass on a platform where the call did nothing.

- **Naming what a child may inherit beats marking what it may not.** The launcher's
  own spawn does the other half: `CreateProcess` with `bInheritHandles = TRUE` hands
  over every inheritable handle in the process, so a sibling's compiler held another
  job's pipe write-end and that job's drain never saw EOF. Windows passes an explicit
  `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST` rather than chasing handles one at a time,
  which also closes whatever the next inheritable handle turns out to be. POSIX has
  no equivalent, so both pipe ends are marked close-on-exec under a lock that also
  covers the spawn — the window between creating a descriptor and marking it is a
  window a sibling can spawn in, and `pipe2` does not exist on macOS.

- **A listening socket claims its address, and the option that says so is spelled
  differently on each platform.** `Detail::BindAndListen` set `SO_REUSEADDR`
  unconditionally, commented "so restart-after-crash rebinds without TIME_WAIT
  delay" -- POSIX reasoning about an option that does not mean the same thing on
  Windows. On POSIX it only lets a bind step over a `TIME_WAIT` left by a **dead**
  socket, and a live listener still holds its address alone; on Windows it lets a
  second socket bind an address a **live** socket already holds, which is the
  documented reason `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` exists. So on Windows any process on the
  box -- unprivileged -- could bind the port `pace-kv`, a compile node, or
  either one's admin endpoint was already serving, with which of the two answered a
  given connection undefined: for a compile cache reached without a credential that
  is object injection into everybody's build, and for `/metrics` it is a scrape
  surface an attacker can answer (issue #85). It is `ExclusiveBindOption` now --
  one intent, each platform's own spelling. Four things worth keeping:
  - **The `TIME_WAIT` concern the old comment raised is not what was traded away.**
    Measured on Windows 11, across processes: a fresh process rebinds a listening
    port while a connection its crashed predecessor accepted is still in
    `TIME_WAIT`. A listening socket that never accepted does not enter `TIME_WAIT`
    itself, which is what the comment had actually been reasoning about.
  - **Sharing a port on purpose is still opt-in, and it is a different option.**
    `core::net::PortSharing::Shared` (`SO_REUSEPORT`, POSIX only; core-cpp refuses
    it on Windows) is what lets N reactor threads bind one port and have the kernel
    load-balance across them. Exclusivity is the default, not the only setting, and
    both halves are asserted -- the exclusive bind refused, and two `Shared`
    listeners sharing.
  - **A `setsockopt` carrying a security property is not best-effort.** It fails
    the candidate rather than being ignored the way `TCP_NODELAY` and
    `IPV6_V6ONLY` are: a daemon that silently came up shareable is worse than one
    that visibly did not come up at all.
  - **The discovery beacon's UDP socket keeps `SO_REUSEADDR`, and it is a
    different question rather than the same one answered differently.**
    `OpenUdpSocket` binds the wildcard on the *shared* beacon port so every node
    on the segment hears the broadcast, and claiming that port exclusively would
    let the first process on a host lock every other one out of hearing beacons
    at all. What sharing it does **not** buy is two nodes on one host completing
    the handshake: measured on Windows 11 and on Linux, two sockets on one port
    both receive a broadcast and only one receives a unicast -- and the challenge
    and the proof are both unicast to `received->from` (`DiscoveryService.cpp`).
    That was a defect in discovery rather than in the bind option, and #126 fixed
    it where it lived: a node now **listens** on the shared port and **answers**
    from one only it holds, so sharing is asked for per socket
    (`PortSharing`) rather than being every UDP socket's default. See
    `.agent/rules/consensus-and-cluster.md`.
  - **A port a node binds itself is bound AGAIN by every serving body, never kept and
    duplicated across bodies -- because on Windows the duplicate cannot be served.** A
    completion-port association belongs to the SOCKET, not to the handle, and every
    body has its own reactor: once one body's duplicate was associated with its IOCP,
    associating a new duplicate with the next body's IOCP is refused
    (`CreateIoCompletionPort` error 87), measured on Windows 11 build 26200. The rebind
    it costs is safe there, measured the same day: an exclusive rebind at once succeeds
    after a server-first close, a client-first close, and with an accepted connection
    still open. `FrameEndpoint_test`'s reform case holds the last two shapes; the
    duplicate stays a POSIX socket-activation device (`Node::ActivationHold`), and
    must never be extended to Windows.

- **A listener asks for an accept-queue DEPTH, and a plain number does not say one on
  Windows.** A connect that finds the queue of completed handshakes full is not refused:
  Linux drops the SYN and Windows answers late, and the client's kernel retransmits after a
  second -- so a launcher with a short connect bound reads a node that is UP as unreachable,
  on the machine whose own build is largest (#1668). #1668 gave the node's framed surfaces a
  deep queue; the consensus listener still bound a bare `core::net::ListenOptions` (core-cpp's
  default of 128), and the daemon's `--listen-backlog` of 511 reached a Windows `::listen`
  that holds any plain number to about 200 -- deeper takes `SOMAXCONN_HINT(n)`, which is
  `-(n)` (#1679). So there is ONE depth, `ListenQueueDepth` (`Transport/ListenQueue.hpp`,
  where #1668's measured Windows table now lives), every listener states it -- the daemon's
  default and `BlockingListener::Bind`'s included -- and `ListenBacklogArgument` spells it at
  the two places this tree hands a backlog on, `ListenOptions::backlog` and `::listen`, the
  operator's value too; `LoopListenOptions` is a loop listener's. **Asserted against the
  KERNEL** (`src/tests/ListenQueueLimit.hpp`, `TCP_INFO` on Linux): a helper's return value
  says nothing about what reached `::listen`. When core-cpp#74 gives `ListenOptions` a depth
  of its own, `ListenBacklogArgument` is what goes.

- **A platform socket error is classified in one place.** `Detail::TranslateError`
  in `BlockingSocket.cpp` mapped ten conditions onto `NetErrorCode`;
  `BlockingConnector` then grew a three-condition copy of it, so `EACCES` — a
  firewall or a privileged port, the two most likely reasons an outbound
  connection is refused *administratively* — came back as an unclassified
  `SystemError`, and a caller matching on `PermissionDenied` never saw it. It is
  now `Detail::TranslateSocketError`, published from `BlockingSocket.hpp` and used
  by both; the connector's own contribution, `ENETUNREACH`/`WSAENETUNREACH`, moved
  into the table rather than being lost, beside `EHOSTUNREACH` because no route
  and no answer are the same fact to a caller: this endpoint is unreachable from
  here, and neither is retryable at this layer.
- **A failure is reported with its reason, and the reason has to be captured where
  it is still in scope.** `ReadWholeFile` in `FileRaftStorage` returned a `bool`,
  so every caller could say no more than `cannot read <path>` — the one thing the
  operator already knew. Each step there fails for a different and actionable
  cause (the path is a directory, the permissions are wrong, the file shrank
  under the read), `std::filesystem` reports through `error_code` and `fopen`
  through `errno`, and a caller handed a `bool` cannot recover either. It returns
  `std::expected<void, ConsensusError>` and translates both at the point of
  failure. A missing file stays *success with nothing read*: a store starting for
  the first time is the ordinary case, not a fault.
- **EOF means "this peer has finished sending", not "this peer is gone" — and a
  server answers what is already determined while abandoning what is still
  pending.** Three places in this tree answered that question and disagreed, so it
  was settled against a running reference rather than by argument
  ([#671](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/671)).

  **How it was determined, because a citation without its conditions outlives its
  own truth.** `redis-server 7.0.15` on `Linux 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2`,
  stock configuration (`--save "" --appendonly no`), driven over raw sockets. Every
  scenario has a control, so a null result cannot be read as an answer:

  <!-- table-total: none -->
  | | observed |
  |---|---|
  | `BLPOP` + half-close, then a push arrives | server closed, **no reply** |
  | `BLPOP`, no half-close, then a push arrives *(control)* | reply delivered |
  | `PING` + immediate half-close | `+PONG` delivered |
  | `BLPOP` + half-close, nothing ever pushed | server closed promptly |
  | `SET`, `GET`, `BLPOP` pipelined, then half-close | `+OK`, `written`, then EOF |
  | blocked clients in the server's own `CLIENT LIST` | **1 before the half-close, 0 after** |
  | same, without the half-close *(control)* | 1, stays |

  The `CLIENT LIST` row is the one to rest on: the drop is visible in the *server's
  own view of its clients*, so it depends on no inference from a client socket —
  which is the failure mode of every probe that reads a close as an absence. The
  pipelined row rules out a race, since two determined replies came back in order
  and only the block was abandoned.

  - **It is neither of the two doctrines this tree held, and both.** *Finished
    sending* for replies already determined — which is `RedisResp`'s reading and
    every `ShutdownWrite` test's — and *gone* for futures still pending, which is
    the compile surface's. That the contradiction resolves without either side
    being simply wrong is the sign the framing was off rather than one of the
    verdicts.

  - **`ArmDisconnect`'s comment asserts the opposite of the reference.** It says of
    a half-closed blocked client that *"abandoning the read there would be wrong"*.
    The measurement is that the reference unblocks exactly such a client and frees
    the connection — deliberately, as its own `CLIENT LIST` shows. A comment
    asserting what nothing checks cannot make the code fail, and this one had been
    contradicting the reference for as long as it had been there.

  - **The compile surface is vindicated by the RULE, not by transfer.** #662 reads
    EOF during a compile as *gone* and skips writing the object. That is not Redis's
    answer carried onto the `0xFC` wire — answers do not transfer between wires, and
    a half-close mid-compile means something different from one mid-`BLPOP`. It is
    the same rule evaluated on a different surface: a compile's reply is not
    determined when the watcher fires, so it is a pending future, and abandoning it
    is what the rule prescribes. State which surface any future measurement covers.

  - **The memcached, RESP-command and admin surfaces are unaffected.** They have no
    blocking verbs, so every reply is determined and *answer what you owe* is what
    their `ShutdownWrite` tests already assert.

  - **A judgement that a real client "would not do that" is not this rule.** The
    reading that got there first was *a real `XREAD BLOCK 0` client keeps its
    connection open, so the two blocking tests are an artifact* — a guess about
    clients, and right by accident. The measurement is sharper and about servers: if
    a client does half-close, **the reference drops it**, so those tests assert a
    reply the reference would never send. Same conclusion, and only one of the two
    can be checked.

  - **`ISocket::ShutdownWrite` exists so the question is askable in production.** It
    did not, and that absence is why the disagreement was unreachable from inside
    the repository. Not for want of VISIBILITY — `InMemorySocket::ShutdownWrite` has
    been public since the MVP commit (`57076ec6`) and some forty tests call it — but
    because it sat on the CONCRETE type. Nothing holding an `ISocket&` could reach
    it, so every consumer was a test by construction, and "make it public" was never
    the missing step: production code never names `InMemorySocket`. A rule nothing can
    express is a rule nothing can be held to. The default is a no-op for fakes; every
    transport this library hands out overrides it.

  - **The error-only reading detected neither way a client leaves**, and
    `ArmDisconnect` now reads the COUNT
    ([#673](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/673)).
    `RedisResp.cpp`'s *"a full peer close surfaces as the error case"* is false on
    IOCP — a full close arrives as readable, measured while landing #662 — and the
    table above adds that a **half**-close is acted on too, which an error-only rule
    cannot see at all. Two arms, and they answer different questions: an ERROR is an
    abortive close (RST), a count of **`0`** is EOF, and EOF is the ordinary way a
    client goes away. A count `>0` is still not a disconnect — it is a pipelined
    command — so this is not "readable means gone", which would abandon every
    blocking read the instant it parked.

    **A watch is proved by DELETING an arm, never by a passing suite**, because both
    arms set one flag and either alone makes every test green. That is how #673 was
    found (delete the error arm on IOCP: 7 cases, 61 assertions, all still pass — so
    it had never fired) and it is how its fix is checked: delete the EOF arm and
    exactly one case fails, `RESP: XREAD BLOCK 0 is abandoned when the peer closes
    gracefully`, while its control stays green. The control is not optional — without
    a case that must survive an open write side, "detect a graceful close" and
    "abandon everything" are the same passing test.

  - **And on the compile surface those two arms are now COUNTED apart, so they may not
    be folded even though both reach one outcome.** `WatchPeer` sets `gone` either
    way, which is what makes the fold look free — and
    [#1090](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1090) proposed
    exactly it, collapsing to `!readable.has_value() || *readable == 0` once the probe
    `Read` went. That form reaches the right verdict and **cannot say which departure
    it was**: a peer that RESET and one that said goodbye are different diagnoses, and
    only the first is worth an alert
    ([#1092](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1092)). A graceful
    mid-answer departure is a cancelled build or a reclaimed CI runner and its rate
    means nothing; a rise in abortive closes is crashing clients, a lost route, or a
    middlebox resetting long-lived connections. Both landed together for that reason —
    the cleanup is real and the distinction survives it, each arm naming a
    `PeerDeparture` that a table maps to its counter.

    The pair is proved the same way the arms above are, by neutering: reporting every
    departure abortive fails ONLY the FIN case, reporting the abortive arm graceful
    fails ONLY the RESET case. **The FIN case is the load-bearing one** — an
    implementation that counts every departure as abortive passes the RESET case, so a
    suite holding only the positive assertion is green over it.

    And the signal is that the HANDLER RETURNED, not that a reply was empty: a reader
    still parked and one that unwound having written nothing produce identical bytes,
    which is why the in-memory suite could not see this even after
    `InMemorySocket::WaitReadable` made the condition expressible (#677).

  The probes are `scripts/probes/redis-eof-semantics.py`, runnable in about two
  minutes against any `redis-server`. A rule people can re-run is one they stop
  re-litigating.

- **A peer that has sent NOTHING has asked nothing, so there is nothing to answer --
  and "it sent nothing" is two states, not one, neither of which is "the request was
  bad".** The admin HTTP surface read its request head behind a `bool ok` and refused
  every falsy reason `400 Bad Request`, so a connection the peer had opened and left
  silent past the request deadline was *told its request was malformed*
  ([#824](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/824)). This is the
  EOF rule above evaluated on a fourth surface, and it lands the other way from
  RESP's: a reply is owed for what is already DETERMINED, and a peer that has not
  spoken has determined nothing.
  - **It reached production because every fixture in this tree sends immediately.**
    A browser opens speculative *preconnect* sockets ahead of a navigation and may
    send on one much later or never, so the failing client was Chrome and the passing
    one was `curl` — and sixteen `AdminHttpServer` cases, none of which asserted a
    `400` at all, could not see it. The shape to add to a server fixture is the
    client that connects and waits, not another that connects and asks.
  - **Four outcomes, and the two that owe silence are still two.** `Idle` (the
    deadline expired with nothing received) and `PeerGone` (the peer left with
    nothing received) share today's disposition and are *different facts about the
    peer*; folding them because the answer currently matches is how the `bool` this
    replaces was built. `Malformed` keeps the `400` it always deserved, and a head
    over the byte cap is `431` — which was not merely uncounted before but
    MISANSWERED: the read loop stopped at the cap and the truncated prefix was then
    parsed and SERVED, so a request line (which is at the front and always survives)
    routed while every header past byte 8192 vanished, and a browser whose
    `Authorization` fell beyond it was told `401`.
  - **Neither silent outcome is counted, and that is a decision.**
    `.agent/rules/metrics-and-observability.md`'s limit applies exactly here: not
    every refusal is an EVENT, and an abandoned preconnect is what a HEALTHY browser
    produces many times a minute. A counter on it is a series that never rests.
  - **A deadline expiry is TWO error codes and the platforms disagree about which.**
    `SO_RCVTIMEO` expires as `EAGAIN`/`EWOULDBLOCK` on POSIX and `WSAETIMEDOUT` on
    Winsock, so a reader spelling only the obvious one is correct on one platform and
    silently wrong on the other. It was open-coded at three sites in two subsystems;
    it is `Net::IsDeadlineExpiry` now, beside the enum, which is a dependency-free
    leaf and so costs nothing at the `net-boundary` line.
    **No accept loop spells either code any more**: core-cpp's `core::net::AcceptErrorTable`
    (`<core/net/AcceptPolicy.hpp>`, graduated from this tree at core-cpp 0.6.0) classifies
    every `core::net::NetErrorCode` for all five loops, and
    both poll codes are `PollTick` there -- *the poll ticked, re-check the stop flag, accept
    again*. The history is kept because it is the trap the table closes. `FrameEndpoint`
    once tested `WouldBlock` ALONE, correctly, for a REACHABILITY reason (that listener arms
    no poll timeout); calling the reason semantic -- "on an accept, `WouldBlock` is not a
    deadline expiring" -- was FALSE, and invited dropping `WouldBlock` from
    `IsDeadlineExpiry`, which would have made `AdminHttpServer::Run` and
    `RaftPeerServer::Run` treat every POSIX poll tick as fatal and stop accepting a quarter
    of a second after they started. **A reason that generalises further than the fact it
    was drawn from is worse than the narrow one.** A row in one table has no such reason to
    get wrong.
  - **A failed accept is almost never a failed LISTENER, so only a closed or vanished one
    ends an accept loop** -- `Cancelled` (`Closed`) and `BadHandle` (`Dead`), the only two
    dispositions that end one; a `Dead` listener is CLOSED by the loop, so its port refuses
    rather than queues.
    Every loop in the tree used to end on any code but the poll tick, at `Debug`, with the
    listening socket left open: the backlog then fills and the kernel refuses every later
    connect, for as long as the process runs. On Windows an `AcceptEx` completes with
    `WSAECONNRESET` when a client resets its QUEUED connection -- a launcher killed
    mid-exchange, or one whose 1 s budget ran out under load -- and that one event stopped
    the installed node's 0xFC surface for nine hours while `/healthz` answered `200`.
    Reproduced on a scratch node by flooding it with client resets: dark after 149
    connections, `accept loop ended (connection reset (AcceptEx) [errno 10054])`.
    - A failed CONNECTION is accepted past with a rate-limited `Warn`; an EXHAUSTION
      (`ResourceExhausted`: `EMFILE`, `ENFILE`, `ENOBUFS`, `ENOMEM` and their Winsock twins,
      rows of `NativeListen`'s `SocketErrors` for the blocking listeners) waits a bounded
      backoff first, on the loop's own timer (`WaitOutBackoff`: the reactor's, or the
      injected blocking wait for a loop that owns its thread). A failure NOTHING classifies
      (`SystemError`) is backed off on too, and a run of `UnclassifiedBeforeDegraded` of them
      reports the loop DEGRADED -- in the registry until an accept succeeds or the loop
      stops; and every `FailuresBeforeYield`
      failed connections in a row the loop YIELDS for `FirstBackoff`, because a listener
      whose accept fails without suspending would otherwise never yield its reactor. The
      hang that found this was a FIXTURE answering `Eof` to end a loop.
    - **A yield, never a backoff that grows, for failed CONNECTIONS**: each one consumed a
      queued connection, so the loop is DRAINING a backlog, and slowing it is what keeps a
      port refusing. Measured: the first cut doubled to a second per failure, and after a
      15 s flood of resets the raft port refused connects until its backlog of dead
      connections had drained at one a second. Backing off is for EXHAUSTION alone.
    - A loop that ends while its surface is NOT shutting down says so at `Error` and in the
      process's `core::net::AcceptLoopHealth`, which `/healthz` (`503` naming the surface) and
      the node's `surface-not-accepting` condition both read; a DEGRADED loop is reported
      there too, `503` naming it degraded and the LIVE `surface-accept-degraded` row. Every
      loop carries the verdicts out through ONE `Transport/AcceptLoopReporter`, so the five
      agree on the level and the record. **A listening port is not a
      serving one**, and a liveness probe that asks nothing is the confident wrong signal.
      The ADMIN loop is the one `/healthz` cannot report, since the thread that would answer
      `503` is the one that ended -- a probe times out instead, measured -- so on the node its
      end is carried by that condition row (NODE-STATUS (`pacectl node`) and the fleet page, both over
      other surfaces), and the daemon has only the `Error` line.
    - A fixture that ends a loop by answering some error is now a fixture that SPINS: it
      must answer `Cancelled`, the way a closed listener does. core-cpp's
      `core::net::testing::FailingListener` is the shared fake for the opposite -- failures a
      loop must survive.
  - **The reported shape cannot be asserted on, and its deterministic twin can.**
    *Connect, wait, then ask* is a RACE to observe: an unfixed server answers and
    closes at the deadline, the client's late write then draws an RST, and the RST
    discards the receive buffer holding the response the assertion is about.
    Measured against one unfixed binary: a `python` client read the `400`, a bash
    client read nothing, and a fixture built on that passes on the bug about half the
    time. *Connect and never write* provokes no RST, so what comes back is what the
    server volunteered — a `400` every time on the unfixed binary. Assert the shape
    you can observe, not the shape the report described.
  - **And a probe that reports silence must be able to say it never observed any.**
    An expired `read -t` yields an empty body, byte-identical to *the server said
    nothing* — which is the probe's own answer. `http_response_to_silence` refuses
    instead, and the selftest case that stages a peer which neither speaks nor closes
    is what caught the two defects in that refusal: `while read ...; do ...; done`
    leaves `$?` holding the last command of the BODY (so a peer that says nothing
    gives a clean `0`), and moving the read out of the condition made its failure
    fatal under `set -e`, which one fixture sets and another does not.
  - **What makes a head refusable is that it is UNFINISHED, not how the read ended.**
    The guard was `!sawHeadEnd && buffer.size() >= MaxRequestBytes`, which closed the
    byte-cap route and left the EOF route wide open — and the EOF route needs no
    oversize client at all, only a peer that half-closes after its request line. Same
    wrong answer (`/fleet` telling a valid credential `401`), reached with a
    thirty-byte request. `sawHeadEnd` decides THAT a refusal happens; the cause only
    selects WHICH code — cap `431`, deadline `408`, EOF `400`.
    **And this is the EOF rule applied more carefully, not an exception to it.** The
    tempting reading — *EOF means the peer finished sending, so serve what arrived* —
    had a control case in `AdminHttpServer_test.cpp` asserting exactly that, which is
    how the hole survived review: the bug was written down as the intended behaviour.
    A reply is owed for what is DETERMINED, and an HTTP head with no terminating blank
    line determines nothing — this server does not know which headers the peer would
    have sent. `PING` half-closed is a complete command; this is a sentence cut off
    mid-word. The control that belongs there is a COMPLETE head half-closed after,
    still served `200`, or *refuse an unfinished head* and *refuse every peer that
    half-closes* are one passing test and every probe on the endpoint breaks.

  - **Closing is better than refusing and is not the whole fix.** A closed connection
    is retriable where a `400` is final, but the idle connection is still not SERVED,
    because one number — `AdminHttpServer::RequestTimeout` — answers both *how long
    may a peer be silent before it starts* and *how long may a head take*. That is
    the same defect `.agent/rules/distributed-compilation.md` records for the compile
    deadline, on another wire.
    [#828](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/828).

- **A TLS peer says "I have finished sending" with a RECORD, so the raw socket
  cannot answer that question, and delegating to it was reporting the opposite.**
  A well-behaved peer emits `close_notify` and only THEN the transport FIN, so at
  the instant it goes away there are bytes on the wire: `TlsSocket::WaitReadable`
  deferred to `_raw->WaitReadable()`, which peeked, saw the alert as data and
  answered `>0`. #673's EOF arm therefore declined for every TLS client, on the one
  transport where the graceful close is the ORDINARY close rather than a corner
  ([#712](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/712)). The record
  is decrypted now, by `SSL_peek`, which removes nothing OpenSSL decoded -- so
  `SSL_pending()` reports the whole record afterwards and the caller's next `Read`
  returns every byte of it. Four things travel with it:
  - **"Consumes nothing" is about bytes the CALLER could have read.** The probe does
    consume raw ciphertext into the decorator's own incoming BIO, and must: that is
    the only way to have an answer. What the contract forbids is losing a byte the
    next `Read` would have returned, which is why the control case reads the
    plaintext back after the probe rather than merely checking a count.
  - **Three answers, and the third is the one nobody writes down.** A decrypted byte
    is `>0`; `SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN` is `0`; and a raw EOF arriving BEFORE a full
    record is `0` too -- a truncated stream is still a peer that has stopped
    sending, and it is also the case the old delegation got right, so a fix pinned
    only on `close_notify` can silently break it.
  - **It writes, like every other TLS read**, which `ShutdownWrite`'s own comment
    already recorded for `Read`: the `WANT_READ` path flushes whatever OpenSSL has
    queued outbound, so a failure there surfaces as a `NetError` from a call a
    plaintext socket answers with a count.
  - **The case that reproduces it is the one that looks redundant.** Over an
    in-memory wire the pre-fix version answers `1` *synchronously* when the wire is
    idle, so a case that arms the wait, closes, and only then checks the count is
    red for the right reason by accident. The assertion that the wait had NOT
    resolved before the peer acted is what separates "parked, then told EOF" from
    "never parked at all". Measured on Linux x86-64 (GCC 15 / libstdc++, OpenSSL
    3.5): 3 of 5 cases fail on the parent commit, `1 == 0`.
- **`TlsSocket` forwards `SetReceiveDeadline` to the socket a read blocks on**
  ([#1557](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1557)). It inherited
  the base's no-op, so under TLS #828's preconnect budget never reached the socket, which
  kept the `RequestTimeout` its listener gave it at accept -- a silent TLS peer held the
  admin thread for as long as that, whatever the surface asked for. `ISocket`'s no-op
  defaults are for FAKES, which have nothing to forward to; a decorator always has
  something, so an inherited default on one is a forwarding nobody wrote. The case over a
  real pair gives the raw socket a LONG deadline of its own, so the defect is measured by
  it rather than hanging the case.
- **A close over unread input is a RESET, and a reset destroys the answer the peer had
  not read yet -- so a server that answers a request it did not finish reading, and
  then closes, closes through `CloseLingering`**
  ([#1554](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1554)). Measured on
  loopback (#1553): Windows drops every byte already buffered for the reader and fails
  the read at once; Linux and macOS hand those bytes over first. So every refusal written
  over a request the server stopped reading -- `-ERR Protocol error` past
  `maxPayloadBytes`, the admin surface's `431`, `408` and `503` -- reached a Linux client
  and a reset reached a Windows one, which is the client the refusal was for. The admin
  case *a request split across reads is consumed to the end* pins the same mechanism with
  a different remedy: a head can be read to its end before answering, and a refusal's
  whole point is not reading on. `CloseLingering` half-closes, so the answer is followed
  by a FIN a well-behaved peer closes on; discards what the peer still sends until it
  closes or `LingerBounds` stop it; then closes; and says which of those ended it. Five
  things travel with it:
  - **It is ONE helper, and the node already had a second.** `FrameEndpoint` drained
    before closing on its at-capacity refusal and its oversize step-over through a
    private `DrainUntilPeerCloses`, correct and without the half-close. Both call
    `CloseLingering` now and the copy is gone, because a surface that answers and hangs
    up is the helper's whole population and the next one should find one door.
  - **The bounds are rows, one per surface, and they bound three things**:
    `Connection::Linger`, `AdminHttpServer::Linger` and the node's `RefusalLinger`. A
    byte cap, which is what a fast peer meets -- never more than serving would have read.
    A deadline, which is one reactor deadline over the whole drain, or `total / reads`
    per read on a blocking socket, where a read that meets its share in silence ends the
    linger; the admin's sockets block its one thread, which is why its row is short. The
    node's row arms NO deadline of its own: its connections are tracked, and the sweep
    that closes a silent one is counted by phase, so a second deadline would end the wait
    first and hide the sweep that exists to count it. Under TLS the per-read share reaches
    the raw socket only because `TlsSocket` forwards `SetReceiveDeadline` (#1557).
  - **A lingering connection is still a connection.** It holds its admission slot until
    it closes -- `OnConnectionEnded` runs after `Connection::Run`, which includes the
    linger -- or lingering would be a way to hold sockets past the cap. Asserted on both
    sides of the deadline, not only after it.
  - **A peer that finished costs ONE read**, which answers EOF or the reset at once, so
    an ordinary goodbye is never turned into a wait -- the outcome says `PeerFinished`
    after one read, and a case asserts exactly that. Past the bounds the close is a reset
    anyway; a refusal is never bought by reading an unbounded upload.
  - **What it does NOT cover: a close that follows a request READ TO THE END, or no
    answer at all.** `QUIT` on memcached text, memcached binary and RESP replies and
    closes inside the handler, and RESP's has to -- that close is what cancels its
    subscribe watcher -- so the only reply a reset can cost there is one to a client that
    pipelined bytes past its own `QUIT`. The Raft acceptor's signed refusals follow a
    proof the dialler sends and then waits on, so nothing is unread when it closes. And a
    connection refused at ACCEPT, a sweep, or a failed handshake writes nothing a reset
    could take back. The rule is about a refusal written over a request the server
    STOPPED reading, not about every close.
- **An AcceptEx socket is not a whole socket until `SO_UPDATE_ACCEPT_CONTEXT`**, the
  mirror of the `SO_UPDATE_CONNECT_CONTEXT` `IocpConnector` already sets. Without it
  `shutdown` fails `WSAENOTCONN`, and `ShutdownWrite` ignores its result, so until
  [#1556](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1556) every socket
  `IocpListener` accepted half-closed as a silent no-op: no FIN, and writes went on
  succeeding. Best-effort rather than a failed accept, because a failed accept ends an
  accept loop over a socket that still reads and writes. Found by pinning the in-memory
  socket against a real pair (#1553), which no in-memory case and no Linux gate could do;
  `AcceptedHalfClose_test.cpp` holds the accepted socket open until its peer has read,
  because a close's own FIN would otherwise pass for the half-close's.

## Dialing, and the reactor underneath it

<!-- agent-tripwire: A synchronous dial spends a thread the caller does not own -->

- **A synchronous dial spends a thread the caller does not own, and the argument
  for it reasoned about the wrong thing.** `IConnector::Connect` blocked, and its
  header defended that at length: the caller has nothing to do until the
  connection exists, so a coroutine "would buy the ability to interleave work
  that does not exist", with one rule holding it up -- **a reactor thread never
  calls this**. Three things were wrong with it, and the third had already
  shipped:
  - **The caller has nothing to do; the THREAD has thousands of other
    connections.** The argument described one caller's own work and silently
    ignored whose thread it was spending. That is the same mistake, in the same
    direction, that `Net/PlatformListener.hpp` records for the accept side.
  - **The rule was not free, it was paid for.** `RaftPeerTransport` owned a
    thread per peer *because of this interface*, and it could not be made safe:
    thread-per-peer is only expressible over a blocking socket, because the write
    was driven by `SyncRun` -- which this list already records throwing the
    instant its task really suspends. So the decision pinned one component's
    outbound half to `BlockingSocket` for good while its inbound half was already
    on the reactor: two socket implementations in one class, chosen by direction.
  - **It hid a hang that killed nodes.** The transport passes no I/O timeout,
    deliberately, so over a blocking socket there is no `SO_SNDTIMEO` and a peer
    that accepts and then stops reading parks the sender inside `::send` once the
    buffer fills. `Stop()` cleared the outbox, notified a condition variable the
    sender was not waiting on, and joined it unconditionally -- and the socket was
    a LOCAL of the sender, so nothing else could reach it to close it.
    `~RaftPeerTransport` blocked forever and the node died to SIGKILL, which is
    the `systemctl stop` escalation this list already records once, reached from
    the outbound side.

  And the rule never covered the worst case anyway: `connectTimeout` bounds the
  dial, while **name resolution runs first and is bounded by nothing**, because
  `getaddrinfo` takes no timeout. For `pace-cc` that is every translation
  unit in a build waiting on a wedged resolver with no knob anywhere.
  Consequences that are each load-bearing:
  - **`Connect` takes `std::string` by value, not `string_view`.** A coroutine
    frame outlives the call expression, so a view names storage the caller may
    already have destroyed -- the hazard `Net/TcpClient.hpp` records for reference
    parameters, reached by another route. clang-tidy enforces the reference half
    (`cppcoreguidelines-avoid-reference-coroutine-parameters`) and cannot see the
    view half, which is why it is written down. The copy is one the threaded
    resolver needed anyway.
  - **`ioTimeout` left the interface.** It is `SO_RCVTIMEO`, which bounds a
    *blocking* syscall and is inert on a socket whose reads suspend -- so keeping
    it would hand every reactor caller a bound that does not exist, which is worse
    than having none. It survives as `BlockingConnectorOptions::ioTimeout`. A
    reactor caller arms a `DeadlineTimer` that closes the socket instead, which is
    strictly *more* than the option gave: the option bounds one call, so a peer
    dribbling a byte at a time could still take forever.
  - **The budget is divided across candidates, and both halves are needed.**
    Giving every candidate the full timeout means a caller asking for two seconds
    waits four -- a bound that multiplies by however many addresses a name happens
    to have is not a bound. Giving the FIRST candidate all of it defeats the
    fallback whenever that candidate black-holes rather than refuses, which is the
    AAAA-on-a-machine-with-no-IPv6 case trying every candidate exists for. Found
    on Windows, where a closed loopback port is silently *dropped* rather than
    reset: the dead candidate consumed the whole budget and the real one was never
    tried. The test had been passing only because each candidate previously got a
    fresh timeout.
  - **`DialEndpointBlocking` takes a `BlockingConnector&`, never an
    `IConnector&`.** Every remaining `SyncRun` is sound only because the socket
    underneath resolves inline, and the failure when it does not is a
    `std::logic_error` thrown from inside a heartbeat thread. A comment saying so
    is a rule somebody breaks; the type is the rule.
  - **A literal address never reaches a resolver thread.** Every internal dial
    here is to one -- Raft peers, `127.0.0.1:6674`, an endpoint discovery proved --
    and the launcher makes one per translation unit, so a thread hand-off on that
    path would be a real regression. It is also what lets the whole connect path be
    tested without a thread existing. The pool is fixed at two (never one per dial;
    never sized to cores, since this is I/O-bound) and its queue is bounded and
    *refused* rather than waited on, which is the same shape as the pre-auth
    payload cap.

- **Four defects sat between the reactor and a dial that could work, and three of
  them were already latent.**
  - **`EpollReactor` routed only `EPOLLIN` and `EPOLLOUT`, and dropped
    `EPOLLERR`/`EPOLLHUP`.** Those arrive whether or not they were requested, and a
    failed connect can be reported with neither direction set -- so the dial would
    never be told, and because the fd is level-triggered it would be re-reported on
    the very next iteration: a hang AND a loop spinning at 100% CPU, with nothing
    logged at either end. `EpollFdHandler::onError` is where an error goes now, and
    `SelectEpollCallback` is a pure function precisely so the rule is unit-testable
    without a socket or a way to provoke a kernel error.
  - **That same loop read `handler->onWritable` after `onReadable` may have freed
    the object the handler lives in.** It services at most one callback per fd per
    iteration now; level-triggering re-reports whatever was skipped, so the cost is
    one extra turn.
  - **`TestReactor::Submit`/`Schedule` touched bare containers** while `IReactor`
    documents both as callable from any thread. Nothing noticed while every
    producer was the test's own thread -- and every primitive added here crosses
    threads by definition, so a double that cannot be used the way its interface
    reads forces each of those cases onto a real reactor, where nothing is
    deterministic.
  - **`IListener` had no `BoundPort()`**, so only `BlockingListener` could answer
    "which port did I actually get" -- the question every caller binding port 0 has
    to ask, and the one every script-driven test here relies on.

- **The dial's own residuals are recorded rather than dressed up.**
  - **The handler detach in `SettleDial` guards the reactor's loop against a spin,
    NOT the socket built afterwards.** It looks as though it should guard both: the
    socket's constructor attaches the same fd, epoll refuses that with `EEXIST`,
    and the failure is ignored. But `UpdateInterest` uses `EPOLL_CTL_MOD` with a
    fresh `ev.data.ptr`, so the socket's first armed read overwrites the stale
    registration. Verified by removing the detach and watching the byte-transfer
    case still pass. Claiming otherwise would send the next reader looking for a
    bug that is not there.
  - **A loopback connect completes INLINE, so the readiness path is unreachable
    from an ordinary test.** `::connect` returns 0 and the whole
    attach/park/settle block is skipped, which means a dial test that stops at
    "connected" exercises none of it. Provoking it needs a filled accept queue.
  - **On IOCP an accept must be awaited while it is outstanding.**
    `IocpListener::Accept` issues `AcceptEx` immediately but records the awaitable
    only in its suspend callback, so a completion arriving before anyone awaits is
    dropped and the accept never resolves. Arming the accept before a dial and
    awaiting it after -- which reads naturally and works on epoll -- deadlocks.
  - **Both connector tests move BYTES, and arrange the read to park.** `Read` tries
    the syscall before suspending, so a read finding data or EOF already waiting
    would be answered perfectly well by a socket the reactor was never told about.
    Only a read with nothing to return proves the registration exists -- and on
    Windows only a real transfer proves `SO_UPDATE_CONNECT_CONTEXT` was applied,
    without which the socket is connected and every ordinary call on it fails.

- **`ConnectEx` needs two steps `AcceptEx` does not, and neither had precedent
  here.** The socket must be `bind`-ed to the wildcard of its family before the
  call, or it fails with `WSAEINVAL` and names nothing; and
  `SO_UPDATE_CONNECT_CONTEXT` must be applied afterwards, or the handle's context
  stays unset and `getpeername`, `shutdown` and the ordinary calls all fail on a
  socket that is genuinely connected. The extension pointer is cached in a two-row
  table keyed by family, because a connector -- unlike a listener, which has one
  family -- dials whichever the resolver hands it. `IocpSocket` therefore takes an
  `IocpAttachment`: `ConnectEx` requires the port association BEFORE the operation
  is issued, and a second `CreateIoCompletionPort` on an associated handle fails,
  so without it the constructor would report `IsAttached() == false` and tell the
  caller to abandon a connection that works. And **`overlapped.Internal` is an
  NTSTATUS, not a WSA code**: the reactor hands it over as-is, so `0xC0000236`
  (refused) falls through every `WSAE*` row onto `SystemError` -- useless to a
  connector whose job is to tell refused from unreachable. `WSAGetOverlappedResult`
  is the documented conversion. The same wart affects IOCP reads and writes today
  and is left alone deliberately: their `Dispatch` cannot reach the socket handle.

## Socket and coroutine lifetime

<!-- agent-tripwire: `Close()` can be the last thing that runs on a socket, so it must touch no member after it completes an awaitable -->

- **`Close()` can be the last thing that runs on a socket, so it must touch no member
  after it completes an awaitable.** `EpollSocket::Close` walked `{readOp, writeOp}`
  and completed each parked awaitable inside the loop. Completing one resumes the
  coroutine that was waiting on it -- and a coroutine that OWNS the socket
  (`ServePeer` holds it in a by-value `unique_ptr` parameter) then runs to its end and
  destroys it, so the loop's next iteration reads `_impl->writeOp` out of freed
  memory. Reported by ASan as a heap-use-after-free from `RaftPeerServer::Shutdown`,
  which is the one caller that closes accepted connections from outside their own
  coroutines. The awaitables are detached from the ops first and completed last now,
  with `_fd` cleared before them. Two things worth keeping: the parked awaitables live
  in their coroutines' own frames rather than in `_impl`, which is what makes it safe
  to complete the second after the first has taken the socket down; and the same edit
  went to `KqueueSocket::Close`, which was a copy of the same loop and had the same
  defect on a platform where nothing had ever run a sanitizer either.
- **An object a reactor owns is destroyed on that reactor's WORKER THREAD, or with
  that reactor STOPPED** — `IReactor::TeardownIsSerialisedWithDispatch()`, which is
  `!Running() || IsOnWorkerThread()`. Clearing a pending awaitable anywhere else races
  the completion dispatch that would read it.
  [#668](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/668) landed the
  predicate, `Detail::AssertTeardownIsSerialisedWithDispatch` and the must-die
  `reactor-teardown-canary`; **it did not land a rule here, and that is the reason
  this entry exists** — the constraint was expressed only in code, so it fired for
  nobody who had not already opened `IocpSocket.cpp`.
  - **The defect is portable; only the PREDICATE was Windows-only.** `Running()` and
    `IsOnWorkerThread()` lived on `IocpReactor` and nowhere else, so epoll and kqueue
    never checked — not because the ordering is safe there, but because their
    `Close()` resumes inline and the race has a cheaper consequence. It still resumes
    and unwinds a per-connection coroutine on the STOPPING thread while the reactor
    dispatches, which is the same hazard one bullet up.
  - **A drain that waits for the loops cannot also mean the reactor has stopped.** The
    last loop decrements its own counter *before* calling `NodeIoLoop::NoteLoopFinished()`,
    and `Stop()` only sets a flag and posts a wakeup, so `Running()` stays true until
    `Run()` returns. `~FrameEndpoint` destroyed its listener inside exactly that gap
    ([#840](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/840)).
  - **Posting the teardown and waiting for it is the tempting fix and it hangs on the
    ordinary case.** A node runs ONE framed surface, so the endpoint being dropped is
    usually the last loop: the reactor is already stopping, the posted task is never
    dequeued, and the wait can only end at its ceiling. **Deferring is the third
    option** — `NodeIoLoop::Retire` holds the listener in a member declared after the
    reactor and before the thread, so it is freed after the join and before the reactor
    it names. No wait, no ceiling, no race; the cost is that its memory (not its
    descriptor, which `Shutdown()` already closed) lives as long as the loop.
  - **Its one observer was `Windows-cl-debug`, which does not gate**, and it fired
    intermittently in a different `FrameEndpoint_test` case each run
    ([#737](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/737)) — which is
    what a race looks like when every case shares one teardown. **Reproduced on
    Linux** by adding the shared assertion to `~EpollListener` and delaying
    `EpollReactor::RunLoop()`'s return by 200 ms: `[frame]` aborted **20 of 20** runs
    across **13 distinct cases**, the reported signature exactly. A green run there
    is the absence of a trip, never evidence of a fix.
  - **The rule is now ASKED on every reactor, not only on IOCP.**
    `Detail::AssertTeardownIsSerialisedWithDispatch` is called from `~EpollSocket`,
    `~EpollListener`, `~KqueueSocket` and `~KqueueListener` as well as the IOCP pair,
    which is what gives the class an observer on every leg instead of one that does
    not gate. It could not be added until both owners that broke it were fixed --
    `~FrameEndpoint` (#840) and `RaftPeerServer::Shutdown`
    ([#885](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/885)) -- and the
    proof that it is a GUARD rather than decoration is that it has been watched
    refusing: with #885 alone neutered, `cluster-e2e` aborts 134 and the whole suite
    is green again with it restored.
  - **The same defect surfaced in THREE test files and was triaged as three things.**
    #737 in `FrameEndpoint_test`, #875 in `CompileResponder_test`, plus the #523 sweep
    case in #668 -- one site, `~FrameEndpoint`, and every case that builds an endpoint
    on a live `NodeIoLoop` shares it. #875's triage read *"every `IocpSocket` teardown
    CASE in that run passed, so #737's signature is absent"*, which collapses **a test
    case about teardown** into **the teardown assertion firing**: the assertion text
    was in that run's log, at `IocpSocket.cpp, line 96`. **Match the ASSERTION, never
    the case that happened to be running** -- the case is what the scheduler picked,
    and picking a different one each run is the signature rather than a distinction.
  - **So the regression test does not wait for the race, it removes it.** A second
    loop that never finishes (`NoteLoopStarted` with no matching finish until the end)
    makes the reactor unable to stop, so the predicate is false from the calling thread
    for as long as the case lasts — and a fake listener records
    `TeardownIsSerialisedWithDispatch()` as it dies rather than asserting, because an
    assert aborts and can only ever be a canary. Measured: **20 of 20 fail** with the
    fix neutered, **20 of 20 pass** with it, and the three failing assertions are
    exactly the three that describe the defect.

- **A reactor resumes what it parks or FREES it -- and it may free only what nothing
  else owns.** `Stop()` sets a flag and posts a wakeup, `RunLoop()` returns with the
  timer heap and the submit queue exactly where they were, and both were destroyed as
  containers of non-owning `std::coroutine_handle<>`. Every frame parked at that moment,
  and everything reachable from it, leaked with no diagnostic
  ([#1025](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1025)). LeakSanitizer
  reports it as an **indirect-only** set -- not an oddity, a signature: nothing in the
  set is reachable from a root, because a `Task` chain refers to itself through its own
  continuations.
  - **The obvious fix is a double free, and this tree already contains the case that
    proves it.** `IReactor::Schedule` says *resume this* and BORROWS: the caller
    guarantees the frame outlives the park. `ExpiryReaper` submits `_task.Native()` and
    keeps the `Task`; `TestReactor::Stop short-circuits the loop` parks a `Task` local,
    never starts it, and destroys it BEFORE the reactor. Measured, with a blanket
    destroy in `Submit`: ASan `heap-use-after-free` on that arrangement. So the reactor
    is TOLD, per park, whether anything else can free the chain -- `ParkedWork::abandon`,
    which `Detail::ParkedWorkFor` derives from the parking coroutine's promise type and
    fills in exactly when the chain bottoms out in a `DetachedTask`. Empty is the safe
    answer and is what every direct `Submit(handle)` still gets.
  - **What is freed is the chain ROOT, never the frame the reactor is holding**, and
    the difference is the whole ticket. Ownership in a `Task` chain runs DOWNWARD --
    each frame's `Awaiter` owns the frame it awaits -- so destroying the parked frame
    runs its own destructors and stops there, leaving the caller waiting on it holding
    a dangling handle and itself unreachable. Measured on #1025's own three-frame shape:
    freeing the parked frame took a four-allocation leak to **three** and LSan stayed
    red; freeing the root took it to **zero**.
  - **Resuming instead is not the other half of a choice, it is a hang.** A bounded wait
    re-parks -- `AwaitWatchQuiet` sleeps in 5 ms steps up to 1250 ms -- so a drain that
    resumes spins for the rest of the window on a real clock and never terminates on a
    `ManualClock`. It would also run connection bodies, which can suspend again on a
    socket, on whatever thread is tearing the reactor down. `destroy()` runs destructors
    and creates no new work, which is why it is the verb.
  - **The release is FOLDED into the resume**, per `ReadSlot.hpp`'s rule about which
    shape a guard takes: `Detail::Parked::Resume()` disowns and resumes in one
    expression, so no fire path has a line to forget it on, and a container that is
    simply cleared frees exactly the chains nothing else can. Shown red by resuming
    WITHOUT disowning: ASan `heap-use-after-free` on the elapsed-timer case alone.
  - **Both containers, and IOCP's submissions are the exception that had to be stated.**
    A posted completion packet is held by the kernel and there is no entry to fold the
    ownership into -- the same fact `CancelPending` reports by answering `false` there --
    so `IocpReactor` keeps a side table reconciled at the ONE place a
    `KeyResumeCoroutine` packet is dequeued. That is the only reactor with a forget site
    rather than a folded one, and it is why it has one.
  - **Derived rather than listed**: `Submit(ParkedWork)` and `Schedule(TimePoint,
    ParkedWork)` are pure virtual, so a fifth backend is handed the question instead of
    inheriting the defect by omission, and `ParkedWork_test.cpp` runs every property
    against `TestReactor` AND `PlatformReactor`, which is epoll, IOCP or kqueue
    depending on which leg is running it.
  - **Shown red six ways, each failing its own cases and only those** -- which is the
    asymmetry [`testing.md`](testing.md) asks for, and the reason a single neutering
    would not have been enough. Free nothing: the three abandonment cases fail and the
    three resume cases stay green. Name the parked frame rather than the root: only the
    chain case fails. Free whatever is held: only the borrowed case fails, as a
    use-after-free. Resume without disowning: only the two resume cases fail, as
    use-after-frees. Drop rather than free what cannot be resumed, and free during member
    destruction rather than in the destructor body: one case each, the second as a
    use-after-free.
  - **A parked entry that cannot RESUME must FREE, and taking the work out before
    deciding is how that gets lost.** `Parked::Resume()` disowns first -- which is what
    stops a completed body being freed twice -- so an early return on `handle.done()`
    discards an owned root without destroying it: a silent leak on the one path the type
    exists to close. Nothing reaches it through a reactor, because a chain whose
    `abandon` is set is owned by nobody and so cannot have been resumed to completion by
    anything else; it is driven at the primitive, which is the honest place for a branch
    that exists for the contract rather than for a caller.
  - **Freeing during MEMBER destruction is not the same as freeing in the destructor
    BODY**, and `TestReactor` is where that distinction bites. Members die in reverse
    declaration order, so one parked container outlives the other -- and freeing a chain
    RE-ENTERS the reactor, because a frame holding a `DeadlineTimer` runs `Disarm()` into
    `CancelPending`, which searches BOTH containers. A chain freed from the later one
    then reads storage the earlier has released, which is a `heap-use-after-free` and not
    a leak. The platform reactors have a destructor for two reasons and only the first is
    closing descriptors; the double owns none, which says WHEN its body must run rather
    than that it needs none. Also why the freeing happens OUTSIDE the lock: the
    re-entrant `CancelPending` takes the same mutex.
  - **The teardown loops rather than walking its containers once**, because freeing a
    chain can park again -- and it is MEASURED, on `EpollReactor`, which is the only
    subject that can show it. The single pass does not LOSE the re-parked entry, it frees
    it LATER, and later is member destruction: after the destructor body's `::close`
    calls. So the difference is no leak and no number any container reports -- it is
    whether a descriptor was still open at the moment a chain died. A probe in the
    re-parked frame calls `Attach()` (`epoll_ctl` on `_epollFd`, the call `~EpollSocket`
    reaches through `Detach()`) and records the answer WITH its errno. Delete the `while`
    and it reports **EBADF** while a control chain freed on the first pass is unmoved at
    yes -- the asymmetry, not the red. The errno is what rules out the reading the ticket
    was filed for: a reused descriptor number answering yes for the wrong reason would be
    `EINVAL`, and nothing here opens a descriptor between those closes and the member
    destruction that follows them
    ([#1054](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1054)).
  - **The case it replaces could not fail because it was written against the DOUBLE**,
    and the transferable part is not *use a real reactor*. `TestReactor` owns no
    descriptors, so it has no later moment differing from the earlier one and the single
    pass is genuinely benign there; the case passed with the loop and without it and was
    deleted rather than kept. **A behaviour whose only trace is a RESOURCE needs a
    subject that holds one** -- a double chosen for being deterministic can be
    deterministic about nothing. It also says what the prose said instead: *no fixture
    stages that deterministically* stood here for a while, which is the shape
    [`build-and-toolchain.md`](build-and-toolchain.md) warns about, an entry instructing
    the next session not to try.
  - **Kqueue and IOCP run the same loop and have no such case, and the obvious port is
    VACUOUS on one of them.** `IocpReactor::AttachHandle` is a true equivalent: it calls
    `CreateIoCompletionPort` against `_iocp`, which `~IocpReactor` sets to `nullptr`
    after closing. `KqueueReactor::Attach` is not, and its signature says nothing about
    that -- `[[nodiscard]] bool Attach(KqueueFdHandler*) const noexcept` on both, and the
    kqueue one makes no kernel call at all, returning `handler->fd >= 0 && _kq >= 0`
    while `~KqueueReactor` closes `_kq` WITHOUT resetting it. So the same probe answers
    yes in both builds there and passes for no reason; kqueue's equivalent question is
    `UpdateInterest`, which does call `kevent`. Asserted from the signatures and caught
    by reading the bodies, which is the whole lesson: **an equivalent is a call that
    ASKS the kernel, not a member with a matching declaration.** Measured on one reactor
    of three and code-read on two, the same split as the bullet below.
  - **A reactor's owner is now required to outlive the frames it abandons**, and nothing
    enforces it. `RunSingleReactor` declares its reactor FIRST so it is destroyed LAST --
    which it must be, since the servers and listeners hold references to it -- so
    abandoned connection frames are now destroyed after `servers`, `expiryPool` and the
    per-bind `TlsContext` are gone. It is safe as written: what such a frame's death
    touches is its own socket, whose `Close()` reaches only the reactor, and
    `IAdmissionControl::OnConnectionEnded` is on the `co_return` path a destroyed frame
    does not run. Before this change those frames were never destroyed at all, so the
    requirement is new; it is written where the reactor is declared.
  - Epoll was MEASURED, end to end and under LSan. IOCP and kqueue share the shape and
    were code-read; the Windows leg builds and runs the same cases against `IocpReactor`.
- **A derived interface that re-declares ONE overload HIDES every other overload of that
  name from its base**, and here it hid the one that carries ownership. `IReactor`
  re-declared `Submit(std::coroutine_handle<>)` and never re-declared
  `IExecutor::Submit(ParkedWork)`, so through an `IReactor&` -- which is what every
  parking site in this tree holds -- only the BORROWING overload existed. The seven
  `Submit(handle)` sites of
  [#1041](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1041) did not neglect to
  hand ownership over: **they could not**, and the call each of them wrote bound to the
  overload that drops what it is given. `Schedule` declares both, which is precisely why
  `SleepUntil` could hand ownership over and nothing that submits could -- one interface,
  two verbs, opposite outcomes, and nothing at either call site says which you got.
  - **Silent in both directions, and it is name lookup working rather than failing.**
    Lookup stops at the first scope that has the name, so the derived declaration is
    legal, every call still compiles, and the one selected is the wrong one. Adding an
    overload to a BASE therefore reaches no caller holding the derived type, and nothing
    warns -- which is why the hole survived #1025, the change that created the overload.
  - **The detection is the compiler, once the overload is reachable.** Convert the call
    sites to pass the owning type and build: every site that had been binding to the
    hidden overload fails `no viable conversion`, and **the set of those errors IS the
    reach of the defect**. That is a measurement rather than a census, so unlike a grep
    it cannot be narrower than its author reads it -- the census that opened this ticket
    said seven, and the compiler is what confirmed seven rather than agreeing with it.
    Re-declare the overload (or `using Base::Name;`) and they compile again, which is the
    ACCEPTING direction and the one a guard nobody has watched accept does not have.
  - **Restoring the overload re-binds nothing that already compiled.** A caller passing a
    `coroutine_handle<>` still selects the handle overload, so the repair cannot silently
    change an existing call -- worth stating, because the fear that it might is exactly
    what argues for leaving the hole open.

- **A watchdog may not write to a socket a coroutine owns, and the reason is
  OWNERSHIP rather than interleaving.** `FrameServer::CloseOverdue` closes connections
  past their deadline, so a peer got a bare TCP close it cannot tell from a crash, a
  drop, or a refusal it never received. The obvious repair — have the sweeper send a
  named refusal first — has an obvious objection and a decisive one, and only the
  decisive one survives contact with a fix. The obvious objection is interleaving:
  `ServeConnection` performs seven `WriteAll` calls across its loop, so a second writer
  splices a refusal into somebody's answer, which is the crossed-reply hazard of
  [`distributed-compilation.md`](distributed-compilation.md) reached from the OUTPUT
  side. That is true, and it invites the wrong fix — a write lock — because it reads
  as a synchronisation problem. **The decisive objection is that the socket lives in
  `ServeConnection`'s coroutine frame (`std::unique_ptr<ISocket> owned`) and the
  sweeper's table holds a bare pointer.** A `co_await socket->Write(...)` in the
  sweeper holds that pointer across a suspension the connection can complete and
  destroy through, so it is a use-after-free that **any amount of interlocking leaves
  in place**. A lock there is a second bug wearing a fix's clothes.
  - **So the sweep asks WHERE the connection is parked, and the two answers differ in
    kind.** Parked on the socket — dribbling a header, dribbling a declared payload,
    pushing out a reply — nothing but the close ends it, and the close is the write
    side gone: it is closed, and told nothing. Parked inside the responder, the close
    wakes nothing at all (the compile runs to completion, hops home, and its
    `WriteAll` fails — `IFrameResponder::RequestTimeout` had already recorded this),
    the write side is idle, and the coroutine comes back on its own. There the entry
    is MARKED and left open, and the connection writes its own refusal when `Answer`
    returns.
  - **"Explainable" therefore means parked in the surface, never "has named a verb".**
    The wider phrasing is the one that reads well and silently promises the
    payload-dribble case, which cannot be honoured without a read-side half-close on
    `ISocket` — and `SHUT_RD` waking a pending IOCP `WSARecv` is not the same story as
    epoll. State the narrow rule; a clause delivered at 80% closes a ticket over a
    surviving gap.
  - **The observation point is ONE line — after `Answer` returns — and that is the
    whole reason this is safe.** A "check whether you were swept before writing" rule
    at each of seven write sites is a rule to forget at the eighth. Here it is a
    consequence of where the mark can be set at all, so exactly one writer is
    structural rather than agreed.
  - **A deferral needs its own bound, and that bound is DERIVED from the responder's
    own window — never a constant.** `Answer` is an interface and nothing can promise
    it returns, so leaving the socket open would hold a descriptor for the life of the
    process where the old close released it; `ExplanationGraceFor` closes it after all.
    It shipped once as a flat `SweepInterval * 4`, which is five seconds, against a
    `CompileResponder::RequestTimeout` of six hundred — **a factor of 120**. A TU that
    has just outrun a ten-minute grant does not return inside five seconds, so the
    deferral expired, the socket closed, and nothing was owed when `Answer` came back:
    the fix explained itself reliably on the cache surface, where the problem is mild,
    and silently not at all on the compile surface it was written for. The constant's
    own justification — *"a property of this mechanism and not of a site's workload"* —
    sat three hundred lines below `IFrameResponder::RequestTimeout` arguing that **one
    number cannot bound both things this endpoint carries**, and pure virtual precisely
    so no surface can inherit five seconds. The general form: **a duration this endpoint
    applies to a responder's work belongs to the responder**, and a constant is how it
    silently stops applying to the surface that needed it most. The connection SLOT is
    held by the coroutine frame either way, so the close was only ever buying one
    descriptor.
  - **And the case that proves the fix could not see it.** The integration test used a
    50 ms window and released its hold at once, so it never approached the grace. Nor is
    the magnitude cheap to assert: the sweep fires at `RequestTimeout` and the grace is
    derived from that same number, so discriminating the old constant needs a window
    above five seconds and a hold between the two — sixteen-plus seconds, measured
    through sleeps whose spread is the quantity. So the grace is a **pure function**
    over the window, pinned on both sides, which is the testing rules' preference
    applied to exactly the situation they describe.
  - **Two counters, two events.** `FrameAnswerDeadlineSweeps` keeps its exact meaning
    (a sweep happened) so nothing scraping it breaks; `FrameDeadlineRefusalsSent` says
    how many of those peers were told why, moved by the connection when the write
    SUCCEEDS. The gap between them is a real quantity — swept peers left to infer it —
    rather than an error term, and a peer that had already hung up belongs in it.
- **An awaitable's address is taken in `await_suspend`, never in the function that
  returns it.** A factory like `Accept()` or `Read()` builds the awaitable as a LOCAL
  and returns it by value, so the object the caller suspends on is a different one;
  the address of the local names storage that is gone before anything can complete
  through it. `InMemorySocket::Read` had this right and wrote down why -- *"at that
  point `self` is the awaitable living in the awaiting coroutine's frame, not this
  local"* -- and `InMemoryListener::Accept` two hundred lines away did
  `_pendingAwaitable = &awaitable;` instead
  ([#734](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/734)). Both `Close`
  and `TryCompletePendingAccept` then completed through it. `SetSuspendCallback` is
  the seam that makes the right answer the only reachable one, which is why every
  other awaitable in that file uses it.
  - **It was latent for a reason that expired.** Every case in that file used the lazy
    `Task` shape and reached `Shutdown()` before anything suspended, so the parked
    path was never taken and the dangling pointer never dereferenced. #712's detached
    pump made eager, parking coroutines an ordinary shape in this tree, which is what
    turns a dormant trap into one somebody walks into. A fake that faults only under a
    shape nobody has used yet is a trap set for whoever uses it first.
  - **Reproduced before it was fixed**, and it is not a subtle failure once reached:
    an eager `DetachedTask` parked on `Accept` followed by `Close()` is a **SIGSEGV**,
    caught by Catch2 as a fatal error condition. Two cases, because `Close` and
    `TryCompletePendingAccept` are two call sites and fixing one would leave the other
    reading freed storage -- plus a control on the QUEUED path, since an
    implementation that resolved every accept synchronously would satisfy both while
    never parking at all.
  - **Third in a family found in one week**, and the family is the point: a fake more
    PERMISSIVE than the thing it stands for. `InMemorySocket::Close` did not retrieve
    a parked read where `EpollSocket::Close` always had; `InMemoryPageStore` modelled
    behaviour the real store no longer has; this one holds a pointer no reactor socket
    would. `testing.md`'s *a test fake is a shared helper too* is the general rule --
    what these add is that the divergence is always in the direction that lets MORE
    through, because a fake is written to satisfy the callers that exist.

- **A parked read is retrieved by `Close()` and by nothing else, so the FAKE has to
  do it too.** `EpollSocket::Close` has always detached its parked awaitables and
  completed them with `Cancelled`; `InMemorySocket::Close` -- the socket every test in
  this tree runs on -- cleared its pipe's progress callback and walked away, which
  makes the abandonment final: nothing left can complete that awaitable, so the
  awaiting coroutine is never resumed and its frame is never freed. Found by asking
  what happens to #712's new detached pump when a `TlsSocket` is destroyed mid-wait,
  and it is the shared-fake rule from [`testing.md`](testing.md) arriving from the
  other direction: a fake nothing exercises does not report its own bugs. It went
  unseen because the in-memory `Read` only parks when the peer has neither written nor
  closed, which most fixtures avoid by construction -- and because before #712 a TLS
  `WaitReadable` delegated to that fake, which answers synchronously, so nothing ever
  parked there at all.
  - **The instrument was proved before the result was believed.** LeakSanitizer
    reports an abandoned coroutine frame as a DIRECT leak naming the coroutine
    function and exits non-zero; a control that parks and then RESUMES is clean.
    Measured on clang 22.1.8 / Linux x86-64 with a two-armed standalone program,
    because "the suite is green under ASan" is not evidence about a leaked frame until
    something has been watched leaking one. This is not the size-dependent case the
    `*View` rule records: that one is use-after-free, where a freed block nothing
    disturbs reads back correctly, while a leak is a live unreachable allocation and
    LSan is exact about it.
  - **The case is red TWO ways, and only one of them is an assertion.** `CHECK(resolved)`
    fails because the wait never comes back, and LSan fails the whole binary with
    1320 bytes in 4 allocations naming `PumpWaitReadable`, `DriveWaitReadable` and the
    observing task. Either alone would have been enough to notice; neither existed
    before, which is why the hole was reachable.
  - **Detach FIRST, complete LAST, touch no member after** -- `EpollSocket::Close`'s
    own rule, copied deliberately rather than re-derived, because completing resumes a
    coroutine that may own the socket and destroy it before `Complete` returns.

- **A read-slot fixture with a byte in flight tests nothing**, because both arm sites
  take a SYNCHRONOUS path first. `EpollSocket::Read` tries `recv` and
  `EpollSocket::WaitReadable` tries `recv(MSG_PEEK)` before either reaches
  `ClaimReadSlot`, so whichever call would have claimed an occupied slot returns early
  the moment there is anything to read. Measured while reproducing
  [#755](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/755): a fixture that
  sent one more command after `UNSUBSCRIBE` PASSED against the unfixed tree, and the
  same fixture with the wire left quiet aborted in `ClaimReadSlot` every time. **Keep
  the wire silent and let the parks happen**, or the case is green for the same reason
  the defect is invisible in production traffic.
  - And the ordering that produced it is worth naming on its own: `RearmReadable` ran
    immediately after `ReadOneCommand`, which is BEFORE the command is dispatched -- so
    `UNSUBSCRIBE` re-armed the watcher and only then dropped the subscription count.
    Settling a watcher belongs after the dispatch that can change what it is watching
    for, which is the top of the next iteration, where the count is final and the
    watcher is still parked on its rearm LATCH. That last clause is what lets it be
    retired by tripping a latch rather than by a socket cancellation primitive this
    tree does not have (#710) -- and it is why the re-arm now waits for the reader to
    drain, since a watcher re-armed over buffered bytes goes back into `WaitReadable`
    and out of the latch's reach.

- **A socket has ONE read operation, `Read` and `WaitReadable` share it, and the
  rule lived nowhere it could be obeyed.** Both verbs begin by claiming the same
  per-direction `awaitable` pointer, so arming either while the other is parked
  drops the parked awaitable: that coroutine is never resumed and never freed, with
  no assertion, no error and no log, and the leak is proportional to traffic on
  whatever path did it
  ([#663](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/663)). The one
  correct statement of the discipline in this tree was a comment in `RedisResp.cpp`
  about that file's own watcher -- so somebody writing the next `WaitReadable` user
  read `ISocket::WaitReadable`, which documented what the call does and said nothing
  about exclusivity, and got a leaked frame per occurrence with no signal of any
  kind. Four things are load-bearing:
  - **The rule is on `ISocket`, because that is where it must be obeyed.** A
    constraint stated by one consumer about itself is a constraint the next consumer
    never meets.
  - **The claim and the check are ONE expression.** `Detail::ClaimReadSlot`
    (`Net/ReadSlot.hpp`; core-cpp's `contract::claimReadSlot` since the move, and since
    core-cpp 0.3.0 it ends the process in EVERY build) asserts the slot is free and then
    clears it, and the six
    arm sites across `EpollSocket`, `KqueueSocket` and `IocpSocket` have no bare
    `awaitable = nullptr` left. There is no line to forget the guard on, at the
    seventh site as at the first -- the same shape as `SigningDomain` leaving no
    argument to pass a bare label to. `IocpSocket`'s destructor still assigns
    directly, and that is a teardown rather than a claim.
  - **Debug-only, and the fix for a caller that does this belongs at the CALLER --
    but the reason changed, and the old one is quoted in two places.** This bullet
    used to say that completing the dropped awaitable *"would resume a coroutine that
    may already have lost the socket it holds -- a use-after-free where there is
    currently a leak"*. That was overstated, and `ReadSlot.hpp` retracted it: the
    counter-evidence is in the same directory, because `EpollSocket::Close` and
    `KqueueSocket::Close` already detach a parked awaitable and `Complete` it with
    `Cancelled`, and they do it to `RunBlockingRead`'s own trampoline on every close
    that finds one parked. Were that a use-after-free this tree would be crashing on
    ordinary disconnects. It cost a decision before it was caught: another lane
    withdrew a cancellation primitive on the strength of it.
    - **The conclusion survives with a sound reason: the hazard is the SITE, not
      ownership.** At the ARM site the resumed coroutine runs inside `Read` with the
      slot mid-claim and is free to call `Read` again -- and, decisively, cancelling a
      trampoline whose iteration is still LIVE resolves that iteration's waiter as
      *the peer went away*, dropping a healthy client. A socket cannot tell a stale
      parked wait from a live one at arm time. **The caller can**, because it knows
      when its own iteration ended, which is why the cancel belongs there.
    - **Refusing the new operation is still wrong**, and for the reason that did not
      change: it turns a silent leak into a broken connection on a live path.
    - So `CancelRead` exists (below) and `ClaimReadSlot` only names the misuse -- by ending the
      process, in every build since core-cpp 0.3.0, where Release used to hang silently. The two
      are not alternatives: the tripwire names the misuse, the verb gives the caller
      the only spelling of *abandon* that is not `Close()`.
  - **It is watched refusing, and the hazard has no other coverage at all.** Measured
    while landing the guard: a probe at all six arm sites reported ZERO double-arms
    across `PaceTest` (2073 cases) and `pace-node-tests`, and no
    script fixture drives a blocking RESP verb or a subscription over a real socket
    -- so nothing in the suite can see this, which is the ticket's own point.
    `read-slot-guard-canary` (now core-cpp's `socket-contract-canary`) double-arms a REAL
    socket through the real reactor, so
    what it drives is the call site rather than the guard function, and
    `scripts/read-slot-guard-gate.cmake` requires the assertion's OWN words: a bare
    `WILL_FAIL` passes for a segfault, a missing library and a refused bind alike,
    which is the same argument `iterator-debug-gate.ps1` makes about the same shape.
    Shown red by removing the guard from one arm site, where it reports `the canary
    SURVIVED` rather than a bare failure.

- **The WRITE slot is the same rule, and it is enforced the same way.** One write op
  per socket per direction, so arming a `Write` over a parked one drops that coroutine
  exactly as #663's read side does. `Detail::ClaimWriteSlot` (`Net/WriteSlot.hpp`,
  [#893](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/893)) folds the claim
  and the `assert` into one expression, for the reason the read side gives: a guard
  folded INTO the operation is self-enforcing, and one called alongside it needs a
  scan. It ends the process in every build since core-cpp 0.3.0 (Debug-only before), and
  refusing the operation is wrong here for the same reason.
  - **It reaches `FrameEndpoint`'s one-writer property because `WriteAll` sends a whole
    frame in ONE `ISocket::Write`.** So a write that PARKS is a half-sent frame, and a
    second writer arming over it is a client reading a length out of the middle of
    somebody else's frame -- the pulse-versus-reply interleaving
    [`distributed-compilation.md`](distributed-compilation.md) describes. A write that
    completes inline takes no claim and needs none.
  - **Watched BOTH ways, which the read-side canary is not** -- in pace-kv until the move;
    core-cpp's `socket-contract-canary` watches both slots now.
    `ctest -R write-slot-guard-canary` drove an ordinary sequential pair of writes and
    only then the double-arm, and `scripts/write-slot-guard-gate.cmake` requires the
    acceptance marker BEFORE the abort. A guard nobody has watched refuse is not a
    guard; a guard nobody has watched ACCEPT is not known to work either (#1031) -- one
    that objected to every write would pass a refusal-only gate and surface days later
    as a different defect. That canary did not exist when `WriteSlot.hpp` first claimed
    in its own doc comment that it did, which is
    [#1218](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1218).
  - **What is still NOT enforced** is that a new helper can simply name `Loop`: the
    scan behind `EndpointWriterTable` cannot say which FUNCTION a call sits in without
    parsing bodies, so that half stays a refusal by ROW, which a reviewer sees, rather
    than a property a compiler checks.

- **A parked read is retrieved by `CancelRead`, and the caller that armed it is the
  only one who may.** `Read` and `WaitReadable` share one slot, and until #710 the
  only thing that could take a parked wait back was `Close()` -- so the caller-side
  discipline above had no spelling for *abandon* short of tearing the connection down.
  `RunBlockingRead` is the caller that could not follow it
  ([#710](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/710)): it armed a
  fresh readability watch per loop pass and cancelled none, so every pass that ended
  with the previous trampoline parked dropped that coroutine, and the blocking read's
  own exit left one for the connection loop's next `Read` to drop. One frame plus its
  `shared_ptr<StreamWaiter>` per pass, unbounded on a `BLOCK 0` reader; on IOCP the
  reused `OVERLAPPED` completes the wrong operation and reports EOF on a healthy
  connection.
  - **Re-target, do not re-arm -- and re-arm only once the previous watch has
    RESOLVED.** The loop points one `DisconnectWatch` at each pass's waiter; a fresh
    trampoline is armed only when the slot is free. "Arm once and never again" is the
    tempting simplification and it is wrong: `ArmDisconnect` ENDS deliberately on a
    non-zero count (bytes pending for the next command), re-arming after that is both
    legitimate and safe, and #673's pipelined-data case stages its whole distinction
    through that second watch -- so the simplification would leave a green test
    asserting nothing.
  - **Retiring is not disconnecting, and that is the half that reads backwards.**
    `CancelRead` completes the parked watch with an ERROR, and `ArmDisconnect` reads any
    error as a departure -- so what silences it must be the watch being RETIRED, never
    the error code. Silence it by code and a genuine abortive close stops being noticed;
    silence it by nothing and cancelling drops a healthy client.
    - **And it is UNTESTED, which is stated rather than covered.** Delete
      `DisconnectWatch::Retire()`'s body and every case still passes: at all five retire
      sites the pass's waiter is already resolved or never inspected again. It is defence
      for the IOCP timing, where the trampoline resumes on a much later turn, and for a
      future arrangement that inspects the waiter afterwards. A test asserting it would
      be green in both states -- *assert what DISTINGUISHES* -- so claiming one would be
      worse than naming the gap. The entry said "easy to get backwards", which implied
      load-bearing NOW; that is the accurate claim's weaker form and it is corrected here
      rather than only in the header, because a claim with two homes corrected once
      survives in the other.
  - **Retirement is RAII and also explicit, and the pair is deliberate.** A destructor
    covers the four exits that exist and the ones added later; the explicit calls put
    the cancel BEFORE the reply write, so the read slot is free across it rather than
    only once the frame unwinds. That reason REPLACED an earlier one -- that the
    explicit calls bought IOCP, where cancellation was asynchronous, a write round trip
    in which to dequeue the aborted completion -- which #884 made false. The practice
    outlived its reason; check which you are relying on before removing a call.
  - **Synchronous on every transport that parks a read, IOCP included, and a caller may
    arm the next read in the same turn.** That is not free on IOCP and the cost is the
    interesting part: the kernel owns a retracted operation's `OVERLAPPED` until its
    completion is dequeued, a LATER turn, so `IocpSocket` retires the waiter inline and
    stands the whole operation NODE down -- `Op::self` keeps it alive for the kernel --
    while the next read gets a fresh one.
    [#884](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/884) was leaving the
    waiter in place instead, and it was worse than the leak it looks like: the next
    `Read` zeroes `OVERLAPPED::Internal`, `IocpReactor` reads the operation's error out
    of exactly that field, so the abort dispatched as `err == 0, bytes == 0` -- a
    SPURIOUS EOF on a healthy socket whose data was still unread and whose own
    completion was then dropped. Anything that retracts an operation the kernel is
    still writing into owes the same treatment.
  - **The in-memory transport cannot stage any of this**, which is why twelve blocking
    cases were green while a coroutine leaked per connection: `InMemorySocket::WaitReadable`
    answers inline, so nothing is ever parked. `Testing::ParkingReadableSocket` parks
    the way a reactor socket does and MODELS the shared slot -- a competing arm
    ORPHANS the parked watch and is counted, rather than aborting through
    `ClaimReadSlot`, whose abort names the slot rather than the caller. Retirement by
    the caller and retirement by `Close()` are counted APART, because they are
    opposite answers about this ticket and one counter renders them the same.
  - **Shown red by neutering both halves**, per case so one `REQUIRE` cannot mask its
    siblings: `armed=2 orphaned=2` on a read that loops once, exactly the two new
    cases failing and the two controls plus every pre-existing blocking case staying
    green. The asymmetry is the evidence.
  - Epoll was MEASURED; IOCP and kqueue were code-read.

- **`Read`'s buffer must be non-empty, because `0` is already taken and it is taken
  by the OPPOSITE fact.** `0` on this interface means *the peer has finished
  sending*, and every transport computes its result from a receive primitive that
  answers `0` for a zero-length request: `recv(fd, p, 0, 0)` on all three POSIX
  backends, a zero-length `WSARecv` completing with `bytesReceived == 0`,
  `InMemorySocket::TryPull` pulling nothing. So a caller reaching `Read` with an
  empty span was told its peer closed
  ([#838](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/838)) -- **the one
  way this interface can still make the exact false claim the EOF rule above exists
  to stop anyone making by accident.** An off-by-one in a `subspan(got)`
  accumulation loop, or a decorator narrowing a chunk to zero, and the loop
  terminates cleanly on a graceful close that never happened.
  - **It belongs to the seam, not to whoever hits it.** `Net/TcpClient.cpp`'s
    `RecvExactly` had already found it and answered it locally -- *"asked for
    nothing, answered with nothing"* -- which is one consumer carrying a contract
    every consumer needs and no other consumer can see. `Detail::RequireReadBuffer`
    sits beside the sentence it enforces in `ISocket.hpp`, and the six transports
    call it as `Read`'s first statement.
  - **Programmer error, so an assertion rather than an error code.** There is no
    result a zero-byte read could return that would be true, which is this
    project's definition of contract misuse; a `NetErrorCode` for it would make
    every caller start handling a case that cannot legitimately occur.
  - **The census came FIRST, and it is what made the assertion safe to add.** The
    ticket's own acceptance put it first for that reason: an assert converts a
    silent wrong answer into a crashing suite, so *does anything read a zero-length
    span today* decides everything after it. Measured empirically rather than by
    grep -- guard in place, whole suite, **3315 of 3315 passing on `clang-debug`
    before this change registered its own tests** -- so no production path and no
    fixture passes an empty span. The count travels with what it counted, because a
    suite total is comparable only against the same tree, the same platform AND the
    same target set, and this very figure was read back stale by one within the hour.
  - **Debug-only, and the release residual is a DECISION.** With assertions
    compiled out an empty read still answers EOF. Refusing it there costs a new
    enumerator in `Net`'s taxonomy plus a behaviour change on every shipped
    transport, bought for a path the census says nothing takes. That is
    `ClaimReadSlot`'s trade above reached from the other side -- there the release
    behaviour is a leak, here it is a wrong answer -- and it is written down so it
    is weighed rather than rediscovered.
  - **Watched refusing by `empty-read-buffer-canary`**, which hands the empty span
    to a real transport (the call site, never the guard function) and must die.
    `InMemorySocket` rather than a reactor socket: a canary aborts at the first
    violation so it watches ONE site whatever it picks, and that one has no bind to
    be refused, no client thread to fail to arrive, and the same verdict on every
    platform. Shown red by removing the guard, where it reports `it answered 0 with
    7 bytes still pending` -- the defect observed, not merely a failure.
  - **A GUARD FOLDED INTO THE OPERATION IS SELF-ENFORCING; A GUARD CALLED ALONGSIDE
    ONE NEEDS A SCAN.** This is the general rule the pair of guards in this directory
    happens to demonstrate, and it decides which shape the NEXT one should take,
    which is worth more than either guard. `ClaimReadSlot` takes the slot the arm site
    must clear anyway, so the check and the operation are one expression and there is
    no line to forget it on -- the same construction as `SigningDomain` leaving no
    argument to pass a bare label to. `RequireReadBuffer` is purely ADDITIVE: it reads
    a parameter, changes nothing, and every site can therefore omit it independently.
    Prefer the folded shape when the guard can ride on something the site must do;
    when it cannot, the scan is not optional, because the alternative is a rule
    enforced by everyone having remembered.
    - **And the author of this rule broke it in the same branch, within hours.**
      `ISocket::CancelRead` landed one commit later with a default no-op inherited
      by TWO of six transports that both PARK a read -- `TlsSocket`, where
      `PumpWaitReadable` parks on a RAW read whenever OpenSSL wants more bytes, and
      `InMemorySocket`, whose `WaitReadable` never parks while its `Read` does. Both
      were #710 still live, on the very ticket that commit closed. Recorded in this
      shape deliberately: the comfortable reading of a rule broken next door is that
      it never reached the person who broke it, and here it cannot be -- **same
      author, same branch, same hours, having just written the rule down.** Whoever
      reads this and concludes *I would have noticed* is the next instance.
    - **A default that is correct for the transport you happen to be thinking about
      is the dangerous kind**, and `InMemorySocket`'s asymmetry is why this one read
      as safe. The obligation is now stated on the interface with both transports
      named, and all six the library hands out answer it in their own file --
      `BlockingSocket`'s answer is a written no-op WITH ITS REASON, which is the
      distinction that matters.
    - **A `/simplify` finding is a change like any other and is not exempt from the
      review its subject just had.** The cleanup that removed the hiding place created
      the bug: the change moving every offset in `check-read-buffer-guard` into ONE
      coordinate system was made precisely because an earlier off-by-one had hidden in
      the three-origin arithmetic, and it left the cursor advance summing one term twice
      -- over-advancing by a whole signature, so the walk SKIPPED any second definition
      in a file. A false pass, in the instrument built to prevent false passes. **It
      arrived after the four passes that would have caught it and before the correctness
      pass that did**, which is the actionable half: a cleanup applied late lands in the
      one window where nothing is looking, and it arrives wearing the authority of a
      review rather than the suspicion of a change.
    - **And a regression test can fail to reproduce its regression.** Six self-test cases
      could not structurally see that bug -- each is a single implementation at offset
      zero, so an over-advancing cursor still lands past the only match. Case 7 is two
      implementations in one file with the second unguarded, and its PADDING is
      load-bearing rather than realism: with both at the top of the file the over-advance
      lands INSIDE the second signature and the check finds it anyway. It asserts both
      that the refusal names the second class and that both were SEEN, because a refusal
      counting one of two is right by accident.
    - **Pure virtual was proposed for it and rejected, and the reason generalises:
      reach for the type system when the obligation is DO SOMETHING; reach for a
      scan when the obligation is SAY WHY.** `ClaimReadSlot` and `SigningDomain` are
      the first kind -- there is nothing to say, only a thing to do -- which is why
      the analogy felt right and was not. A pure virtual would compel seven test
      doubles to write `{}` with no reason beside it, which is *forgot* spelled in
      the vocabulary of *decided*: `RefuseWithoutCounter`'s own argument, pointed at
      the proposal that invoked it. The scan is
      [#892](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/892).
  - **And a canary watching one site is not coverage of six**, which is the trap an
    additive guard sets and a folded one does not. **A canary aborts at the FIRST
    violation, so it watches ONE site whatever it picks -- and which site is an
    accident of ordering.** Measured, twice and independently:
    with the call deleted from `EpollSocket::Read`, the transport every Linux
    deployment reads through, **the canary PASSES and the whole suite is green**.
    That is #492's shape one level down: exact about the site it knows, silent about
    the five it does not. `read-buffer-guard` closes it, and three things about it
    are load-bearing. It **derives** the set (`Net/*.cpp`, every definition of the
    signature) rather than tabulating six paths, so a seventh transport is caught by
    construction rather than by somebody adding a row. It requires the call to stand
    **before the body's first `return`**, because all six open with
    `if (_closed) return ...` and a guard that drifts below that arm is skipped while
    a presence-only scan reads green. And it reads whole files with `file(READ)` and
    walks them with `FIND`/`SUBSTRING` rather than splitting a list, because C++ is
    full of `[[nodiscard]]` and a bracket merges two elements silently (#518) --
    `check-tsan-scope`'s answer, for the same reason its remedy could not be the
    usual one. It runs on every platform because it reads TEXT, so a Linux run covers
    the Windows and macOS transports; `read-buffer-guard-selftest` drives six
    synthesised trees, including both emptiness refusals, which are different
    questions and neither implies the other.

- **A wait that cannot be cancelled is a frame that cannot be freed, so `Schedule`
  grew a counterpart.** `IReactor` could park a coroutine on a deadline and had no
  way to take it back, which is why `DeadlineTimer` and `InterruptibleSleepUntil`
  poll in bounded steps rather than parking once: a disarmed timer then retires at
  its next tick instead of never. What that still leaves is a frame parked *during*
  the tick, and a reactor destroyed in that window frees nothing --
  `IReactor::Run` returns with its timer heap exactly as it was, deliberately. One
  leaked coroutine frame **per dial and per cache exchange**, harmless in a daemon
  that outlives them and fatal for `pace-cc`, where an ASan build then exits
  non-zero and turns every cached compile into a failed one.
  `IReactor::CancelPending` closes it: `Disarm()` takes the timer's own handle back
  off the reactor and destroys it there and then. Five things are load-bearing:
  - **The return value is an ownership transfer, not a status.** `true` means THIS
    call removed the handle, so the caller is now the only one who may resume it;
    `false` means the reactor still has it -- running, or already queued -- and the
    caller must not touch it. That is what makes the race against a timer firing
    concurrently decidable instead of a guess, and it is decided under the same lock
    the timer heap is popped under.
  - **The frame is DESTROYED, not resumed, and that is the difference between
    fixing the leak and moving it.** Resuming only queues it, and the caller that
    disarms is typically about to stop the reactor on its very next line --
    `ReactorExchange` does exactly that -- so the queued handle would never run. The
    first version resumed, and ASan reported the same leak in the same place.
  - **`DeadlineTimer` had to stop awaiting a nested `Task`.** Awaiting one parks the
    INNER coroutine's handle, so the handle the timer recorded would not be the one
    `CancelPending` has to name. Its wait is written out against `SleepUntil`
    directly, and the handle is captured by an awaitable whose `await_suspend`
    returns `false` -- recorded on the way past, without suspending, so it is
    available even in the window before the first hop onto the reactor. It is also
    what makes destroying it sound: the handle is the whole chain, and a
    `DetachedTask` leaves no awaiter holding it.
  - **The first attempt was for the reactor to free what it still held at teardown,
    and it is unsound.** `Submit` and `Schedule` convey no ownership: a `Task` local
    in a test parks its handle and then destroys its own frame at scope exit, so the
    reactor -- destroyed afterwards -- destroyed it a second time. ASan named it
    immediately, which is the argument for the sanitizer fix below in one line.
  - **IOCP cancels timers and not submissions**, because a submission there is a
    completion packet already posted to the kernel and no call takes one back. It
    answers `false` for that case, which is the honest answer under the rule above.

- **A struct returned BY VALUE from a decoder must not borrow from what it decoded.**
  `DecodeCapacity(EncodeCapacity(x))` is the obvious spelling and was a
  use-after-free the moment `CapacityFields` grew one `string_view` member: the
  encoded buffer dies at the semicolon and the view outlives it. Nothing in the type
  warned anybody -- `RegisterView` says "View" precisely because it borrows, while
  `CapacityFields` is used for both directions and reads as a value, so a borrowing
  member turned every existing call site into a trap without a single name changing.

  The decode side of a value-returning record **owns** its bytes. A registration is
  once per node; the copy is free, and the alternative is a hazard in a header every
  binary compiles.
  - **It passed on libstdc++ and failed on libc++**, which is the whole difficulty:
    the read only misbehaves once something reuses the freed block, and which
    allocator does that promptly is a property of the platform. A local ASan run
    reproduces it only if the test *churns the heap* between the decode and the read
    -- without that, ASan reports nothing and the bug looks absent.
  - **The regression test decodes from a temporary on purpose**, and a second one
    scopes the buffer and reads every field after it is gone. A rule this shape
    cannot be left to a case that happens to exercise it.
  - **It happened twice, and the second time nobody was warned either.**
    `CompileResult` and `CodecEnvelope` in `CompileCacheWire.hpp` were the same
    shape -- returned by value from a decoder, borrowing what they decoded -- and
    neither name said so ([#366](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/366)).
    `CompileResult` reached four borrowing members before anyone counted; #280 added
    the fourth.

    **They got different answers, decided per type rather than by uniformity.**
    `DecodeCompileResult` now returns an owning `CompileResultFields`, because
    `Dispatch` holds a decoded reply across statements and hands the object onward;
    the encode side keeps the name `CompileResult` and its spans, since borrowing an
    INPUT is safe and is what every encode-side struct there does. `CodecEnvelope`
    became `CodecEnvelopeView` and still borrows, because **every** consumer reads it
    in scope and its `Identity` branch in `OpenAs` hands `bytes` straight to the
    caller's container -- owning would reinstate precisely the "second full copy of a
    preprocessed translation unit, on the path least able to afford it" that the
    comment there exists to prevent. The question to ask is per type: does anything
    depend on this not copying, and does the result outlive the buffer in practice.
    Both shapes satisfy the rule; what the rule forbids is borrowing while saying
    nothing.

    The tell was already in the tree: `WorkerProtocol_test.cpp` carried **two**
    hand-rolled workarounds -- a `FieldOf` that copied the span out, and an
    `ObjectField` that mirrored `CodecEnvelope` with an owning `bytes` and a comment
    explaining the dangle. Somebody hit this, understood it, and solved it locally
    twice rather than at the type. `FieldOf`'s copy is gone, because that type owns
    now. `ObjectField` stays, and the difference is the point: it returns outward
    from a helper whose buffer dies with the call, so a local copy is the right
    answer against a type that borrows BY DESIGN. A workaround against an unlabelled
    hazard is evidence the type is wrong; the same code against a `*View` is just a
    caller doing what the name told it to.
  - **Detectability depends on the SIZE of the payload, not only on heap churn.**
    Measured while fixing #366: a four-byte object decoded from a temporary reads
    back correctly under ASan even when the member borrows, and reports nothing. The
    same case at 64 KiB is reported immediately. So a regression test for this rule
    that uses short literals is a test that cannot fail -- which is how it would be
    written by anybody tidying one up. The sizes in
    `CompileCacheWire_test.cpp` are load-bearing and say so.
  - **It happened a THIRD time, and the per-type question is a CONJUNCTION.**
    `Distributed::CallerContext::peerId` was a `std::string_view` in a type whose
    name promised nothing
    ([#395](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/395)). Ask both
    halves -- does every consumer read it in scope, AND does something depend on this
    not copying -- because one clause false is not a tie. This type satisfied the
    first, and measuring the second killed it: the figures live on `CallerContext`
    itself, in `SchedulerService.hpp`, and are not restated here so there is one row
    to read and one place to correct.

    **What the borrowed field DECIDES outranks that arithmetic**, and it is what
    settled this one. A wrong `CapacityFields` is a wrong number. A wrong `peerId` is
    a **membership decision read from freed memory** -- it is the kernel's peer host
    and admission is judged from it -- so the two mistakes are not commensurable and
    the nanoseconds do not get a vote. Where a borrowed field feeds a trust boundary,
    own it and skip the benchmark.
  - **A correctly-SIZED regression test in the wrong ARRANGEMENT still reports
    nothing**, which is the half of the size rule above that #395 nearly died of. Its
    ticket concluded the defect could not be tested at all, and the reason was
    arrangement rather than impossibility:
    - Constructed and read in ONE expression -- `Use(Make(x))` -- **nothing dangles
      at any size**, because a by-value parameter lives to the end of the full
      expression. That is how a test gets written, and it passes under the defect.
    - STORE the value, drop the source, churn the freed storage, then read. Now the
      size decides *which* check fires rather than whether one does: inside
      libstdc++'s 15-character SSO buffer it is `stack-use-after-scope`, visible only
      with ASan's stack poisoning, and past it the buffer is on the heap and it is
      `heap-use-after-free`, caught with no ASan options at all.

    So pick a size that is REAL rather than merely large, and `static_assert` it: the
    36-character peer in `SchedulerService_test.cpp` is what `getpeername` returns on
    any IPv6 deployment, which makes the case that exposes this the ORDINARY one --
    the suite had simply only ever been run against v4 loopback.
  - **A deleted overload IS probeable, but only from a dependent context**, and
    getting this wrong is easy. `static_assert(!requires { Decode(Encode(x)) })`
    written at namespace scope with concrete types is a **hard error** on MSVC,
    Clang and GCC alike: a non-dependent requires-expression checks its requirements
    immediately, and there is no substitution for the failure to be a *substitution*
    failure. Lift it into a template and it works everywhere:

    ```cpp
    template <class T> concept Decodable = requires(T&& t) { Decode(std::forward<T>(t)); };
    static_assert(Decodable<std::vector<std::byte>&>);   // named buffer: fine
    static_assert(!Decodable<std::vector<std::byte>>);   // temporary: rejected
    ```

    That is the mechanism the ranges poison pills rely on, and `std::is_invocable`
    reports `false` for a deleted candidate on the same basis. Measured on all three
    compilers in both forms before this was written down, because the first version
    of this bullet claimed the property was untestable and was simply wrong.

    No decoder here carries such an overload, and the reason is **not** testability:
    the ten `*View` types all have the same trap, so guarding one would be
    inconsistent, and it would reject three existing call sites that use the
    spelling *safely* inside a single full expression. If it is ever added it should
    be added to all of them at once.

- **No completion port is ever drained from several threads**, on Windows or anywhere
  else. The reason (it was `IocpReactor.hpp`'s, before #1596): a second thread dequeuing the same port
  migrates a coroutine across threads mid-suspension, which every awaitable here is
  written against. `RunMultiReactorWindows` therefore runs **one thread per reactor**,
  exactly as the POSIX path does — `--threads N` is N independent single-threaded
  reactors each owning its own port, never N threads sharing one.
  - **`AGENT.md` claimed the opposite until
    [#896](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/896), and that is the
    reason this bullet exists rather than only the corrected sentence.** A wrong
    sentence in `AGENT.md` is worse than a stale one, twice over: it is the document a
    session reads FIRST and is told to obey, so it *licenses* the defect — a reader
    writing a second drainer is following instructions — and it changes how a reader
    **grades** a concurrency bug, because a race the top-level design document
    describes as intended reads as a detail rather than as a violation. Neither cost
    is paid by a stale sentence about something a reader can go and check.
  - **The one `ThreadPoolExecutor { 1 }` on each of the three serving paths is the
    EXPIRY SWEEP**, and stating that is load-bearing: it is the only second thread
    visible near a reactor on those paths, so a reader counting threads finds it and
    concludes the port is shared. It drains no completion port, and it overlaps no
    `fsync` with anything — see `## The active expiry cycle` below for what it does do,
    including the one-cycle-per-daemon, reactor-0 rule.
  - **The claim is about the PORT, not about the process.** A daemon on a multi-core
    host is multi-threaded by default (`--threads` unset is `hardware_concurrency()`,
    which is what makes the `ShardedStorage` wrap the default rather than an opt-in —
    `AGENT.md`'s `## Project Architecture`). Threads are not the hazard; two of them on
    one `GetQueuedCompletionStatus` are.

## Keyspace events for what nobody asked for

<!-- agent-tripwire: A missing keyspace event has two ends -->

`expired` and `evicted` are the two keyspace events no verb handler can fire,
because no verb is executing when they happen. The path that produces them —
tier records, `NotifyingStorage` drains, `RedisMutationObserver` publishes —
has four constraints, and every one of them was a defect first.

- **Naming the victim at the tier is necessary and not sufficient.** For as long
  as `MutationKind::Expire` and `::Evict` existed, the obvious reading was that
  the storage layer's silence was the whole problem. It was not:
  `RedisMutationObserver::DescriptorFor` was a stub returning an empty
  descriptor for *every* kind and the observer held no notifier, so a named
  victim would still have published nothing. Whenever an event is missing, check
  both ends before changing either.
- **Publish only for the kinds no handler covers.** `RedisResp.cpp` already fires
  verb-specific events for everything a client asked for. A second publish at the
  storage layer puts two `__keyevent@0__:*` frames on the wire per write, which
  every existing subscriber sees as a behaviour change. That is why most rows of
  `EventTable` are deliberately empty — and it is a table, so the next kind is a
  row rather than a condition somebody has to remember to add.
- **A reclaim is reported BEFORE the call that caused it, because they can name
  the same key.** `ADD k` on a lapsed TTL reclaims `k` inside the lookup and then
  re-creates it. Drained at scope exit, that reads as `set k` then `expired k`,
  and a subscriber concludes a live key is gone. `Notify` drains first; the scope
  guard is only the backstop for calls that report nothing (a failed `DEL` on an
  expired key, a strict-LRU `Get`).
- **The recording gate and the publishing gate must agree.** The tiers copy a
  victim's key only when `IStorageMutationObserver::HasObservers()` says somebody
  is listening, so an observer that answered for WATCHers alone would leave a
  daemon with subscribers and no WATCHers publishing nothing — nothing would ever
  have been recorded to publish. `WouldPublish` likewise has to test `K`/`E` and
  not just the class bit: `notify-keyspace-events: A` names every class and no
  channel, and publishes nothing at all.

And one that is about the cache rather than the wire:

- **In a layered cache no single tier's eviction is total, so none is reported.**
  L1 dropping an entry is a demotion — the key is still in L2 and the next read
  serves it. L2 dropping one leaves the key in the L1 mirror, which `Get` answers
  without ever consulting L2, and L1 is exactly where it will be, because L1
  absorbing the hits is what left L2's recency stale enough to evict it. Erasing
  from L1 to make the event true would throw a hot key out of RAM to justify a
  notification. An *expiry* is total — both tiers hold the same TTL — so
  `LayeredStorage` forwards expiries to L2 and swallows its evictions.

## The active expiry cycle

<!-- agent-tripwire: A reclaimer nothing constructs is the bug it was written to fix -->

`ExpiryReaper` is the only thing that calls `IStorage::PurgeExpired` in
production, and for a long time nothing did — which made every rule below a
consequence rather than a precaution.

- **A reclaimer that nothing constructs is the bug it was written to fix.**
  `PurgeExpired` existed, was correct, was tested, and had no production caller,
  so expiry was entirely access-driven: with the default `Approximate` LRU a read
  does not reclaim either, and a key that lapsed and was never touched again kept
  its bytes and its byte-budget contribution until eviction happened to reach it,
  publishing no `expired` event for exactly the case a subscriber subscribes for.
  Assert the wiring, not only the mechanism — `Detail::StartExpiryCycle` is
  exposed for no other reason.
- **Sweep the chain the engine writes through, not a tier below it.** The reaper
  is handed `engine.Storage()`, which is the `NotifyingStorage`. Pointed one layer
  down it would free the bytes and publish nothing — half the bug left in place,
  and invisible to every storage-level test, because the tiers *do* record into
  the reclaim log either way. Nothing drains it.
- **One cycle per daemon, not one per reactor.** The sweep takes each shard's
  exclusive lock in turn, so a second cycle contends with the first for no gain.
  It runs on reactor 0, and its owner is declared after the reactors and before
  the acceptor threads: destroyed while the timer wheel it parked on still exists,
  and after every thread that could resume it has been joined.
- **The reclaim ceiling lives below `ReclaimLog::DefaultCapacity`, and is
  `static_assert`ed against it.** A sweep permitted to reclaim more keys at once
  than the log holds discards the `expired` events it runs to produce, and counts
  them in `pace_keyspace_reclaim_events_dropped_total`. The failure would be
  a metric nobody reads, not a symptom.
- **A bounded sweep must resume, not restart.** Each tier keeps a cursor and
  `ShardedStorage` rotates its starting shard, because a budget smaller than the
  shard count is spent before the loop reaches the far ones. Without both, a cache
  larger than one budget never expires anything past its own prefix. The cursor
  outlives the call that produced it, which makes **every** erase a place it can
  dangle: one erase point per tier (`EraseAt`, `EraseNode`) is what keeps that
  fix-up in one place, and without it MSVC's debug iterators abort the process.
- **`completedPass` is what separates "nothing left" from "out of budget",** and
  only the first may back off. A pass that stopped early has entries it has not
  looked at yet.
- **Zero means opposite things in the two knobs, and both are load-bearing.**
  `--expiry-interval=0s` disables the cycle, which is a real thing to ask for, and
  a disabled cycle is a coroutine that *ends* rather than one parked forever on a
  deadline nothing will move. `--expiry-scan=0` is what `PurgeBudget` spells as
  *no ceiling* — sweep the whole keyspace under the shard lock — so it is refused.
- **The reaper's options are baked in at construction, so they are immutable
  across a reload.** Accepting a SIGHUP that changes them would leave
  `reloader.Current()` reporting an interval the daemon is not sweeping at.

## Reclaiming on the disk tier

<!-- agent-tripwire: On disk a read may not reclaim and a write must -->

- **A read may not reclaim; a write must.** `CowTreeStorage::Get` and `Peek`
  reject a lapsed record without erasing it, because a read can be holding nothing
  but a shared lock and opening a write transaction there would break CowTree's
  single-writer contract. Every write verb holds the exclusive lock, so the rule
  never applied to them — and for as long as they were lumped in with the reads,
  the same client sequence produced a different event stream depending on
  `--storage`, and the dead bytes stayed on disk until a sweep or a `DELETE`
  reached them. `AcceptLiveRecord` is the one spelling of that question, so the
  reclaim cannot be remembered at four sites and forgotten at a fifth.
- **Reporting without erasing would have been worse than neither.** The record
  stays, so the next `APPEND`/`INCR`/CAS on the same lapsed key fires `expired`
  again. The erase is what makes the event true exactly once.

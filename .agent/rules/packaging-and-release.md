# Packaging and releasing

Rules for `packaging/`, `cmake/Packaging.cmake`, `cmake/Version.cmake` and the
release half of `.github/workflows/build.yml`, plus how a release is actually cut.

Read this before touching an install rule, a maintainer-script template, an
installer pane, the version derivation, or the release job's asset list.

## Packaging

<!-- agent-tripwire: The payload is rooted at `/`, not `/usr`; third-party `install()` rules are excluded -->

- **The package payload is rooted at `/`, not `/usr`.** `/etc` cannot sit under
  a `/usr` prefix, so `PACE_INSTALL_BINDIR`/`DOCDIR` spell their own
  `usr/` (and `opt/pace/` on macOS). A relative destination for the units
  would put them where systemd never looks — and on macOS an *absolute*
  `install(DESTINATION)` escapes CPack's staging tree and writes to the build
  host's real filesystem.
- **Neither a macOS `.pkg` nor an MSI has a conffile mechanism.** Both overwrite
  their payload on every install, so on both the live `pace-kv.yaml` is
  deliberately not payload: only a `.default` template ships, and it is copied to
  the real location exactly once, when nothing is there. macOS does this in the
  Runtime postinstall (`seed-config.sh.inc`), Windows in a custom action running
  the daemon's own `--seed-config` — which takes its destination from
  `SystemConfigPath`, so the seeded file and the startup lookup cannot disagree.
  Only the DEB conffile and the RPM `%config(noreplace)` can ship the live file
  directly. Uninstalling leaves the config behind on every platform.
- **An HTML installer pane must begin with its doctype.** Installer.app decides
  HTML from plain text by sniffing the first bytes of the resource, so the
  `<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier -->` header that opens every other file in the
  tree made the welcome and read-me panes render with every tag visible — the
  `.txt` license pane looking right is what disguised it. `mime-type="text/html"`
  on the Distribution XML element does *not* override the sniff (tried, and the
  panes stayed raw), so the doctype goes first and the licence comment after it.
  The same files need an explicit `<meta charset="utf-8">`: without it the em
  dashes arrive as mojibake, a defect the raw markup was hiding.
- **Third-party `install()` rules must be excluded.** A CPM-fetched zstd brings
  its own, and with the payload rooted at `/` they put `zstd.h` and `libzstd.a`
  into `/include` and `/lib` on the user's machine. Hence `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`.
- **macOS binaries must link nothing outside `/usr/lib`.** `CPM_USE_LOCAL_PACKAGES`
  defaults ON and makes CPM prefer Homebrew's shared yaml-cpp, so the package job
  passes `-DCPM_USE_LOCAL_PACKAGES=OFF -DOPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS=ON` and CI
  asserts the result with `otool -L`. `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` is pinned to
  13.3 (the floor at which the system libc++ has floating-point `std::to_chars`,
  which `std::format` needs) and must be set *before* `project()`.
- **A new installed binary is not one CMake row: the three packaging jobs name
  their build targets EXPLICITLY, and CPack installs every packaged component --
  on Windows one per application (the app table's COMPONENT column, each an MSI
  feature), elsewhere every app in the one Runtime component.** So a target carrying an
  `install()` rule that no packaging job builds fails at INSTALL time rather than
  at build time, on every platform at once:

  ```
  file INSTALL cannot find ".../target/pacectl": No such file or directory
  ```

  Measured (PR #1198): all three `Package (...)` jobs failed identically, and the
  two non-macOS ones had failed on the previous run too and were misread as
  cascades of an unrelated macOS build error -- which is what a shared cause looks
  like when one platform is red for a second reason. Add the target to all three
  `cmake --build ... --target ...` lines in `build.yml`, to the macOS *redistributable*
  loop -- a separate list, because that one asks which binaries are in the PAYLOAD
  while `PACE_MACOS_LINKED_TOOLS` asks which get a `/usr/local/bin` symlink,
  and the two coincide today without having to -- and to
  `PACE_MACOS_LINKED_TOOLS` itself.

  `macos-package-e2e.sh` used to keep two more copies of that symlink list, and
  the new binary reached the variable and neither copy: its symlink was asserted
  neither present after an install nor **removed** after an uninstall, the second
  being the direction nothing else in the tree reports. It derives them now
  (`linked_tools`, which REFUSES when it reads nothing, because an empty list makes
  both loops pass vacuously).

  **None of the `Package (...)` contexts is required**, so this does not block a
  merge -- `check-release-gate` stops a red packaging job shipping, which means the
  cost lands at release time on whoever is cutting it. A guard deriving each
  packaging job's target list from the installed set is
  [#1202](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1202); until it
  exists, the list above is the whole of it.
- **One install component per application on Windows, one payload everywhere else.** The app
  table in `src/apps/CMakeLists.txt` carries each app's COMPONENT; on Windows it is an MSI
  feature (`CM_C_<component>`, declared from `PACE_WINDOWS_FEATURES`), and the shared
  payload (docs, licence, VC++ runtime -- `PACE_SHARED_COMPONENT`) rides the REQUIRED Cli
  feature, as does `PATH`, which attached to a deselectable feature left every binary
  unreachable by name once it was deselected. Off Windows every app installs under Runtime, so
  the .deb, .rpm and .pkg payloads are meant to be unchanged; a listing diff of each package
  against the previous release's is what shows it. `cmake/Packaging.cmake` refuses a
  first-party component no generator packages -- blind, and failing OPEN, to an app whose table
  row carries `-` and later gains an `install()` rule. A silent first install names its
  features, and the documented ones and the `package-windows` steps list `CM_C_Cli` beside what
  they add.

## The version

<!-- agent-tripwire: The git tag is the only version source. `version.txt` must never come back -->

- **The git tag is the only version source, and `version.txt` must never come
  back.** There used to be a committed `version.txt`, and because
  `cmake/Version.cmake` read it *first* it was the real source of truth: a second
  version carrier that each release had to remember to bump in lock-step with the
  tag, and that pinned every build, every wire banner and every package to `0.0.1`
  for as long as it existed. `ctest -R repository-hygiene` now fails if it — or any
  other row in `scripts/check-repository-hygiene.cmake`'s table — is ever *tracked*
  again. The test asks the git **index**, not the filesystem, so it fails at
  `git add` time rather than after a commit, and an untracked local `version.txt`
  stays legitimate (it is in `.gitignore` and is read by nothing). A build that
  cannot reach a tag states its version with `-DPACE_VERSION=1.2.3`.
- **The resolved version triple must stay a bare numeric `X.Y.Z`, and the fallback
  with it.** `CMakeLists.txt` feeds it to `project(VERSION ...)`, which rejects
  anything else, and CPack carries it into the MSI `ProductVersion` (major/minor
  < 256, patch < 65536), the RPM `Version:` field (where `-` is illegal) and the
  Debian version (where `-` starts the package revision) — so `Version.cmake`
  validates the fields against a table and the *string*, never the triple, carries
  the `-12-gdeadbee`/`-dirty` suffixes. This is why the no-tag fallback is `0.0.0`
  and not `0.0.0-unknown`: the `docker` job takes that path on **every** ref
  regardless of clone depth, because `.dockerignore` excludes `.git/`, so a
  non-numeric fallback would turn every push red. It is also why the release
  trigger matches `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+` rather than `v*` — a `v0.1.0-rc1` tag
  cannot configure, and failing to *start* costs nothing where fifteen red jobs and
  a burnt notarization slot would.
## CI and the release job

<!-- agent-tripwire: Every `build.yml` checkout that could configure passes `fetch-depth: 0` -->

- **Every checkout in `build.yml` that could configure the project passes
  `fetch-depth: 0`, and the release job's asset list must stay the last key of its
  `with:` mapping.** The default depth-1
  checkout fetches no tags, so `git describe` finds nothing and the build silently
  falls back — which in a packaging job means artifacts named after a release
  nobody cut. Full history, not `fetch-tags: true`: fetching a tag into a depth-1
  clone leaves the tagged commit as an unrelated shallow root `describe` cannot
  reach. The two jobs that only *read* the workflow file — `check-release-gate`
  and `release` — are the stated exception and pass no `fetch-depth`, because
  history buys them nothing and a release must not be able to fail on a clone
  parameter that cannot affect it. Separately, `/publish-release` learns what a release should contain by
  parsing that literal asset list, and its extractor stops only at a line that does
  not look like a filename — `draft: true` looks exactly like one, so a key moved
  below the list is collected as a glob that can never match and publication blocks
  forever on a phantom asset. The same reason forbids writing `files:` followed by
  `|` anywhere else in that file, comments included. A step in the release job
  re-reads the list with that same extractor and fails on any entry containing
  whitespace or a colon, so the rule is enforced rather than merely documented.

## Releasing

<!-- agent-tripwire: Cutting a release is pushing a tag; CI runs the entire suite against the tagged tree -->

The version is the git tag, so cutting a release is pushing one:

```sh
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Pace 0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

That tag matches the trigger in `.github/workflows/build.yml`, which runs the
**entire** suite against the tagged tree — nothing about a release path is
exercised only at release time — and then the tag-gated `release` job collects the
three packaging jobs' artifacts, asserts that the set is complete and that every
filename carries the tag's version, and creates a **draft** GitHub release with
them attached. Nothing publishes automatically; a human does that with
`/publish-release` once the assets have been verified. `/draft-release` drives the
tagging half.

There is no changelog file: release notes are GitHub's generated commit summary
(`generate_release_notes: true`), so commit subjects are what a reader of the
release page sees.

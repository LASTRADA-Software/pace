# On-disk storage

Rules for `Cache/CowTreeStorage` and the CoW tree beneath it — specifically for
the part an operator cannot recover from by restarting: what is written to disk,
and what happens when a build meets a store it did not write.

Every rule here has already been a bug, and the expensive ones are silent. The
theme is that this layer holds the only copy of something: a cache is cheap to
lose but expensive to rebuild, and a store destroyed by the code meant to rescue
it is the worst outcome available.

## The format version

<!-- agent-tripwire: An old store is `UnsupportedFormatVersion`, never `Corrupt` -->

**A store's record layout is stamped, and a build reads exactly one version.**
`CowTreeStorage::CurrentFormatVersion` is what this build writes;
`FormatMarkerKey` is where it is recorded. Both live on the class rather than in
the `.cpp`, because they are the on-disk contract and anything that has to build
or inspect a store of a known vintage needs the same number rather than a second
copy of it.

**A store of another vintage is refused as `UnsupportedFormatVersion`, never as
`Corrupt`.** The two call for opposite responses — `Corrupt` means the bytes are
damaged and there is nothing to recover, this means a healthy store an operator
can still convert — and the *code* is what monitoring and every programmatic
caller sees, so the distinction cannot live only in the message text. It was
`Corrupt` once, and `Corrupt` is what tells somebody to `rm -rf` a cache that was
fine.

**`Corrupt` means the BYTES ARE DAMAGED, and nothing a client can send may reach
it** (#296). The rule above was written about a rare migration edge; the same code
was also reachable **on demand, by an unprivileged client**, which is strictly
worse. A set or a stream is an ordinary value blob distinguished only by its `flags`
word, and the memcached text verbs let a client choose that word -- so six planted
bytes read back with SMEMBERS reported disk corruption against a store whose every
record still verified.

- **A `bool` cannot carry an outcome with more than two meanings.** `SetCodec::Decode`
  and `StreamCodec::Decode` both returned one, and each of the four callers picked a
  code; three picked `Corrupt`. The codecs now return
  `std::expected<void, StorageError>` carrying `MalformedValue` and a reason, so the
  fifth caller has nothing left to pick. Fixed at the seam, never at the call site
  that noticed -- a per-caller correction leaves the next caller free to choose again.
- **`Corrupt` from a codec would be dishonest anyway.** Integrity is verified BELOW
  them -- `CowTreeStorage`'s CRC32C, and the compression codec -- both of which report
  `Corrupt` themselves before a byte reaches a value decoder. A failure there is
  always "these bytes are not a well-formed value of that type".
- **Taking the code away is half the fix; the other half is that something still
  counts.** `MalformedValue` is deliberately not a persistence failure, so it no
  longer moves `fastcached_write_errors_total` nor writes a `storage write failed`
  warning -- which on its own would trade a wrong signal for **no** signal.
  `CacheMalformedValues` is the row that keeps "clients are sending nonsense"
  visible and separate from "this disk is failing".
- **The regression test has two halves and the second is the one that gets
  forgotten.** A malformed client value must report `MalformedValue`, AND genuine
  damage must still report `Corrupt`. Widening the new code until real corruption
  stops being reported is worse than the original bug, so `CowTreeStorage_test`
  asserts the damaged-marker case is `Corrupt` *and not* `MalformedValue`.

**The refusal names the remedy.** An operator reading a refusal with no next step
reaches for deletion. The sentence says the store is intact and names the
conversion.

**A marker too short to hold its own `u32` really is damage**, and keeps
`Corrupt`. There is no version to report and nothing to convert.

## When the bytes really are damaged

<!-- agent-tripwire: `Corrupt` means the BYTES ARE DAMAGED, and nothing a client sends may reach it -->

Everything above is about keeping `Corrupt` narrow, so that it stays worth
believing. The other half is what an operator does when it fires, and a rule that
only prevents a wrong action is half a rule while the right one is unstated
(#484). The operator-facing answer is `docs/operations/corrupt-store.md`; what
belongs here is the part that constrains the code.

**One code, two events, and WHERE decides which.** `Open` is not a scan: it reads
the two meta slots, walks the free list and looks up two reserved keys — the
in-flight-conversion marker and the format marker — and `Replay()` is deliberately
a no-op. **The free-list walk is LIVE on every store, under every durability** (#1624; it was every
batched store until then), and this paragraph said the opposite until the file-growth fix:
`FilePageStore` writes the list with every meta and overrides the `freeRoot` that `CommitTxn` still pins to
`None`, so the walk reads real pages and its `Corrupt` refusals are reachable by damage.
A free-list LINK past the end of the file is one of them; an ENTRY past the end is NOT,
because the store now truncates its free tail after a durable flush and both surviving
metas may still name the cut ids. No list page a surviving meta names is ever cut, which
is what keeps the link check a damage check. So the reach that can refuse is the meta
slots, the free-list chain and the two reserved keys. Damage inside that reach refuses the process to start, and damage
anywhere else is found per key while the process serves. Both `fastcached` and
`fastcache-compile-node` treat a store that will not open as **fatal**, on purpose
— the operator named a path, and coming up without it delivers less than was
configured — which makes the first an outage and the second a degradation.
Anything that makes `Open` touch more of the store converts the second into the
first for the pages it newly reads, and that is a decision rather than an
optimisation.

**Nothing repairs a damaged store, and that is the answer rather than an
absence.** An operator who is told nothing goes looking for a tool, and the
nearest thing to hand is the conversion — which is not a repair, refuses damage,
and would waste the outage. Say "there is no salvage" out loud; do not let it be
inferred.

**Both halves are pinned, and the second is the one that gets forgotten.**
`CowTreeStorage_test` asserts that damage to both meta pages refuses at `Open`
with `Corrupt` — and, separately, that damage below them leaves the store **open**
with *some* keys still readable. A test that only counted corrupt keys would pass
against a store that had lost everything. That second assertion is what the whole
operator answer rests on: partial loss is the normal shape, so deleting the store
is both the correct procedure and the end of any chance of finding the cause, and
a page that says "copy it first" has to be describing something true.

**ONE damaged meta slot is a THIRD state, not a weaker version of the first**
(#632). `Corrupt` at open means both slots failed, so a fixture that only ever
damages both cannot tell *the alternation saved us* from *the damage happened to
land somewhere harmless*. It needs a real FILE, and that is not a preference:
`WriteMeta` encodes and CRCs whatever it is handed, so damaged meta bytes have no
API route at all, and an `InMemoryPageStore` `FaultPlan` reaches them only as a
torn write happening NOW rather than as the bytes an operator's file is already
sitting on when the process starts. Three separate things are pinned, each red
under a different break:

- The store **opens on the surviving slot's commit**, in BOTH directions. Damage
  only the live slot and a build that always took the older valid slot passes;
  damage only the stale one and a build that always took the newer passes. And
  what the live slot's loss costs is a **miss**, never `Corrupt` — the store is
  consistent, just with an earlier moment, and reporting damage for a key that
  was merely never committed in that view is the "delete a healthy cache"
  failure again.
- It says **nothing** while doing it. "Survived silently" is a claim about the
  log, and every assertion about the store itself holds under a build that
  opened and then complained. Nothing here takes an `ILogger` or a metrics sink,
  so a diagnostic would have to be a direct stream write and that is what the
  capture sees; it cannot see `fprintf`, which is stated rather than left to be
  assumed.
- The next commit lands in the **damaged** slot, under `Batched` AND `Fsync` --
  the reopen is a table row of both since #726, so the old `Batched`-only scope
  is gone. **What is asserted is the FIRST meta write after the degraded open**:
  since #1624 a clean close under `Fsync` writes a second one, the restate of the
  commit's own frees, and it alternates onto the survivor's slot. That is not a
  spend, because the commit is already fsynced in the damaged slot; the fixture
  states per row whether the close restates and asserts the survivor holds a
  restatement of the commit (one `txnId` later, the same root). Under `None`
  nothing of this is promised -- the commit was never synced, which is the
  power-loss decision under "Where a flush writes the free list" -- so no row
  claims it. A build that recovered correctly and then wrote
  over its one good slot passes everything above while leaving the store one
  torn write from unopenable, and that is the only state where getting the
  alternation wrong is unrecoverable rather than wasteful. **Which slot a commit
  takes is the page store's decision and no caller's**, on every durability:
  `WriteMeta` takes no slot argument, and both `FlushBatchLocked` and the strict
  path write `OtherSlot(_lastDurableSlot)`. That is not a tidiness point — see
  the entry below for the year this was two rules that disagreed.

  The fixtures still SEED with `Batched` and state it, and the reason is the
  store's SHAPE rather than the property. Measured, seeding two sessions of five
  `Set`s at each durability: `Batched` gives A at txn 11 and B at txn 6, one slot
  per generation; `Fsync` gives A at 10 and B at 11, **both inside generation
  2**, which collapses the "live commit against previous commit" the rows are
  written on. A fixture that inherited the default would go loudly **red**, not
  quietly green, but red for a store nobody meant to build. What it REOPENS with
  is a table row covering both, which is #726's regression test.

**An interface that asks a caller which meta slot to write is asking a question
only the store can answer** (#726, fixed). `IPageStore::WriteMeta` used to take
the slot, and its own contract was that a torn write "leaves the OTHER slot as
the live one on recovery" — which holds only if the slot written is the one NOT
holding the last durable meta, and which slot that is is state the caller does
not have. So the signature guaranteed a caller could get it wrong, and one did:
`CowTree::CommitTxn` derived `txnId mod 2`, `FilePageStore` honoured that
verbatim under `Fsync`/`None`, and `_lastDurableSlot` was neither read nor
updated on that path at all.

The parity agrees with the alternation only until something disturbs it, and **a
batched flush disturbs it as a matter of course** — it writes the LAST commit's
id into the alternating slot, so every store an ordinary daemon writes is
parity-broken (measured: txn 11 in A, txn 6 in B). Reopening such a store with
`Fsync` after one-slot damage therefore sent the first commit to the SURVIVING
slot: one valid meta page where `Batched` left two, at the one moment damage had
just been detected. `--storage-durability=fsync` is operator-selectable, so this
was reachable in production and not only in a fixture.

The fix removes the argument rather than correcting the caller, because a second
caller would face the same impossible choice. `InMemoryPageStore` gained the same
alternation in the same change, and that half matters more than it looks: the
crash-consistency suite runs against THAT store, so leaving it honouring a
caller-named slot would have left the model exhibiting the behaviour being
removed, with every case green. `LastDurableSlot()` is on the interface so a test
can assert the alternation instead of inferring it from page contents.

**`Meta`'s documented `txnId mod 2` parity is retired, and it was false long
before it was load-bearing.** Nothing maintained it; batching had been breaking it
for as long as batching existed. It was asserted in four places — `Meta.hpp`,
`PageId.hpp`, `README.md` and a fixture comment — and correcting one would have
left three. When a documented invariant turns out to be maintained by nothing, the
question is not only which code to change but **how many copies of the claim
exist**.

Both of this entry's own mistakes were **instrument** mistakes rather than wrong
answers, running in opposite directions, and the pair is on the record in
[`build-and-toolchain.md`](build-and-toolchain.md): a raw-`CowTree` seed keeps the
parity and does not reproduce the fault at all, so the first two probes came back
green and the finding read as false — it takes the `CowTreeStorage`-shaped seed,
where `Open` itself commits the format marker, to break parity. Then the probe
that did reproduce it committed ONCE, so "after" meant "after one commit" and a
snapshot was read as a steady state.

It is pinned twice, in two suites, and not by accident: `CowTreeStorage_test`
asks the operator's question — a daemon's store opens, serves, stays quiet, and
does not spend its surviving slot — and `FilePageStore_test` asks the library's,
which is the same three facts without Pace present. The surviving-slot
property is therefore pinned in **both**, for two different reasons rather than
by duplication: `_lastDurableSlot` is a `FilePageStore` member, so the library's
own guarantee has to be assertable from a suite that links only `CowTree`, while
the other suite asserts what the same behaviour costs an operator.
`src/CowTree/` is a standalone sibling that any project can pick up.

What cannot be shared is a TEST helper: `src/tests/` and `src/Pace/` are off
`CowTreeTests`' include path, which is the boundary that keeps the library
standalone. That is narrower than "nothing can be shared", and the wider claim was
in this file first — `src/CowTree/CowTree/` is on **both** suites' paths under the
same `<CowTree/...>` spelling, which is how `CowTreeStorage_test` reaches
`Meta.hpp`. A boundary stated too widely is what licenses the next copy.

And the duplication is wider than file I/O, which this entry claimed until it was
counted: `MetaDamageOffset`, `SlotBytes`, `DecodeSlot` and `DamageMetaSlot` all
exist in both fixtures, and three of those encode the on-disk LAYOUT — the slot
offset, and where the CRC'd payload ends — rather than test plumbing. By the
sentence above they would belong in `src/CowTree/CowTree/` if they earned a public
helper, and they have not: two call sites in two test binaries is not a public
contract, and shipping a damage helper in the library to serve them would be worse
than the copy. That is a decision, and it is recorded here so the third copy has
to argue with it.

**`OtherSlot` was on that list and came off it, which is the test of when one of
these earns promotion.** #726 needed "the slot we did not last make durable" in
two PRODUCTION paths, so it moved to `PageId.hpp` and both test copies were
deleted — and a line in this file recording that it "exists in no production file"
went with them. What promotes a test helper is a production caller, never a second
test wanting it; and a rulebook sentence that describes where code currently lives
is a fact with an expiry date, so it has to be searched for when the code moves.

**The signals are not the same on both binaries.** `WriteErrorReportingStorage` is
constructed only by `fastcached`, so `fastcached_write_errors_total` and the
`storage write failed` warning cannot move on a compile node — its tier is wrapped
in `ShardedStorage` and nothing else. A counter that is exported and can never rise
is the shape the metrics rules already name, so anything written about reacting to
damage says which binary it is about.

## What a tier's byte figures are denominated in

<!-- agent-tripwire: Both tiers' `bytesUsed` count STORED bytes -->

**Both tiers count STORED bytes; the disk tier counts its page footprint.** It was
otherwise until the file-growth fix (owner decision, 2026-10-03): `CowTreeStorage`
charged `originalLen`, the size before the codec ran, so a 64 GiB disk budget held
68.7 GB of logical values in about 11 GB of pages and compression bought the budget
nothing. Now `InMemoryLruStorage` charges the stored size it always did
(`_bytesUsed += storedSize` in `InsertNew`), and `CowTreeStorage::FootprintBytes` is
`IPageStore::PagesInUse()` times the page size -- tree pages, out-of-line value pages,
the free list's own pages and the two meta slots, compressed values at their compressed
size. Cited by SYMBOL rather than by offset on purpose: a line number in a file still
being edited goes stale silently.

**The budget is the FOOTPRINT, never the file's length.** A free page in the middle of
the file cannot be cut, so a bound on the length would evict entries without shrinking
anything and could empty the cache. What holds the length to the footprint is the page
store: the free list is written into free pages, `Allocate` takes the lowest free id,
and each durable flush cuts the free tail (`FilePageStore::PagesInUse` states the
relation). **Both directions:** the file is never shorter than the footprint, and longer
by the free pages until a flush or later churn removes them --
`fastcached_tier_file_bytes` reports the length beside `bytesUsed` so the gap is visible.

**An entry's cost is the pages its eviction frees, which for an inline value is nothing
until its leaf empties.** The tree frees an empty leaf and never merges underfull ones,
so a store of small inline values may evict several entries to free one page; values
large enough to spill to an overflow chain free their pages one eviction at a time.
`_storeBytes` still totals `originalLen` because the meta records it, and decides
nothing.

**A test of compression through the disk tier asserts ENTRIES, not bytes.** At one
budget the codec on must hold strictly more entries than the codec off, with the
footprint at or under the limit -- "A compressed disk tier holds more under the same
budget" in `CowTreeStorage_test`. The old trap ran the other way: the case compared
65536 with 65536 and read as *the codec did nothing* while the tier compressed
correctly the whole time, because the figure it read did not see the codec.

Neither figure is the RAM a tier costs. `indexBytes` is the key index and is resident
for both halves, which is why it is reported separately and must not be added to
either (#175).

## Converting a store

<!-- agent-tripwire: A format is convertible exactly as long as its reader is in `RecordFormats()` -->

**A format is convertible exactly as long as its reader is in
`RecordFormats()`.** That table *is* the migration policy stated as data: bumping
`CurrentFormatVersion` without adding a row is the decision to discard every
existing store, and a decision made by deleting a line is one somebody makes on
purpose. Two `static_assert`s hold the table to the version — it ends at
`CurrentFormatVersion`, and every row sits at its own index from the first,
checked row by row. Arithmetic on the ends is not enough: `{3, 5, 5}` has the
right first version, last version and length, and silently cannot read v4.

**Every reader returns the same `ParsedRecord` the current encoders consume.** A
reader for an older layout fills in what that layout *meant* — v3 never
compressed, so `Identity` and `original == stored` are facts, not defaults. That
is what keeps `Migrate` from ever learning which version it is converting from,
and what makes the next format a new parser plus a row rather than new code in
the conversion.

**Which reader to use is an INFERENCE, so validate before writing anything.** A
store with no marker at all is *assumed* to be the last version that did not
stamp one. The layout before that had no kind byte, so its first byte is a flags
byte that reads as an inline-record tag whenever flags are zero — and its value
bytes then land where the length field is read from. A reader that only asks "are
there at least that many bytes left" accepts it and returns an empty value, which
an in-place conversion then writes over the real one. Two guards, both
load-bearing: an old reader requires a record to end **exactly** where its value
does, and nothing is written until a read-only pass has parsed every record.
A store this build cannot read must come back **unmodified**.

**The conversion commits in slices, and that is the design.** One transaction
would be atomic and would also inflate the store permanently: a CoW commit frees
replaced pages only *at* the commit, so a single transaction allocates a page per
record per tree level and reuses none of them — measured at 3 pages per record, a
20× file inflation — and `CommitTxn` writes `freeRoot = PageId::None()`, so the
next process cannot reclaim any of it either.

**Committing is not enough to get those pages back.** A batching page store holds
a freed page until the commit that freed it is durable, which it defers to a
fixed commit interval. Without an explicit `IPageStore::Flush()` per slice the
growth stays per-record and the slicing buys nothing — 4× the records cost 5.3×
the growth, measured.

**What slicing costs is atomicity, and the progress marker pays for it.** Each
slice records the source version and its last converted key in the *same*
transaction as the records it converted, so an interrupted run leaves a store
that says what it is: `Open` refuses it by name, and running the conversion again
resumes from the last committed slice. Nothing is converted twice — which matters
because a current-format record fed to an older reader parses, and silently
yields wrong flags and a wrong length.

**An overflow record keeps its chain.** Only the leaf descriptor is rewritten, so
converting a 50 GB cache does not need 100 GB to do it.

**Conversion is offline, and is not something `Open` does for itself.** It
rewrites every leaf record, which on a cache worth migrating is long enough that
a supervisor would time out the start it was hiding inside.

**It refuses a path that names no store**, rather than creating one and reporting
"nothing to convert" over it — which would turn a typo into a stray file while
the real store stayed refused at every start.

## The tree beneath it

<!-- agent-tripwire: A tree walk is bounded by `PageCount()`, and must not overlap a commit -->

**`ReadTxn::ForEach` is an administrative scan, not a lookup path.** It reads
every page, so it costs the size of the store rather than its depth. `Get` is
what a lookup uses.

**A walk is bounded by `IPageStore::PageCount()`.** A tree reaches each of its
pages once, so a walk that has read more is following a cycle — and a cycle is
precisely what a per-page CRC cannot catch, since every page around the loop is
individually valid. Without the budget it is not a wrong answer but an unbounded
one.

**A walk must not overlap a commit.** A commit frees the pages it replaced and
`Allocate` recycles them, so a scan pinned across one either fails with
`OutOfRange` or — once an index has been handed out again — reads a page that now
belongs somewhere else and reports keys that are wrong rather than merely stale.
This is a property of the page stores, not of the walk: `Get` on a snapshot
pinned across a commit fails identically. The isolation `ReadTxn`'s class comment
describes stops at the first commit that reclaims a page.

Staging into an *uncommitted* write transaction from inside a walk is fine, and
is what the conversion does.

## Where a flush writes the free list

<!-- agent-tripwire: A flush never extends a file whose free list can hold its own list -->

**A flush never extends a file whose free list can hold its own list, never writes the list
into a pending free or the previous list's pages, and truncates only `_freeList` ids, before
the pending frees graduate.** `FilePageStore::WriteFreeListLocked` and
`TruncateFreeTailLocked`; every clause has already been a bug or is the whole argument for
why the next one is not.

- **Extending for the list's pages is how a 64 GiB disk tier became a 103 GB file, 89 % free
  pages.** Each flush grew the file by `ceil(F / idsPerPage)` pages and handed the previous
  list's pages back to `F`, so a store at its bound grew geometrically. The list's pages come
  out of `_freeList`; the file is extended only for the shortfall when `_freeList` cannot
  hold its own list.
- **The superseded meta is the one a crash or a damaged slot falls back to**, and it still
  needs two kinds of page that are not in `_freeList`: a PENDING free is in its tree, and the
  previous list's pages are its `freeRoot`. Writing the list into either damages exactly the
  fallback -- and a clean reopen never reads the fallback, so no ordinary case can see it.
  "A flush writes its free list into no page the meta it supersedes still needs"
  (`FilePageStore_test`) reopens on the superseded meta, and goes red under either theft.
- **The list NAMES everything free in the new meta's world**, pending frees and the previous
  list's pages included. Naming is not taking; leaving them out marked them live after every
  restart.
- **A truncation cuts only pages free in BOTH surviving metas**, which is why it runs before
  the pending frees graduate. Both metas may still name a cut id as an ENTRY, so recovery
  skips an entry past the end of the file; a LINK past the end stays `Corrupt`, because no
  list page a surviving meta names is ever cut.

**Since the disk budget became the page footprint, a leaked page is lost CAPACITY, not only
file length** -- it counts against the budget and evicts a live entry, for good. So no page may
leak, and a disk budget starts under any durability (#1624):

- **Every meta write carries a list.** `CommitMetaLocked` writes the list, then the meta, then
  graduates the pending frees, for Fsync, None and every batched flush alike.
- **A commit's list describes what the commits BEFORE it freed**, because a transaction's pages
  are freed after its meta is written; the last commit's own frees reach a list only through a
  later write. A clean close therefore restates the last durable meta under the next `txnId`
  when a free is pending (`~FilePageStore`). **Only the destructor may**: while a tree still
  runs, its next commit would take the same `txnId`, recovery breaks a tie towards slot A, and
  that could revive the older root after its pages were reused. No commit follows a destructor.
- **Recovery frees what a crash extended.** The meta records `dataPages`, and recovery frees
  every page past it that the file holds, so a crash between a growth and its commit leaks nothing.
- **The per-commit cost** is `ceil(F / 510)` list pages at 4 KiB, where F counts every entry the
  list names, pending frees and the previous list's pages included. Fsync pays one extra fsync, and
  only when a list page was written; None syncs nothing.
- **The decision this took: `Open` walks free-list pages on a None store too.** None never syncs
  them, so after a POWER LOSS (not a process crash) a None store can be refused `Corrupt` where it
  used to open. That is consistent with None promising no crash consistency, and it is a decision
  rather than an optimisation because making `Open` touch more of the store is one.
- **The one residual**: a store written by ANY build before #1624 keeps the pages it already
  lost -- not only one predating the file-growth fix, since every build before #1624 leaked
  through all three routes above (a clean close after an interval flush, every Fsync or None
  restart, every crash). Those pages are marked live, no list names them, and a layout-1 meta
  records no `dataPages`, so nothing in this build can reclaim them either. Do not describe the
  footprint as exact on a store with that history.

## What a refused `Open` can say

<!-- agent-tripwire: A refused `Open` carries the **errno it classified** -->

**A lock refusal carries the errno it was classified from.** `FilePageStore::Open` classified a
system error and then discarded it, so the refusal reached a log as
`code=14 errno=0 ctx=FilePageStore::Open` — `InUse`, and nothing about which errno decided it.

That one missing integer is the whole cost of
[#1507](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1507). `InUse` asserts *somebody
holds this file*, and on the failure that opened the ticket **that claim was false**: 31 of 32
test processes had drawn the same filename, because `std::random_device` answers zero for 57% of
draws on that host, so `flock` was refusing exactly as designed. Diagnosing it meant patching
the test to print the errno and rebuilding, because nothing on the way out of `Open` carried it.
The refusal was right and unfalsifiable at the same time, which is the worst combination a
diagnostic can have: it names a cause, the cause is wrong, and the only way to find out is to
stop trusting the instrument and rebuild it.

**Absent is a disengaged `std::optional<int>`, never `0`.** `InvalidArg` is decided from the
arguments and a damaged meta page from bytes already read, so neither has a system error to
report — and *there was no system call* is a different fact from *the call returned 0*, which is
`errno`'s own value for success. Collapsing those two is the defect the type exists to remove,
so it cannot be spelled with a sentinel. The projection onto `StorageError::systemCode`, an
`int` whose `0` has meant *none* across this tree since long before, happens at
`CowTreeStorage`'s `TranslateError` and is the boundary's existing convention rather than a loss
this rule permits.

**Two things the refusal type deliberately does not have**, and both are the same mistake from
opposite sides:

- **No implicit conversion from `CowTreeError`.** It would let all seven existing
  `return std::unexpected(CowTreeError::X)` sites inside `Open` compile untouched — including
  the three that DO hold an errno. Convenience that silently produces the no-code refusal at
  exactly the sites the change exists for is the defect wearing a shortcut's clothes.
- **No `operator==(CowTreeError)`.** Producing a refusal from a bare cause loses nothing;
  COMPARING one to a bare cause lets every consumer read the enumerator and drop the code, which
  is the shape that was filed. A caller that wants the cause spells `.cause`.

**The control is the load-bearing half of the test.** Asserting that a contended refusal carries
a code passes just as well on a build that stamps whatever errno it last saw onto *every*
refusal — so the `CorruptMetas` case asserts it carries NONE. Measured by neutering: reporting no
code reddens the contended case alone, stamping a code on every refusal reddens the control
alone, and reporting `ENOLCK` in place of the real errno reddens the contended case again through
a **round trip** — the code is fed back through `ClassifyLockFailure` and must arrive at
`Contended`, rather than being compared to a named errno, because the two platforms spell this
condition `EWOULDBLOCK`/`EAGAIN` and `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` and a named one would make the
case a statement about the host it was written on.

## What a reopened store can name

<!-- agent-tripwire: The LRU mirror holds what this SESSION touched -->

**The LRU mirror holds what this SESSION touched, never what is on disk.** `_lru` and
`_index` are populated by `TouchOrInsert` alone, which every read and write verb calls
and no `Open` path does. So a reopened store's mirror starts empty and fills only with
traffic, while the tree holds everything.

That is the fourth instance of one family, and the first three are closed: state that
should describe the STORE was populated only by touch — the index cost capacity reserves
(#175), the free list (#990), the byte total (#1006). Each of those was fixed by finding
a durable SOURCE for a number. **The EVICTION half of this one could not be: eviction
needs a VICTIM to name, not a figure.**

**And that sentence used to stand alone, which is how the fifth instance survived for
months underneath it.** *Eviction* cannot use a durable source; the FIGURES sitting beside
it in the same snapshot can, and `itemCount` was still `_index.size()` — so a node
restarted onto a full cache reported zero items next to a `bytesUsed` describing the whole
store (#1483). Two figures in one row, denominated over different populations, and an
operator correctly reads `items 0` as an empty cache.

Three things make it worth this much space:

- **The durable source was already being called fourteen lines further down the same
  function**, for `indexBytesAtCapacity`. Nothing was missing; the line simply had not
  been revisited when #1006 fixed its neighbour — and #1006's fix comment sits three lines
  below the defect, describing the same failure for the other field. *A fix that names its
  own defect does not generalise itself to the field next to it.*
- **The obvious repair over-counts.** `CowTree::ItemCount()` is documented *approximate*
  and counts the store's own sentinel records, which is right for an upper bound a
  reservation wants and wrong for a figure compared against `--cache-disk`. So the rule is
  not *use the tree's count*: it is **a figure describing the store reads the store, at the
  store's own denomination.** `build-and-toolchain.md` rates an over-report as the same
  defect in the louder direction.
- **A bare `- 1` would be right for a reason living in another function.** A store with a
  conversion marker is REFUSED at `Open`, so a serving store carries exactly the format
  marker — a fact `EnsureFormatVersion` owns and `Snapshot` would silently depend on. It
  comes off a `ReservedKeys()` table with a column stating that dependency, and
  `IsReservedKey` walks the same table, so a third sentinel is one edit rather than two
  that can disagree.

**What must not be "fixed" alongside it:** `indexBytes` still reports the PRESENT. That is
#175's whole argument — a reservation may not be taken from a startup reading — so a change
making every figure durable destroys the distinction rather than completing it. The pinning
case now asserts the CONTRAST: a cold index beside a warm item count, and one read moving
the index while the count does not.

**So eviction reaches the cold set first, and that is LRU rather than a workaround.** An
entry the mirror does not hold has not been read or written since startup, so it is
strictly less recently used than anything in `_lru`. Taking it first is what the policy
means here.

Getting this wrong is not a missing optimisation, and the measurement is the reason to
believe it (#1012, `ctest -R cowstorage`, the neutered-fix run): a store reopened over
its bound, with ONE key read back, evicted **that key** — the mirror's only member, and
the warmest thing in the store — and then stopped, the mirror being empty again. The
bound stayed violated at 7000 against 3000. One cause, two failures, and the second is
invisible to any test that only asserts the total.

The walk that finds cold entries is bounded per call, resumes from a cursor, and gathers
keys before erasing any of them, because **a walk must not overlap a commit** (above).
It never restarts: a cold entry cannot be created — anything written after startup goes
through `TouchOrInsert` and is mirrored by construction — so the cold set only shrinks
and one forward pass is complete. A failed walk is not an exhausted one.

`evictedUnfetched` is deliberately NOT incremented for a cold victim. That bit lives on
the mirror node, which a cold entry has none of, so whether it was ever read is not
something the process knows — and an unknown recorded as a "no" is a claim the data does
not support. It undercounts, which is the honest direction.

- **[#1633](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1633)** — under Fsync, a
  meta that `CommitMetaLocked` has written whose fsync then FAILS leaves `_lastDurableSlot`
  where it was, and `CowTree::AbortTxn` returns that transaction's pages to `_freeList`. The
  next commit's list pages and data pages may then be written into pages that the possibly
  persisted, higher-`txnId` meta references, so an I/O error followed by a crash can revive a
  root over clobbered pages. The window predates #1624 for data pages; #1624 adds list pages to
  it. Filed rather than fixed in that change because the likely remedy -- poisoning the store
  after any fsync failure that follows a slot write -- changes the store's failure semantics.

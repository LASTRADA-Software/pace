# The compile cache key

Rules for `src/apps/pace-cc/` and `src/Pace/CompileCache/`: what goes
into a cache key, how paths are canonicalized so two machines derive the same one,
what a direct-mode manifest may record, and what a hit is allowed to replay.

Read this before touching `CacheKey.cpp`, `DirectManifest.cpp`, `PathCanon`,
`RootReconciler.cpp`, `CompileValue`, `CmdLine`, or anything that decides whether
a compile is cacheable.

Two failure shapes recur here and are worth holding in mind while reading: a rule
broken one way collapses the hit rate silently (every unit test still passes), and
broken the other way serves an unrelated object under a **zero exit code**. Every
rule below has already been at least one of the two.

## The five rules the end-to-end tests assert

<!-- agent-tripwire: Preprocess with line markers suppressed -->

`pace-kv` and `pace-cc` are both installed. Three things the launcher's
cache key depends on, each of which has already caused a silent hit-rate
collapse or a mis-serve and is now covered by regression tests:

- **Preprocessing must suppress line markers** (`/EP` on MSVC, `-E -P` on GNU).
  A `# 1 "/abs/path.cpp"` marker embeds the checkout path in the hashed text.
  On MSVC that is `/EP` **alone**: `/EP` and `/P` are alternatives, not modifiers
  — `/EP` preprocesses to stdout, `/P` to a `<base>.i` file, and MSVC documents
  the pair as "to the file, without `#line`". Passing both left the launcher
  hashing an empty stdout, so a Windows key carried nothing from the source and
  an edited file was answered with the object built from the previous revision.
  That is a wrong build rather than a cold cache, and direct mode hid it, since
  its manifest hashes the source's own bytes — hence the e2e case that edits a
  source with `PACE_NO_DIRECT=1` and requires a MISS.
- **`/` introduces an option only on Windows.** On POSIX it starts an absolute
  path, and treating it as an option leaves absolute paths unrelativized.
- **Only machine-independent dependency paths may be hashed.** The dependency set
  is part of the key so a moved header re-keys; hashing a toolchain path along
  with it would re-key on the *machine* instead, and two boxes with the same
  compiler at different prefixes would stop sharing every entry they have.
- **A root and the paths a driver emits must be reconciled on both sides or
  neither.** Every root test is a string prefix comparison, so a root spelled
  differently from what the compiler echoes back matches nothing it emits — and
  that empties the keyed dependency set, silences the replay guard, and leaves the
  producing machine's paths in the stored value, all at once and all silently.
  `Cc::IPathResolver` resolves the roots and every emitted path through the same
  function; resolving only one side breaks the driver that previously worked.
  - **The root scan is a side too.** An object bound to its checkout is judged by
    whether it names a root, and the key accepts any spelling the filesystem
    resolves onto one. The two drifted apart: an `-I` spelled wholly in 8.3 short
    names was tokenized as `<BUILDTREE>` by the key and matched no needle of the
    scan, so a second build directory was served the first one's
    `__builtin_FILE()` — a WRONG HIT, measured on `cl` and clang-cl. So the
    spellings are ONE list, `Cc::RootAliasList`: `RootReconciler` maps a path onto
    a root ONLY after recording the ancestors of its spelling that resolve to a
    root -- walked up the WHOLE spelling, because a count of components missed an
    alias whose tail crossed a second junction and the key mapped it anyway (a
    second wrong hit), and stopping at the first root bound an alias that runs
    through the build tree into the source root to the source root alone (a
    third, and through a SUBDIRECTORY of it a fourth). So the rule is the CLASS:
    for every root ANY ancestor resolves into, an ancestor is recorded for it --
    the lowest resolving TO it, else the highest resolving INTO it -- checked
    GENERATIVELY over enumerated link compositions, never shape by shape. A path
    no ancestor of which resolves into a root is left unmapped.
  - **And an ancestor is recorded as SPELLED, not only as the walk asked about it.**
    The walk asks about the lexical normal form, and which spelling a compiler
    writes depends on its FLAGS (measured): `cl` writes the `-I` spelling
    verbatim, `.` and `..` kept, with no debug flag, collapses it under `/Z7`,
    `/Zi` or `/ZI` (object and `/showIncludes`) and under `/FC` (the object only);
    clang-cl writes it verbatim, and under `-Z7` both. So `jx\zz\..\L1` recorded
    only as `jx\L1` was a needle a verbatim object never contained -- a fifth
    wrong hit, measured on clang-cl -- and recorded only as spelled it is one a
    collapsed object never contains (measured, `cl /FC`). BOTH halves are
    load-bearing: each walked ancestor's spelled prefix is DERIVED (the longest
    prefix whose normal form it is) and recorded beside the normal form, and an
    e2e leg covers each writer. Where none can be derived, or the two lead to different
    places (a `..` after a link, read physically on POSIX, ascends from the
    TARGET), the mapping is refused. The generative check shared the normal-form
    premise and could not see this, so it now asks dotted spellings too, under
    BOTH readings of `..`, and asserts coverage against the spelling AS WRITTEN;
    its figures are pinned exactly, never as floors.
    `BindCheckout` seeds each part's 8.3 short form through
    `IPathResolver::ShortForm`, and the scan reads that list at STORE time. A
    second derivation of "which spellings are this root", or a mapping that can
    happen without the recording, is the defect.

- **A compile that writes a second artefact is not cached at all.** What a hit
  reproduces is the object and the dependency record; a **C++ module interface
  unit** also writes a BMI (`.ifc`, `.pcm`), and `/Yc` a precompiled header.
  `cl /Zi` and `/ZI` write the translation unit's types into a PDB shared across the
  target and leave only a reference in the object, so they are refused for
  `Flavor::Cl` alone: clang-cl reads both spellings as `/Z7`, which a row's
  `onlyFlavor` column says. Replay one and the second artefact is either missing
  afterwards — which fails loudly — or left over from a previous build, which does
  not. The module rule has two halves, and neither may be dropped: the module
  **extensions** (`.ixx`, `.cppm`, `.ccm`, `.cxxm`, `.c++m`, `.mxx`) are classified
  as their own language and refused by name, and an ordinary source **promoted by
  a flag** (`cl /interface`, `-fmodule-output`, `--precompile`) is refused off a
  table. Until this was written down the first half held by accident — those
  extensions simply were not in `IsSourceSuffix`, so such a line fell through as
  "no source file found" and was passed through *in silence*, which reads exactly
  like a broken cache; and the obvious "add .ixx so modules are supported" change
  would have turned that accident into a silent wrong build. The refusal now says
  so under `PACE_VERBOSE`. **The flag half holds through clang-cl's pass-through
  too** (`/clang:-fmodule-output=x.pcm`, #1680): `ProducesSideArtefact` judges the
  argument a pass-through carries, by the driver it is handed to, where it used to read
  the whole spelling, match no row, and cache a compile whose hit came back without its BMI.

  **`cl /Yu` is refused as well although it writes nothing**: its object is
  tied to the one `pch.obj` it was compiled against, and the key sees neither tie.
  *Measured* with `cl` 19.51.36252 and `link` 14.51.36252 over a two-build `/Yc` +
  `/Yu` reproduction, where two checkouts produced the SAME key: the object carries
  `-INCLUDE:__@@_PchSym_…`, a symbol whose name differs between the two checkouts'
  `pch.obj`, and its types open with an `LF_PRECOMP` record naming that `pch.obj` by
  absolute path. A hit replayed into the other checkout still forced the first
  one's symbol and failed to link (`LNK2011`, then `LNK1120`), and one replayed
  after the same checkout's PCH was rebuilt linked with exit 0 and `LNK4206` —
  *linking object as if no debug info* — which is a wrong artefact that looks right.
  clang-cl 22.1.3's `/Yu` object has neither record and every replay linked and ran,
  so the rows are `onlyFlavor = Cl` and a test pins clang-cl's `/Yu` cacheable.
  *Inferred, not measured*: that the symbol's name is that absolute path under a
  letter substitution (it decodes to one), that `LF_PRECOMP`'s signature changes on
  every `/Yc` build, and that CMake's `cmake_pch.hxx` + `/FI` shape behaves the
  same.

The first two break cross-checkout sharing while every unit test still passes,
the third breaks it the moment two machines differ, the fourth breaks it the
moment a root is spelled unusually, and the fifth is a wrong *build* rather than a
cold cache, so `scripts/compile-cache-e2e.sh` (POSIX) and
`run-launcher-e2e.ps1` (Windows) assert them end-to-end in CI on both
platforms.

## The compiler identity is the driver AND the target it generates for

<!-- agent-tripwire: The compiler identity is the driver AND the target it generates for. The **key** folds the target, the **fingerprint** must not -->

A banner identifies the **driver**. A driver's code generation is not a function of
the driver alone, and for `clang-cl` it is not even close: clang detects the MSVC
installation it will be compatible with and sets `-fms-compatibility-version` from
it, and clang's Microsoft C++ ABI gates version-specific code generation on that
value. Same `clang-cl.exe`, different MSVC beside it, different object.

Measured on clang-cl 22.1.3, one binary:

<!-- table-total: none -->
| where it runs | effective `-fms-compatibility-version` |
| --- | --- |
| a developer command prompt | `19.51.36252`, from the MSVC install |
| a Windows **service** (no `INCLUDE`, no prompt) | `19.33`, clang's built-in default |

A `noexcept` function type mangles `P6AXXZ` below 19.12 and `P6AXX_E` from 19.12 on,
so this reaches defined **and** undefined symbols.

It is not an MSVC-only shape. Stock `g++` on Ubuntu x86_64 and aarch64 prints one
`--version` first line, so an architecture-independent translation unit keyed the
same on both — the same defect with no MSVC anywhere near it.

- **The key folds the target; the fingerprint does not.** They answer different
  questions and one string cannot serve both. A fingerprint decides which **worker**
  may serve a client, so folding the target in would split a developer-prompt
  launcher from a service-run worker — the mismatch #145 removed, reintroduced for a
  fact the dispatch line now states outright. A key decides which **object** may be
  served, and there the target is load-bearing. `CacheCompilerId` builds the first;
  `CompilerBanner` alone still feeds `CachedToolchainFingerprint`, and the compile
  node must keep computing it the same way or the two ends stop matching in silence.
  - **It DOES fold the driver's argument GRAMMAR, and that is a third question**
    ([#226](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/226)). The target is
    code generation; the grammar is which spellings the driver can READ, and it decides
    whether a dispatched compile runs at all. `clang-cl`, `clang++` and `clang` from one
    LLVM install print the same banner — clang's does not name its own `argv[0]` the way
    a GNU driver's does — and own one include tree, so both of the fingerprint's other
    inputs are identical between them BY CONSTRUCTION and it collapsed all three onto one
    value. A worker looks a toolchain up by fingerprint, runs its OWN driver, and appends
    the client's `args` verbatim, which `RemoteCompileArgs` built in the CLIENT's grammar
    — so on a machine with both, one family was always routed to a driver that could not
    read its arguments: a GNU driver reads `/std:c++20` as a filename, the job fails, and
    the client falls back to a local compile. Wasted remote work rather than a wrong
    object, but distribution was silently off for that family with every counter reading
    zero, which is the failure shape this subsystem exists to avoid. #224 only moved which
    family it happened to.
    - A **NAME**, `DriverGrammarName`, never the enumerator's value: a fingerprint is
      compared between machines and across builds, so folding an integer makes reordering
      the enum a silent fleet-wide split, where folding the name makes it a rename nobody
      performs by accident. `DriverFamily::None` is EMPTY — an unrecognised driver's
      fingerprint is then exactly what it was, which is the conservative direction, since
      it cannot silently join either family's fleet.
    - Folded as its own length-prefixed field and never appended to the banner. Two pieces
      concatenated are not a framing, and one banner naming three drivers is the whole
      reason the value exists.
    - **And it is in the cache file NAME as well as the digest.** On a POSIX install
      `clang++` and `clang-cl` are both symlinks to `clang`, so a resolution that
      canonicalizes hands them one path: with the grammar in the digest alone the second
      driver reads the first's entry, finds a stamp that validates — the stamp covers the
      binary and the roots, which are identical — and returns a fingerprint computed for
      the other grammar. A false MATCH, which is the one error direction this mechanism
      exists to prevent, so it is closed regardless of what `ResolveCompiler` does on any
      platform. `toolchain-v2` and `toolchain-cache-name-v2` moved together. `toolchain-v3`
      (#1656, which trees are folded) moved alone, because the stamp folds the schema
      since then, so a bump misses every older cache entry without renaming the file.
    - A test staging two different include trees would pass under the bug. The banner and
      the file list are held EQUAL and the grammar is the only difference, with the
      same-grammar case asserted beside it — a digest that separated everything would pass
      the first check while splitting one toolchain across two machines.
- **A dispatched compile states the target on the line, first.** A worker otherwise
  re-derives it from its own machine. `--target=<triple>` goes **ahead** of the
  build's own arguments, so a `--target=` or `-m32` the build states still wins, as
  it does locally — which is also why probing the ambient default is sufficient and
  the compile's own command line is not needed. Appending it would override the
  build, and compiling for a target the build did not ask for is a wrong object
  rather than a failed one.
- **`cl` has no target to ask for, so its BANNER has to carry one — which is why it
  must be a real banner**
  ([#195](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/195)).
  `TargetDiscovery::None` is right about MSVC: which code generator runs is decided
  by which `cl.exe` is invoked, and no command line restates it. So the whole of an
  MSVC identity is the banner — in `CacheCompilerId` *and* in
  `CachedToolchainFingerprint`, the one compiler where the two still say the same
  thing. It was the constant `cl` on every MSVC ever installed, because `cl` answers
  `--version` by printing its banner and *then* exiting 2, and the banner requires a
  zero exit. Bare `cl` prints the same line and exits 0, so asking it that way
  (`DriverSpec::versionFlags`, MSVC's row **empty**) is what makes
  `Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.51.36252 for x64` the identity
  — version *and* target, out of a driver that can be asked for neither. The x86 and
  x64 `cl.exe` of one toolset share an include tree exactly, so until then they were
  one toolchain to the key, to the fingerprint, and to the scheduler alike.
- **One flag closes both halves.** The cc1 triple EMBEDS the compatibility version:
  `--target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc19.11.0` produces an object byte-identical to
  `-fms-compatibility-version=19.11`. It therefore also closes the case where a
  `clang-cl` on a POSIX worker — which after #145 had nothing Windows-specific left
  in its digest — could return an ELF object to a client expecting COFF.
- **Read the `-cc1` line's `-triple`, never the `Target:` header.** Both name a
  triple and the header comes first, but the header is UNVERSIONED
  (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`). A parser that took whichever it found first would pin
  the architecture, drop the code-generation contract, and look entirely correct
  doing it.
- **Validate what comes back, and reject a leading dash.** The value is read
  positionally — the argument after `-triple` — so an option carrying none leaves
  the next FLAG in its place, and `-emit-obj` satisfies every other test for a
  triple. It would reach both a cache key and a `--target=` argument.
- **Discovering a target and stating one are different questions.** `gcc` can be
  asked and cannot be told: it is a fixed-target driver with no `--target=`, so its
  target belongs in the **key**, which decides which object may be served, and must
  never reach a **dispatched line**, where the driver would reject the flag and fail
  the compile. `TargetPinPrefixFor` is the seam, and an empty prefix means exactly
  that — identified, not pinned. Only `cl` is neither: which code generator runs is
  decided by *which* `cl.exe` is invoked, and no command line can restate that.
- **Which line is authoritative is the driver's property, not the parser's.** `gcc`
  prints no `-cc1` invocation — its frontend is `cc1plus` and takes no `-triple` —
  so its `Target:` header is the whole answer. On a clang driver that same header is
  the unversioned half-answer. Two mechanisms, chosen by the table; one reader
  trying both lines would silently downgrade every clang driver whose frontend line
  it happened to miss.
- **An empty triple means UNCHANGED, not an empty field.** `CacheCompilerId` returns
  the banner byte for byte, so a driver that states nothing keeps every entry it has
  written. Appending an empty field would re-key every cache in the fleet to buy
  nothing.
- **`cc` and `c++` name a policy, not a product, so the banner decides.** On macOS
  `/usr/bin/c++` is Apple clang and is CMake's default; by name it lands in the
  `gcc` row. That was harmless while the two rows were identical and stopped being
  harmless when that row began deciding how a target is found. The correction is a
  string test over the banner already in hand, never a second spawn — and it must
  not touch `clang-cl`, whose banner is `clang version ...` byte for byte as plain
  clang's, so the NAME is the only thing separating those two drivers. Correcting
  the flavour *after* the line is parsed is safe only because the `gcc` and `clang`
  rows agree on every column the parse reads; a test asserts that, and if it ever
  fails the correction has to move above `ParseCommand`.
- **The banner and the triple come from ONE `-###` spawn on a `ClangDriverLine`
  driver, and that is safe only because a CHECK says so.** The launcher is one
  process per translation unit, so the second probe was a second spawn per unit of
  the whole build — measured 34.2 ms down to 22.4 ms per unit on Windows/clang++
  and 51.8 to 40.1 on clang-cl, both native NTFS; 133.3 to 112.5 on WSL2 over
  **DrvFs, which is a SLOW PATH and must not be differenced against the NTFS rows**
  — every per-file operation there costs an order of magnitude more, so read each
  row against itself. The saving is one driver spawn everywhere; what differs is
  what a spawn costs. Confirmed by COUNT (4 compiler spawns before, 3 after) rather
  than left to a clock, which matters on a host that steps its wall clock. It is not a
  cache: nothing is remembered, so no staleness enters. GCC keeps both spawns (its
  `-###` leads with `Using built-in specs.`), `cl` has neither flag, and `cc`/`c++`
  classify as `Gcc` BY NAME so they keep both too — `ProbeDriverIdentity` dispatches
  before any banner exists to correct it with, which is the same ordering the bullet
  above turns on.
  - **No fingerprint bump rides with it, and `banner-probe-identity` is what pays
    for that.** The banner reaches `ComputeKey`, `ComputeManifestKey` and
    `ComputeToolchainFingerprint`, so a driver whose `-###` first line is not its
    `--version` first line puts every client permanently out of agreement with every
    worker — #226's failure mode, silent, no counter moving. Bumping unconditionally
    would discard every stored object to record a change that, if the lines are
    identical, did not happen; so the property is CHECKED on every machine that runs
    the suite instead, skipped-and-named where no such driver exists. **Deleting that
    check does not simplify anything — it reopens the bump question in silence.** A
    driver found disagreeing is a finding for whoever owns the fleet, never something
    to absorb by adjusting the check.
  - Its candidate rule is NARROWER than `ClassifyCompilerImpl`'s, deliberately and
    with a stated cost: an exact stem plus a `-<digit>` suffix. Production's rule
    accepts anything after a `-`, which classifies `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` as
    Clang — measured, both exit 1 on `-###` while every real driver exits 0, so the
    merge condition excludes them anyway. What the narrowing gives up is a real
    merged-path driver under an unguessable name; `clang-cpp` is the in-tree example.
- **The two halves are framed, not concatenated.** `("ab", "c")` and `("a", "bc")`
  would otherwise key alike. A newline separates them because a banner is one line
  by construction and a triple is `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, so neither half can contain it.
- **The preprocessed text does not discriminate, so do not lean on it.** `_MSC_VER`
  changes with the compatibility version but need not survive preprocessing: a TU
  including `<cstdio>` preprocesses to **byte-identical** text at 19.29 and 19.51.
  The hazard is not confined to include-free translation units.
- **The triple is folded verbatim, and over-specification is the deliberate half.**
  Clang's Microsoft ABI gates on major.minor, so two MSVC builds differing only in
  patch generate identically and key apart — a lost match on every Visual Studio
  point release. It is not truncated because the same field means something else
  elsewhere: on Apple targets it is the **deployment target**, which does change code
  generation. One rule cannot serve both, and a per-platform rule would be guessing
  about triples this code has never seen. Over-specifying costs a recompile;
  under-specifying serves an object built by a different code generator.
- **Failing open is safe in ONE direction only.** A probe that answers nothing on
  one end leaves that end keying as it did before, so the two machines key apart and
  stop sharing — a miss. Answering nothing on **both** ends puts both back on the
  banner alone, which is the original defect, in silence. It never turns a working
  match into a wrong one and never repairs a pair that was already wrong, so a
  driver that has a mechanism and declined to use it is reported.
- **The probe is not cached, and the reason is the direction of the error.** The
  fingerprint's stamp covers the compiler binary and its include roots, none of
  which move when the MSVC install beside `clang-cl` is upgraded — so a triple
  memoized against it goes stale in the one direction that yields a *wrong hit*
  rather than a miss. It costs a second driver spawn per invocation on a clang
  driver, beside the `--version` one already paid there.
  - **This is the canonical instance of *expense is not the criterion*, and it is
    expensive**: `DiscoverTargetTriple` has been recorded at **~40 ms per translation
    unit** ([#188](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/188)), which
    on a whole build is the kind of number that argues for a memo on its own. It is
    deliberately not memoized anyway, because the triple goes into `compilerId` and a
    stale one is a **wrong hit, not a miss**. What decides is what a stale answer
    *does*, never what a fresh one costs — the rule stated in general under
    *Prefer not needing the cache at all* below.
    - That `~40 ms` figure arrived here from `AGENT.md` **with no conditions
      recorded** — no host, no driver, no filesystem — so it is a magnitude and not a
      measurement, and it must not be differenced against the per-unit rows above,
      which were taken on named hosts and name their own spread. Pin conditions to it
      before quoting it anywhere a decision turns on the number rather than on its
      order of magnitude.

## What the key is a function of

<!-- agent-tripwire: Only machine-independent dependency paths are hashed, and a path is classified by what it *resolves to*, never by its spelling -->

- **A key determines two artefacts, so it must be a function of both.** Preprocessing
  suppresses line markers (`-E -P`, `/EP`) so a checkout path never reaches the key —
  which is what makes a key portable, and equally what made it *invariant under a header
  move*. Move a header without changing a byte of it and the token stream is identical:
  the object is still correct and was served, while the depfile, which is nothing but
  paths, named a file that is gone. That is worse than a miss, because Ninja records the
  dependency, cannot stat it, rebuilds, hits the same value, and never converges — with a
  successful exit code every time. The dependency path set is therefore part of the key
  (`objkey-v6`, `KeyInputs::dependencyPaths`), captured on the preprocess run the launcher
  already makes rather than in a second probe: measured at **+1.5% on a 45 ms preprocess**,
  because the compiler has already opened every one of those files. A move is a different
  key by construction, so the *pre-move* entry survives the move rather than being
  overwritten — which is the property `check_header_move` asserts by moving the header
  back and requiring a HIT. Anchored as `pace-cc: HIT`: the launcher prints
  `STALE HIT (...); recompiling` on its way to a MISS, so a bare `grep HIT` is satisfied by
  exactly the collapse the case exists to reject. `ComputeManifestKey`'s `manifest-v*` tag moves
  in lock-step with `objkey-v*` for a related reason — a manifest stores the object key
  *by value* and its own key never sees the object-key schema, so a manifest written by an
  older launcher keeps resolving to an older object; direct mode is on by default and
  short-circuits before the preprocessed path,
  so without the second bump the re-key never happens where it matters most. The coupling is
  ONE-WAY, though, and the tags read `objkey-v8` and `manifest-v9`: an `objkey` bump must drag the manifest
  tag with it, while the reverse is free — and free is the direction `v5` itself moved in
  (issue #111), the manifest half forced and the object half taken only to keep the two from
  sitting numerically apart.
  - **Which paths are hashed is the whole subtlety, and the exclusion cuts the opposite
    way from the inclusion.** `KeyDependencySet` normalizes each path through
    `DirectManifest`'s `NormalizePath` **first** — a driver echoes a path as *resolved*, so
    `build/../inc/a.hpp` and `./inc/a.hpp` arrive verbatim, and unnormalized they are two
    key entries for one header and two different keys on two machines whose generators
    spell an include directory differently. Then it keeps a path that canonicalizes to a
    `<SRCROOT>`/`<BUILDTREE>` token and **drops** toolchain content, judged by
    `DirectManifest`'s own `ClassifyAgainstRoots` so that this filter, the manifest's and the
    replay guard's cannot disagree: a path under neither root, *and* a vcpkg tree nested
    under the build tree, which canonicalizes but is still the producing machine's. That is
    content already covered collectively by the compiler identity in the key, and hashing it
    would mean two machines with the same compiler at different install prefixes share
    *nothing at all* — 476 of a real TU's 635 headers are toolchain, and a manifest naming
    them would be machine-specific. The set is sorted and deduplicated because
    `/showIncludes` repeats a header once per inclusion site and emission order is a
    property of the driver.
    - **Sharing the classifier is not sharing the QUESTION, and the missing half was
      "under a root".** The launcher's path classifier answered it with a bare `starts_with` and no
      segment-boundary check while `PathCanon::Canonicalize` — which every one of the three
      then hands the path to — has always required the boundary, so under a source root
      `/home/dev/proj` the sibling `/home/dev/project-x/a.hpp` was project content to the
      classifier and under no root to the canonicalizer
      ([#562](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/562)). It failed SAFE
      — `starts_with` only ever classifies *more* paths as project content, so such a header
      was hashed and revalidated rather than dropped, and the unsafe direction (a project
      header called toolchain, which revalidates forever) could not be produced by it. What
      it cost was the invariant this bullet states, and an invariant false in one of three
      places is not available to reason from in the other two. One
      `PathCanon::RelateToLayout` now answers it — a `RootRelation` rather
      than a `bool`, for the reason below — taking NATIVE forms on purpose: `IsSegmentPrefix`
      sees only comparison
      forms whose separator is `/`, while `DirectManifest`'s `ToComparable` folds to `\`
      to match its backslash-spelled toolchain markers, so handing one's comparison form to
      the other asks for a boundary byte that cannot be there. Do not "unify separator
      handling" into `IsSegmentPrefix`; its single-separator test is correct for its input
      domain and a second branch there would be dead.
      - **The near miss the bug produced is kept, and is now ASKED rather than inferred.**
        `PathDisposition::Uncanonical` and `ManifestFault::Uncanonical` used to be whatever
        fell out of the gap between the two predicates. They are the one root fault of the
        three an operator repairs by editing a *root*, so closing the gap without naming the
        state would have turned a typo'd root into `outside roots` and sent them looking for
        a file that is exactly where they put it. `RootRelation::NearMiss` is that question
        asked directly, and the "under neither" half is load-bearing, since a build tree
        spelled as the source root's sibling makes a path a near miss of one root and
        legitimately under the other — which is why `RelateToLayout` answers `Under` before
        `NearMiss` rather than looping at the call site. The three consumers then agree the
        path lies outside the roots while still reporting *which* kind of outside.
      - **And the near miss is READ OFF the classification, never asked afterwards.**
        `Cc::ClassifyAgainstRoots` returns `Project` / `NearMissRoot` / `Toolchain` in one
        answer, with the marker scan winning, because a marker match re-examined against the
        roots is overruled by them: `<root>-deps/vcpkg_installed/.../core.h` character-
        prefixes `<root>` with no boundary, so a separate near-miss call reported an
        ordinary vcpkg layout as a misspelled root — refusing every manifest that included
        it, and probing it in the replay guard so every hit was discarded on a machine whose
        dependencies sit elsewhere. A short source root (`C:\P`) makes that total: every
        Windows SDK header becomes a "near miss". Two questions of one path, answered by two
        calls, is how the second one gets to overrule the first — which is also why there is
        no `IsNearMissRoot` predicate, and no `IsToolchainHeader` beside it any more (#657):
        a bool-returning name invites a caller to reintroduce exactly that shape, and it
        cannot say WHICH of the two non-project answers it got. Ask once, read the
        enumerator.
      - **The replay guard still probes such a path, and that is a difference of QUESTION,
        not of predicate.** Its exclusion of outside-roots paths rests on the toolchain stamp
        covering them collectively, so a machine with a different toolchain has a different
        key and never sees the value; a near miss is covered by nothing, so the argument does
        not reach it and skipping it would replay a path naming a file that may be elsewhere
        here — issue #53 exactly. The manifest REFUSES over one for the mirror reason: a
        dropped near miss leaves a hit revalidating everything except the header being
        edited, so it is the only outside-roots path that is a refusal rather than a drop.
      - **A fourth spelling was looked for and one exists, deliberately.**
        `NormalizeForLayout`'s helper decides "inside a root" with `weakly_canonical` +
        `lexically_relative` — filesystem identities rather than spellings, and it needs the
        TAIL rather than a bool. Different question, stated at the site; not a copy.
    - **The compiler identity that "covers" them is a string a compiler had to say, so
      every driver is asked the one way it answers**
      ([#195](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/195)). Dropping 476
      of 635 headers rests entirely on the clause above, and the identity doing the
      covering is `CompilerBanner` — `main.cpp`'s `toolchainStamp`, which is what
      `ComputeKey`, `ComputeManifestKey` and `ValidateManifest` all fold in. `cl` has no
      `--version`: asked for one it prints its banner, then errors, then exits 2, and the
      banner requires a **zero exit** so a driver that cannot answer falls back to its
      normalized basename rather than fingerprinting on an error message. So every MSVC
      compiler ever installed identified as the string `cl` — and an MSVC key covered
      neither the toolchain headers (dropped) nor the compiler (a constant). Measured: a
      TU compiled under 14.51 was STORED, and the identical compile under 14.44 HIT the
      same key and received an object embedding `_MSC_FULL_VER` 195136252, which 14.44
      cannot produce. Zero exit code, no diagnostic. The gate is right; the probe was
      wrong, and how to ask is now `DriverSpec::versionFlags` — MSVC's row **empty**,
      because bare `cl` prints the same banner and exits 0. The banner names the target
      too ("... for x64"), which is the only thing separating the x86 and x64 `cl.exe` of
      one toolset: those two share an include tree exactly, so a fingerprint could not
      tell them apart either and a fleet dispatched between them.
    - **A relative path is classified by what it resolves to, never by its spelling** —
      which is why `KeyDependencySet` takes a working directory at all, threaded from
      `RunCached` through `CompileWorkingDirectory()`, the one place `main.cpp` answers
      that question for both this filter and the replay guard. Both rules above ask what a
      path *names*; "is it absolute" answers a different question, and the two invert for a
      vendored or relocatable toolchain reached through a relative include path (issue
      #64). `-isystem ../toolchain/include` makes the driver report
      `../toolchain/include/foo.h`, which lies under no root — so a spelling test *kept and
      hashed* the very file it drops when the driver spells the same header
      `/home/dev/toolchain/include/foo.h`, and a build tree at a different depth then keyed
      every TU that touches it differently. Resolving first collapses the two branches into
      one: a relative project header becomes the token its absolute spelling would produce
      (so one header reached two ways is one entry), and a relative toolchain header is
      dropped exactly as an absolute one is. What the key gives up — a *vendored* header
      move no longer re-keys — is what `Cc::MissingReplayedDependency` still covers, since
      it probes a relative replayed path for existence before writing anything; the same
      trade and the same backstop the absolute exclusion has always had. Two mechanics are
      load-bearing: the resolution is **lexical**, because `weakly_canonical` would rewrite
      an 8.3 short component to its long form and break the prefix tests two bullets down;
      and it runs on `/`-folded text, because `std::filesystem` treats `\` as a separator
      only on a Windows *host*, so a Windows path normalized on POSIX keeps its `..`
      segments and canonicalizes to `<BUILDTREE>/../../inc/a.hpp` — a token naming a file
      the path does not name. Two further host couplings live in that same lexical pass and
      were each *measured* on libc++ rather than assumed. `lexically_normal` collapses a
      leading `//` on POSIX and keeps it on Windows, where it is a UNC root name, so the
      root is carried across the pass by hand — without that, a `\\server\share` layout
      stops prefix-matching its own root on one host, classifies every project header as
      toolchain, and hands back an empty set. And the absoluteness test is asked **before**
      the collapse rather than after, because `C:/../x` normalizes to a bare `x` on POSIX
      (`C:` is an ordinary filename there for `..` to eat) while Windows cannot ascend past
      a drive root and keeps `C:/x` — so collapsing first sends an absolute path down the
      resolve-against-the-working-directory branch on one host only. Asking first is also
      what makes the relative branch normalize once, after the join, instead of on each
      side of it. The tags moved to `objkey-v4`/`manifest-v4` for this change, in the
      lock-step the manifest bullet above describes — but note which half forced it. The
      *dependency-set* re-key would not have needed a bump on its own: it changes a key only
      for a translation unit that reported a relative path, and those keys differ by
      construction, so a stale entry becomes unreachable rather than servable under rules it
      was not written by. The manifest half is what required it, and `objkey` follows the
      manifest here rather than the other way round. A working directory that is empty or
      itself relative drops
      every relative path rather than guessing, and the `dependency set: N of M` note is
      what keeps that from being silent. The *residual*, recorded deliberately: a relative
      include-dir argument (`-I../../vendor/sdk/include`) still reaches the key verbatim
      through `RelativizeArgs`, which canonicalizes only paths it can resolve — absolute
      ones — so two machines whose build directories sit at different depths still key
      apart on the arguments even though the dependency set now agrees. Closing that means
      resolving arguments against the same working directory, which is a separate change to
      a separate function.
  - **"Absolute or relative" is the wrong question on Windows, because there are three
    answers.** `C:foo` carries a drive specifier and is still not rooted: it resolves against
    *that drive's* current directory, per-process state on the producing machine that no
    cache entry records. `PathCanon::AnchorForLayout` therefore returns an `Anchor` —
    `WorkingDirectory`, `Absolute`, `DriveRelative` — where it used to return a `bool
    IsAbsoluteForLayout` whose drive test stopped at the colon and so reported all three
    Windows shapes as absolute (issue #65). Every caller switches on it with no `default:`, so
    a fourth state is a compile error at each rather than a silent fall-through. What none of
    them may do is treat it as `WorkingDirectory`, and since issue #64 that branch does
    something stronger than keep a spelling — it *resolves* the path against the compile's
    working directory, which for `C:foo` names a file that was never read. Hashing the
    spelling instead, as it used to, would let two machines whose `C:` cwd differs key
    **identically for different headers**, the same silent cross-TU mis-serve #63 closed by a
    different route. Either way the answer is the same: a drive-relative path is neither.
    **Past that the callers part, and
    the asymmetry is the substance of the fix.** The key filter needs a portable *spelling*,
    so it leaves the path to the root tests — root membership is the stronger question, and
    under a drive-relative *root* (`C:src\proj`, a Windows root by its separators) the path
    canonicalizes to a token that is portable precisely because the consumer substitutes its
    own root. Dropping on the anchor alone would have silently un-keyed that whole layout,
    and it is what the first cut of this change did. The replay guard needs something to
    *stat*, which a drive-relative path is not under any working directory it could be handed
    — `std::filesystem::operator/` reaches a drive's current directory by no route: on POSIX
    the join names nothing that exists, on Windows it resolves against the *process* cwd — so
    it skips, under the existing rule that a path which cannot be examined counts as present.
    For a drive-relative root that arm is a behaviour *change*: such a path used to be probed
    against the wrong anchor and discarded every hit carrying it. The **manifest** is the
    third caller and sides with the key filter, on the same reasoning read through its own
    failure mode: it *opens* a path rather than probing one, and an unreadable entry refuses
    the manifest while recording (`HashFileContents` yields nothing) and fails to validate
    while reading — safe in both directions — so the stronger root question is worth asking,
    and dropping on the anchor alone would silently un-cover a project header, which is the
    defect its own bullet below exists to close.
    - **What that left over is closed by refusing the compile, not by covering the path
      (issue #104).** A drive-relative path under no root was dropped from the key AND skipped
      by the replay guard — each filter right on its own terms, and nothing anywhere asking
      whether SOMETHING covered the path. A header moved inside it does not re-key, so the
      stale entry is still found, and nothing probes it, so nothing notices: a replayed depfile
      naming a file that is gone, under a zero exit code. Covering it is not available — it
      would mean recording the producing machine's per-drive cwd in the value, which is exactly
      the machine-specific state the key exists to keep out — so the compile is refused
      instead, the way a module interface unit is, and says so under `PACE_VERBOSE`. Six
      things about its shape are load-bearing:
      - **It is a ROOT test that begins with an anchor test, and both halves cut opposite
        ways.** Refusing on the anchor alone would take a drive-relative *root* (`C:src\proj`)
        out of the cache wholesale, and that layout is portable precisely because the consumer
        substitutes its own root. Asking the roots alone would refuse every compile that
        reaches a system header. The anchor comes first for a second reason as well:
        `AnchorForLayout` never reports `DriveRelative` under a POSIX layout, so the whole rule
        is inert there without a single canonicalization.
      - **The question is asked TWICE, of two different inputs, and neither ask is redundant.**
        The dependency-set ask is the authoritative one: it sees the paths the compiler actually
        opened, so no list of flag spellings has to be complete for it to be right — which
        matters, because `CouldNameAFile` already records in as many words that such a list is
        what cannot be kept complete. `Cc::UnkeyableArgument` asks it of the command line
        instead, and buys the ORDERING: direct mode runs before the preprocess and validates a
        manifest whose entries came through the same filter and therefore dropped the very path
        in question, so a manifest recorded by an older launcher would keep direct-hitting a
        stale object forever. Asking before direct mode retires those entries by making them
        unreachable.
      - **The two asks share ONE classifier, and issue #105 is what made that possible.**
        `PortableForm` already names this exact case `PathDisposition::DriveRelative`, so
        `RunCached` reads that tally rather than walking the paths again — two spellings of
        one classification are two places for it to drift, which is the defect
        `DispositionTable` exists to prevent. `Cc::IsDriveRelativeUnderNoRoot` remains only for
        the input the tally cannot answer for: an argument whose path the compiler never
        reported. Both reach `RootToken`, so "did a root place this" has one definition and not
        two. Note what #105 did and did not do here: it gave the drop its own NAME, which made
        the fault legible and this fix expressible — naming a drop is not covering it, and on
        its own the path still reached the key filter as a drop.
      - **No schema tag moved for the refusal itself**, and that is what the command-line ask
        bought: nothing about the key's construction, the value's framing or its canonicalization
        changed, and an affected compile simply stops consulting the cache. Closing the *whole*
        thing by bumping instead would have re-keyed every entry on every platform for a
        clang-cl-only exposure. A bump was still needed afterwards — for the direct-mode residual
        below, and not for the refusal. See the `v5` bullet.
      - **The regression test asserts the CONJUNCTION, because the defect was never inside a
        filter.** A table of the shapes a driver can report, each declaring what covers it —
        keyed, guarded, the toolchain stamp, or refused — and there is deliberately no
        `Nothing` enumerator, because a row nothing covers is the defect rather than a fifth
        kind of row. `ToolchainStamp` is a *claim* about content, true of a toolchain header at
        a fixed address and false of a path nothing can place. Verified by neutering the
        predicate and watching those two rows, and only them, change answer.
      - **`v5` closes the direct-mode residual the refusal could not reach (issue #111), and
        both tags move.** The authoritative ask runs after `TryDirectMode`, and the command-line
        ask can only see a path an *argument* carries — so a drive-relative header arriving some
        other way (an `#include "C:foo/x.h"` written out in the source, a fused flag spelling
        `PathValueFlags()` does not know) kept direct-hitting a manifest an older launcher
        recorded. That manifest was invisible to its own key for exactly the reason the `v4`
        bullet gives for its generation: the refusal changes neither `canonicalSource` nor the
        args, so the entry keeps its key and keeps being found, and `ValidateManifest` still
        validates it because the offending path was dropped from the manifest too and there is
        nothing left to fail on. Re-keying is the only thing that retires it. Four consequences:
        - **The bump had to land at or after the refusal, never before it.** A `v5` manifest
          written by a launcher without the refusal carries the identical defect, and there
          would be no tag left to retire *that* — the one retirement event would have been spent
          on the wrong generation. With the refusal underneath, such a compile is never cached
          at all, so the `v5` population is clean by construction.
        - **`objkey` moved too, and nothing forced it.** The manifest half is the whole of the
          fix; the object key's construction, framing and canonicalization are all unmoved. It
          is taken because the standing argument at the `objkey` tag decides it — two tags
          sitting numerically apart is a state nobody should have to reason about later — and
          the cold rebuild it costs is one the manifest bump has already committed every user to
          paying, so it rides in that invalidation event rather than ever costing a second.
        - **The issue recommended the opposite and was overruled at the tag, not silently.** It
          argued for moving `manifest` alone, since re-keying objects invalidates every entry on
          every platform for a clang-cl-only exposure. That asymmetry is real, but it is an
          argument about one invalidation event weighed once, while the tags-apart hazard is
          carried by every later reader and does not expire.
        - **A golden vector does not pin a bump; a retired-generation table does.** Reverting
          the tag and re-pasting the vector is one edit two hunks apart and leaves the suite
          green. `Testing::Generation` in `src/tests/RetiredGenerations.hpp` is a row per
          generation each key space has retired, and `RequireNoRetiredDigest` requires the live
          key to equal none of them, so restoring an old tag reproduces a retired digest and
          fails whatever the golden says. **That check is only a guard where the digested
          inputs are FROZEN**, as this case's `KeyInputs` are; where they GROW it is vacuous,
          which is why the stored-value table one section down asserts structurally instead
          (#548, and the header states the distinction at the helper rather than at either
          caller). Rows reach back only to `v3`, because issue #63 moved the digest itself
          and `v2` and earlier are unreachable by construction rather than by tag.
    - One diagnostic consequence of the drop that used to happen: the launcher's
      `dependency set: 0 of M reported path(s) keyed` line was reachable for a second reason,
      so that fingerprint stopped identifying the #66 short-name mismatch on its own. The two
      were then told apart only by whether the *root* was short-name spelled, which requires
      knowing to ask — the opposite of what a fingerprint is for. Closed by the counter
      carrying its *reasons* now; see the `PathDisposition` bullet below.
    - **The ASCII rules are one rule each, and the drive-letter one had drifted into four.**
      Two of the four spellings tested it with `std::isalpha`, which is **locale-dependent** — in a codebase
      whose whole premise is that two machines derive the same key from the same content, a
      classification that varies with the running process's locale is a classification they
      can disagree about. `PathCanon::IsDriveLetter` is now the single definition and every
      site takes the letter test from it. What each site adds on top deliberately differs and
      that is not drift: `AnchorForLayout` and `IsWindowsRoot` also ask what *follows* the
      colon, while the two depfile rule-splitters do not — they are deciding where a rule
      ends, and `C:foo` is one token there however it is anchored. The one place the two
      root-shaped tests genuinely part is a bare `C:`: as a layout **root** it is the
      degenerate spelling of the drive root and `IsWindowsRoot` accepts it, while as a
      **path** the same bytes name the drive's current directory and `AnchorForLayout` calls
      it `DriveRelative`. Both halves are pinned against the *same layout* in one test, so
      the shared helpers cannot quietly merge them in either direction. The same reasoning
      moved `PathCanon::AsciiLower` into the header beside it: the classifier's
      comparison form was folding case through `std::tolower`, and under a Turkish locale
      `std::tolower('I')` is not `i` — so a root spelled `D:\PROJECT\Inc` folds one way on
      one machine and another way on the next, and the two derive different manifests and
      different dependency sets from byte-identical content. A locale-sensitive
      classification is the same defect as a host-sensitive one, and this layer exists to
      have neither.
  - **A stream driver's notes must not reach the hashed text, and which stream carries them
    is not the driver table's answer to give.** No field encodes it -- `DriverSpec` carries
    no `includeStream`, and the claim lives only in `Flavor`'s doc comments and the driver
    table in `docs/tools/pace-cc.md`, both of which describe the *compile* run; the probe is a different command line and clang moves the notes off
    whichever stream the preprocessed text is using — measured, `clang-cl /c /showIncludes`
    reports on **stdout** while `clang-cl /EP /showIncludes` reports on **stderr** (LLVM
    D46394). Routing the probe by that table therefore read an empty set on clang-cl and
    made this whole key input a silent no-op there. So `Preprocess` guesses at nothing: it
    splits stdout unconditionally (a byte-exact no-op on a stream with no notes) and unions
    the notes from both — which is the treatment `RecordManifest` already gives the same
    question, "rather than guessing which compiler produced this value". A note left in the
    text would be keyed as if it were source, and it carries an absolute path, which is
    precisely what suppressing line markers exists to prevent.
  - **Which channel a driver writes `/showIncludes` on is stated ONCE -- here -- and the two
    halves of the answer do not have the same evidence.** MEASURED, and the bullet above is
    the reading: `clang-cl /c /showIncludes` reports on **stdout**, `clang-cl /EP
    /showIncludes` on **stderr** (LLVM D46394). **NOT MEASURED: `cl`.** Three sites assert it
    writes on stderr -- `Flavor::Cl`'s doc comment, the driver table in
    `docs/tools/pace-cc.md`, and the stored-region comment in `pace-cc/main.cpp`
    -- while the analysis on #700 and the review of #821 both say stdout. Nobody on this team
    has a Windows host, so **no reading has been taken either way**. The measurement is
    committed as `scripts/probes/msvc-showincludes-channel.ps1`, unrun -- it identifies a
    note by the header it NAMES rather than by the English prefix, so it answers for a
    localized `cl` too, and it re-measures the `clang-cl` halves as CONTROLS: if those
    disagree with D46394 the probe is wrong and its `cl` rows prove nothing. Those three sites now
    say so instead of restating the claim: a claim stated in three places needs a correction
    that finds all three, which is how a wrong one survives being corrected. It is inert
    today because both regions are tagged `ShowIncludes` whichever stream carries the notes
    -- and it stopped being inert the moment #821 built a dispatch refusal fed from stderr
    alone, which is why it is written down rather than left to be rediscovered.
    **MEASURED** on `Windows-cl-debug` (`windows-2025`, MSVC toolset 14.44) by
    `scripts/probes/msvc-showincludes-channel.ps1`, and the answer is neither of the
    two the tree was arguing about
    ([#825](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/825)):

    <!-- table-total: none -->
    | driver | flag | channel |
    |---|---|---|
    | `cl` | `/c` | **stdout** |
    | `cl` | `/EP` | **stderr** |
    | `clang-cl` | `/c` | stdout |
    | `clang-cl` | `/EP` | stderr |

    **The channel follows the FLAG, not the driver.** Both drivers put the notes on
    stdout when compiling and move them to stderr under `/EP`, where stdout carries the
    preprocessed text and a note on it would corrupt that text. The three sites said
    "`cl` on stderr"; #700 and the #821 review said "`cl` on stdout"; each was half
    right and neither had the rule. That is what makes a claim restated in three places
    dangerous — none of the three was placed to notice the question had a second
    variable.

    The `clang-cl` rows are the CONTROL and agree with LLVM D46394, so the run is
    trustworthy; had they disagreed the `cl` rows would prove nothing. The note is
    identified by the header it NAMES rather than by the English prefix, so the reading
    holds for a localized `cl` too.

    It stays inert at the one site that reads it, because both regions carry one tag
    whichever stream carries the notes -- `Grammar::MsvcStream` since value generation 6,
    which reads notes on either stream and diagnostics too (below, *A stream region's
    grammar must cover EVERY line language*). What sharpens is #821's shape: a
    dispatch refusal fed from **stderr alone** is now known to be wrong for a COMPILE
    and right only for a `/EP` run — a firmer statement than "it may not fire for `cl`".
  - **The note grammar is one rule, not one string, and it is anchored at COLUMN ZERO.**
    `SplitIncludeNotes` and `ParseIncludePaths` both call `IncludeNotePath`, which is
    `PathCanon::IncludeNoteMarkerEnd` — the same function the grammar and the marker rewrite
    use, in the other binary — and it admits **nothing** in front of the marker, blanks
    included. Anything in front is safe on a pure note stream and a mis-serve on the one that
    also carries preprocessed *source*: it deletes an ordinary line out of the hashed bytes, so
    two revisions differing only in that line key identically and the second is served the
    first's object. Both shapes are reachable rather than hypothetical — a mid-line rule is
    tripped by this repository's own sources, which contain the literal, and a leading-blank
    rule by any indented raw string literal whose continuation line begins with the marker,
    which is what a C++ line inside a function looks like ([#1270](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1270)).
    Inclusion depth is not a reason to loosen it: `cl` puts the depth AFTER the marker, and the
    measurement is two sections down.
  - **A manifest that names no dependency is refused, not recorded.** A direct hit
    revalidates exactly what its manifest lists, so a manifest built from the source alone
    replays an object whose headers nobody re-checked — edit a header, leave the `.cpp`
    untouched, and the stale object is served forever with a zero exit code. That is what a
    build passing neither `-MD`/`-MF` nor `/showIncludes` produces: no stream carries notes
    and there is no depfile to read. `RecordManifest` returns instead, which costs that build
    direct mode (a permanent manifest miss, resolved by the ordinary preprocessed key) and is
    the one shape where recording nothing is strictly better than recording something. The
    launcher never injects those flags itself — the compile runs the build system's own argv,
    so what it can revalidate is bounded by what the build asked the compiler to report.
  - **A manifest classifies a path's anchor before asking whether it is toolchain content,
    and the working directory is what makes that answerable.** `ClassifyAgainstRoots` calls
    every path outside both roots toolchain, and a *relative* path lies under no root, so
    asking it first reported every relative path as toolchain and dropped it. A GNU build
    whose depfile carried relative header paths — a relative `-I`, or a compile run from the
    source directory, which is also how the CMake Ninja generator spells its sources —
    therefore recorded a manifest of its absolute entries alone, and an empty manifest
    validates against anything: edit a dropped header, leave the `.cpp` untouched, and the
    direct hit serves the previous object under a zero exit code, *permanently*, because a
    direct hit never reaches `RecordManifest` to repair the manifest that let it through.
    `Cc::IsCheckable` and `Cc::PortableForm` are the other two consumers of that classifier
    and both already ordered it this way, in as many words; this was the third and did not
    (issue #57 is the same defect reaching the TU source rather than a header). The
    classification is now three-valued — `Project` / `Toolchain` / `Unanchored` — for the same
    reason `PathCanon::Anchor` is, and built on it: "outside both roots" and "not placeable at
    all" are different facts with opposite consequences, and collapsing them to two is
    precisely what went wrong. `PathRole` is not a second spelling of `Anchor` — `Anchor`
    describes the path, `PathRole` decides what the manifest does about it — and the mapping
    between them is the switch, which carries no `default:` for the reason the other two
    callers' do not.
    - **A resolved relative path is recorded as a canonical token, not kept relative** —
      the opposite of what `KeyDependencySet` does with the same input, deliberately. A key
      input is only ever *digested*; a manifest entry has to be *localized back to a file*
      on the validating machine, which a relative entry can only do against that machine's
      working directory. `cc -c ../src/t.cpp` run from `build/` and from `build/sub/`
      relativizes to the same argument list and so shares a manifest key while naming
      different files — resolving before canonicalizing is what removes that, and it is why
      `CanonicalSourceToken` is one function both `TryDirectMode` and `RecordManifest` call
      rather than two spellings of `PathCanon::Canonicalize(cmd.source, …)`.
    - **An unanchored path refuses the manifest rather than being dropped.** Reachable only
      when the working directory itself is unavailable, so it costs essentially nothing —
      and dropping is the silent stale serve this whole classification exists to prevent,
      while refusing merely costs one compile direct mode.
    - **`current_path()` must be re-spelled in the layout's vocabulary before anything
      compares it against a root.** `getcwd(3)` answers with the kernel's *resolved* path,
      so a build under a symlinked prefix (macOS `/tmp` → `/private/tmp`, any symlinked
      `/home` or `/mnt`) reports a working directory sharing no string prefix with the root
      it is actually inside — and every root test here and in `PathCanon` is a string prefix
      comparison. `AnchorWorkingDirectory` matches by filesystem *identity*
      (`weakly_canonical` on both sides, longest root first as `CanonicalizeOne` does) and
      hands back the **root's own spelling** with the tail appended, so the one value that
      comes from the environment speaks the same language as the ones that come from
      configuration. Found by `compile-cache-e2e.sh` on macOS, where `mktemp -d` returns a
      `/var/…` path and `getcwd` reports `/private/var/…`; it silently cost direct mode
      rather than failing, which is why it is asserted end-to-end. This is *not* a fix for
      issue #66 — that is about the paths a **driver emits**, where both sides would have to
      move together; here only the cwd is re-spelled, and against roots that are already the
      layout's own.
    - **The "normalize, then put the layout's separators back" rule is spelled once,
      in `NormalizeForLayout`.** `std::filesystem` answers with the **host's** preferred
      separator while every root and absoluteness test is the **layout's**, so on a
      Windows host `/w/src/a.hpp` comes back backslash-separated and
      `IsAbsoluteForLayout` — which for a POSIX layout asks only about a leading `/` —
      reads an absolute path as relative. `PortableForm` had the only copy, inline, and
      the manifest side turned out not to have it; Windows CI is what said so, on this
      very change. The correction runs **one way only, deliberately**: a Windows layout
      keeps whatever separators it arrived with, because `PathCanon` spells a Windows
      root either way (`C:/src/proj` is a Windows layout) and every prefix test unifies
      separators before comparing — only the POSIX direction can mislead, since there a
      backslash is an ordinary filename character rather than a separator spelled
      differently. `ResolveAgainst`'s *join* stays the host's path arithmetic on
      purpose, and its contract says so: it resolves against a directory on this machine
      and its result is handed straight to `HashFileContents`, so it only ever runs
      where the layout and the host agree.
    - **`manifest-v4` moved alone, and the lock-step with `objkey-v*` is one-way.** An
      `objkey` bump must drag the manifest tag with it (a manifest points at an object key by
      value); the reverse costs nothing, since an unreachable manifest is re-recorded next
      compile and points at the same still-valid objects. The bump is *required* here because
      the defect is invisible to the key: a build with an absolute TU source but relative
      header paths keeps the same `canonicalSource` and args across this fix, so its
      under-recorded manifest keeps the same key, keeps being found, and keeps validating.
      Re-keying is the only thing that retires those entries.
    - **The emptiness guard did not move to a count, and that was the decision.**
      `RecordManifest` still refuses on `includes.empty()` — "did the compile report a
      dependency record at all?", which is the right question and `includes` is the right
      thing to ask it of. A count over `manifest.entries` cannot replace it: after the fix a
      one-entry manifest is *legitimate* (a TU whose every header is toolchain content is
      completely covered by that entry plus the stamp), so a threshold would refuse correct
      manifests while still not catching a misconfigured root. The zero-entry case it was
      standing in for is closed a layer down instead — `BuildManifest` takes the TU as its
      own `sourcePath` field and refuses when it cannot record it, which turns the invariant
      its doc-comment used to *state* into one it *enforces*. What the caller adds is a
      diagnostic, not a veto: `manifest: N entries from M reported dependency path(s) plus
      the source`, for the same reason the key's `dependency set: N of M` line exists — the
      recorded manifest cannot report this itself, because it still validates.
  - **`Cc::MissingReplayedDependency` stays as the backstop**, and still runs before a hit
    writes anything; a stale hit falls through to the real compile, whose STORE repairs the
    entry. Its filter is load-bearing in both directions: probing a depfile's rule target
    would make every hit a miss, because the target is the object file and it does not exist
    yet (hence `ParseDepFilePaths`, which excludes it, rather than a whitespace split);
    probing an absolute path outside both roots would make two machines with different system
    include prefixes miss on *every* compile forever, each re-storing the other's record.
    `/showIncludes` is covered alongside the depfile because Ninja reads it as `deps = msvc`;
    `MsvcDiagnostics` is not, because a diagnostic quotes a path rather than declaring a
    dependency on it.
  - **A hit reproduces BOTH artefacts or is not a hit** (#1531). A value with no depfile region
    is not served to a compile that names a depfile (`Cc::ReproducesDepFile`, asked before
    anything is written): it is `Stale`, so the real compile runs and its STORE repairs the
    entry. Served anyway, the object is correct and the depfile the build named is simply
    ABSENT -- and Ninja reading a `deps = gcc` depfile that is not there records no
    dependencies and says nothing, so every later header edit leaves the object stale. That is
    also what retired #1531's poisoned values without an `objkey-v*` bump: their key does not
    move, they fail this once each, and are replaced -- where a bump would have cost every
    platform a cold rebuild to retire entries one driver wrote.
  - **clang-cl under CMake's Ninja generator asks for a GNU DEPFILE, not `/showIncludes`**:
    `deps = gcc` and `-clang:-MD -clang:-MT<obj> -clang:-MF<dep>`, through the pass-through that
    hands one argument to the GNU driver inside clang-cl. Measured on CMake 4.2 (#1531). `cl`
    gets `/showIncludes` and `deps = msvc`, which is why only clang-cl broke. The pass-through
    spellings are `PathValueFlags()` rows (`joinedOnly`) and `MsvcDrop` rows, so every consumer
    of that table -- the parser, the key probe, the dispatched line, the key -- reads them as the
    flags they wrap. A separated `-clang:-MF -clang:<path>` wraps its VALUE too, which nothing
    unwraps, so it is refused as uncacheable rather than read as a path named `-clang:<path>`.
  - **The residual, recorded deliberately:** two machines whose compilers print the *same*
    `--version` banner from *different* install prefixes still share a key and can still
    replay each other's toolchain paths. Closing that would mean hashing those absolute
    paths, i.e. giving up cross-machine sharing wholesale for the population it affects, so
    the guard above is what covers it and the trade is left where `DirectManifest` already
    put it.
  - **A root must be spelled the way the driver spells what it emits, and on Windows the
    drivers disagree.** Every root test is a string prefix comparison
    (`ClassifyAgainstRoots`, `PathCanon::CanonicalizeOne`), so a root carrying an 8.3 short
    component matches nothing `cl` reports: `cl` resolves an include through the filesystem
    and prints `C:\Users\runneradmin\...`, while clang-cl echoes the spelling it was handed
    and prints `C:\Users\RUNNER~1\...`. Measured on a GitHub runner, where `%TEMP%` is the
    short form. Two failures follow from the one mismatch and they hide each other: every
    path is classified as outside both roots, so the keyed dependency set is **empty** (the
    two layouts of a moved header key together) *and* `ReplayGuard` skips every path it
    would have checked (so nothing reports it) — and the stored `/showIncludes` region is
    never canonicalized either, so the value carries the producing machine's absolute paths.
    Two symptoms to recognise it by, since neither the key nor the guard will say a word:
    a replayed note that kept the driver's mixed separators (`...\src\inc/h1.h`) was never
    tokenized, where a localized one is uniformly native (`...\src\inc\h1.h`); and the
    launcher's `dependency set: N of M reported path(s) keyed` line reads `0 of M` with M
    non-zero and every one of them counted `toolchain` — the probe reported paths and every
    one was filtered out, which is a different fault from `0 of 0` (a driver that reports
    nothing on the preprocess line) and, since the reasons were added, from a set that was
    `drive-relative` or `unanchored` instead.
    `run-launcher-e2e.ps1` therefore puts its scratch trees beside the **build tree**
    rather than under `%TEMP%`; it does not try to expand a short name, because nothing
    dependably does — `Resolve-Path`, `Get-Item` and `[IO.Path]::GetFullPath` all preserve
    it, and `Scripting.FileSystemObject` was tried and echoed it back unchanged.
  - **A drop that cannot say WHY it dropped is a counter, not a fingerprint.** `0 of M` was
    the fingerprint of the bullet above, and it was worth having precisely because #66 is
    silent from every other direction. Issue #65 then gave the same line a second cause — a
    drive-relative path under no root also drops — after which it identified neither: the two
    were tellable apart only by whether the *root* was short-name spelled, which requires
    knowing to ask, the opposite of what a fingerprint is for. `Cc::PathDisposition` names
    each outcome of the filter and the note reports the ones that happened, so
    `0 of 12 keyed (12 toolchain)` and `0 of 12 keyed (9 toolchain, 3 drive-relative)` are
    different lines (issue #105). It changes no key input and moves no schema tag; the key
    was right either way. Consequences that are each load-bearing:
    - **A table, sized from a `Last` sentinel and guarded by a `consteval` coverage check**,
      the shape `WorkerProtocol`'s `RefusalTable` and `Metrics/MetricsCatalog` already carry:
      a disposition that can be counted but not named is a drop that renders as nothing, which
      is the whole defect. The *sizing* is the half that has to be right, and `RefusalTable`'s
      spelling is the one not to copy — a length asserted against the final enumerator **by
      name** accepts a table one row short the moment an enumerator is appended after it, and
      the tally is indexed by the enumerator, so the new disposition writes one past the end.
      Derived from `Last`, the missing row value-initializes to `{ Keyed, "" }` at a non-zero
      index and the coverage check rejects it. Verified by adding an enumerator without a row
      and watching the build stop.
    - **The classifier was deliberately NOT split**, though the issue's illustration
      implies it. It is the one rule three callers must agree on, and separating "a marker
      matched" from "under neither root" does not isolate #66 anyway: under a short-name root
      a genuine `/usr/include` header and a project header both land outside the roots, so
      the split adds a column without adding a fingerprint. What separates the faults is
      anchor-shaped (`Unanchored`, `DriveRelative`) against content-shaped (`Toolchain`).
      The non-split is not free, though, and the bullet below is its price paid in full
      rather than recorded as a residual.
    - **A drive-relative path is reported as drive-relative only when it is also under no
      root, and the second half is what makes it precise.** Under no root the anchor is the
      only fact that says what to change, and calling it `toolchain` is the very word a
      short-name root produces — reporting it would re-collapse the two. Under a
      drive-relative *root* the path canonicalizes, so a marker match there is ordinary
      vendored content and `toolchain` is true; reporting THAT as drive-relative would put
      the loudest reading of the new vocabulary on a healthy build, which is the same defect
      from the other side. `ClassifyAgainstRoots` cannot separate them — it tests its markers
      before any root, deliberately — so the root question is asked again in that one
      branch, and only for a drive-relative path. That is the price of not splitting the
      classifier, and it is one extra root test on a shape no ordinary build produces: the
      toolchain drop, 476 of a real translation unit's 635 paths, still costs exactly one.
    - **`Uncanonical` is a third root-spelling fault that had no name at all.**
      `/x/build-other/a.h` under a `/x/build` root is a root off by a suffix, and while it
      counted as "toolchain" it was indistinguishable from an ordinary system header — though
      it is the one of the three an operator repairs by editing a root. It arrived here by
      accident at first: the classifier's prefix match was character-wise and
      `Canonicalize`'s segment-wise, so such a path fell out of the gap between them. That
      gap was itself the defect (#562, above) and is closed; the fault survived it by being
      asked for directly, as `Cc::ClassifyAgainstRoots`'s third outcome. A state produced by
      an inconsistency and a
      state produced by a predicate look identical from the outside and are not the same
      thing to reason about — the first is only ever as reliable as the bug.
    - **The tally counts reported OCCURRENCES**, so it sums to `M` while the keyed set is
      what survived sort-and-deduplicate. `/showIncludes` repeats a header once per inclusion
      site, so the two genuinely differ on every real translation unit and the note's numbers
      do **not** add up there — which the operator documentation says out loud, because a
      reader who assumes they should goes hunting for paths that vanished. `Reported()` is
      derived from the tally rather than carried beside it, because two counters for one fact
      are two counters that drift.
    - **The renderer lives in `DependencyProbe.cpp` rather than `main.cpp`**, the lesson
      `CacheProtocol.cpp` and `RootReconciler.cpp` are each recorded as having been extracted
      for, and each collapse was reintroduced to check the cases can see it: folding
      `DriveRelative` back into `Toolchain` fails exactly one case with `"2 toolchain"`,
      folding `Uncanonical` in fails exactly one other, and labelling a vendored tree under a
      drive-relative root by its anchor fails exactly one third with `"2 drive-relative"`.
  - **A manifest refusal names the path it refused over, and the same rule reaches the
    manifest a release after it reached the key.** `BuildManifest` returns
    `ManifestFailure` — a `ManifestFault` and the offending path — and every refusal
    inside it fills in both. The reasoning is `PathDisposition`'s exactly, arriving late
    only because the manifest side looked less silent than it was: a refusal here costs a
    translation unit direct mode **permanently** while the compile succeeds, the object
    still caches under the ordinary preprocessed key, and nothing else in the log mentions
    it — so "why does this TU never cache" is a whole investigation and the answer is one
    path (issue #68). Three things that are each load-bearing:
    - **The commonest refusal was not `BuildManifest`'s at all.** `RecordManifest` asks
      `CanonicalSourceToken` first and returned in **complete** silence when it declined,
      before `BuildManifest` ran — so a TU under neither root, which is an ordinary
      `add_subdirectory(../shared shared)` layout, produced no line even under
      `PACE_VERBOSE`. Giving `BuildManifest`'s error a path while leaving that guard
      alone would have fixed the case an operator almost never reaches. Issue #57 closed
      pointing straight at it.
    - **Five faults, not the two the refusal paths happen to have.** `Unanchored` is a
      working directory, `OutsideRoots` is a layout, `ToolchainLike` is a TU nobody
      expected to compile from, `Uncanonical` is a root spelled almost
      right, `Unreadable` is a file — each names a different thing to go and repair, which
      is what a fingerprint is for. `ToolchainLike` exists because `ClassifyAgainstRoots`
      tests its markers before any root, so "toolchain" and "under no root" arrive as one
      answer -- the root question is asked again in that one branch, the same correction
      `PathDisposition::DriveRelative` makes. `Unreadable` in particular had been sharing
      `DirectError::Malformed` with "these bytes off the wire are corrupt", so the two
      printed identically; `DirectError` is now decode-only and the two vocabularies do not
      meet. The table is an `EnumTable` checked by `RowsInEnumeratorOrder`, the same
      declaration `DispositionTable` uses — this landed while the branch was in review and
      is the seventh table to reach it, which is the point of there being one (issue #112).
      `DescribeManifestFailure` lives in `DirectManifest.cpp` for the same reason
      `DescribeDropped` does — `main.cpp` is in no test target — and keeps its own bounds
      check anyway, because `Last` is the extent and so still indexes one past the end.
    - **`TryDirectMode`'s identical guard stays silent, deliberately.** It is the same
      derivation from the same inputs as the recording side, so it refuses exactly when
      `RecordManifest` does and for exactly the same reason: a note there prints every such
      fact twice per translation unit. And the whole diagnostic stays verbose-gated, which
      is the #66 reversal below holding rather than being re-litigated — the issue asked for
      it ungated, and a source outside both roots is still an ordinary layout rather than a
      fault. What changed is that the gate now has something worth reading behind it.
  - **The reconciliation translates the emitted paths INTO the build's spelling; it does
    not respell the roots (issue #66).** There are two spellings of every root and the
    launcher needs both, for opposite reasons. **Matching** must use the spelling the
    filesystem reports, because that is what a driver reports. **Emitting** must use the
    spelling the build system uses, because a replayed depfile's rule target has to be
    byte-identical to the `-o` path the build passed. Resolving the roots and using that
    form everywhere satisfies the first and breaks the second — measured: a build tree
    reached through a symlink stored `.../link/build/a.o:` and replayed
    `.../real/build/a.o:`, which Ninja rejects outright (`expected depfile ... to mention
    ...`) while make matches no rule at all and silently drops every header dependency.
    `RootReconciler` (`apps/pace-cc/RootReconciler.cpp`) holds both layouts and is the only
    thing that sees the resolved one: it canonicalizes an emitted path against the
    resolved roots and localizes the token into the as-given roots. Everything downstream
    — the roots on the wire, the key, the manifest, the replay guard, the localized
    regions — keeps speaking the build system's own spelling exactly as before, so no
    protocol version moves and nothing else had to learn about this. Consequences that
    are each load-bearing:
    - **It is its own translation unit, for the reason `CacheProtocol.cpp` already
      records.** `main.cpp` is in no test target, so logic that lives there has no unit
      coverage at all — the mistake this list notes having been made once with the wire
      framing. `RootReconciler.cpp` is compiled into both the launcher and
      `pace-cc-tests`, and its tests drive it through a table-backed fake
      `IPathResolver`: the conditions it exists for (an 8.3 short component, a `subst`
      drive, a junction) cannot be created on the host running the tests, and two of the
      three cannot be created on any host that is not Windows, so a fake stating the
      aliasing directly is what makes every case reproducible everywhere.
    - **The translation is PathCanon's own two operations, not a third prefix test.**
      `Canonicalize` against one layout, `Localize` into the other. A rule written out
      again here is a rule that can come to disagree with the one everything else
      applies, which is the whole failure mode this entry documents.
    - **Only paths the COMPILER authored are reconciled; one the BUILD SYSTEM authored is
      already the spelling this build wants, and it is named BY VALUE.** A depfile is the
      single grammar carrying both, so `Cc::RootReconciler::Region` takes the object path and
      returns that span verbatim wherever it appears. Respelling it hands the build system
      back an output it never asked for, and a build whose `-o` does not share a spelling
      with `PACE_BINARY_DIR` then gets a depfile Ninja rejects outright and make
      matches against no rule at all. **By value and not by position**, because position
      does not say what a path is: `-MP` emits a phony rule per header whose TARGET is a
      path the compiler reported, and exempting every target would leave those unreconciled
      and so uncanonicalized, sending a consumer a depfile that points `-MP`'s
      deleted-header protection at files it cannot stat. Canonicalization on the daemon
      still rewrites every span, target included — a consumer needs the target pointing
      into ITS build tree.
    - **Symmetry is the property, and it is why this is a seam rather than a call at
      each comparison.** Expanding only the emitted paths breaks clang-cl exactly as
      spelling only the root long breaks `cl`. `Cc::IPathResolver`
      (`apps/pace-cc/PathResolve.hpp`) is where the filesystem lives, and it lives
      in the launcher because `PathCanon` also runs on the **daemon**, over a producing
      machine's roots that do not exist there (`CompileCacheHandler::HandleStore`), so it
      may never touch a filesystem. Hence `PathCanon::RewritePaths` taking the transform
      as a parameter: the grammar that finds path spans stays in the library.
    - **A path already spelled the way this build spells things is returned UNTOUCHED, and
      that is the correctness case rather than an optimization.** Resolution rewrites a
      symlink anywhere in a path, not only in the root prefix, so round-tripping an
      in-tree one (`src/inc -> src/real-inc`) would key it under this machine's real
      subpath while a machine holding the same content without that symlink keys under the
      plain one. Two byte-identical checkouts would stop sharing every entry — the property
      the launcher exists to provide, traded away to repair a spelling that was never wrong
      here. So `Translate` asks the as-given layout FIRST and only falls through to the
      resolved round trip when that fails. Measured: two such checkouts key identically,
      and at the same key a launcher built before this change produces.
    - **That fast path is also why it costs nothing, and the memo is what bounds the rest.**
      The resolver memoizes per parent DIRECTORY. Measured on this repository's own
      `CompileCacheHandler.cpp`: 1099 reported paths, 60 filesystem calls (all of them
      toolchain headers, which lie under no root by either spelling), and 271-276 ms per
      cache hit against 271-276 ms before — inside the noise. Per-path resolution with
      neither fast path nor memo is the version the issue worried about: roughly 1099 calls,
      ~25 ms, which on a 45 ms preprocess is not a rounding error.
    - **`Resolve` leaves the leaf as spelled, so an argument naming a directory must use
      `ResolveDirectory`.** The memo works per parent, so the final component of whatever
      is handed to `Resolve` is never resolved — fine for an include note (the name comes
      from an `#include` directive and is already long) and wrong for an `-I` pointing at
      a symlinked include directory, whose *own* last component is the aliased one. The
      argument list and the translation unit therefore go through `ResolveDirectory`,
      which also makes an `-I` resolve the same way the headers reported from under it
      do; there are few enough arguments that resolving each completely costs nothing.
    - **A relative path is returned verbatim.** It resolves against the compile's working
      directory and is therefore already machine-independent; absolutizing it would either
      re-key it for nothing or, when the working directory lies under neither root, push it
      outside both and have `KeyDependencySet` drop it. `RootReconciler::IsInTree` has to
      agree, and it asks its question of the RECONCILED path against the AS-GIVEN layout —
      the same two values that decide whether the path reaches the key. Asking the resolved
      layout instead answers a question nothing else asks, and a compile could then key
      nothing while the diagnostic reported it in-tree.
    - **A trailing separator is trimmed off each root, and leaving it is worse than a
      no-op.** `PathCanon::Layout` takes roots without one — `IsSegmentPrefix` requires a
      separator AFTER the root, so `/x/build/` matches nothing under `/x/build` — and a
      build system exporting one is doing nothing wrong. Untrimmed, nothing under that root
      canonicalizes (so the stored value keeps this machine's absolute paths) AND the path
      then gets a second chance through the resolved root, which `weakly_canonical` returns
      without the separator, after which `JoinLocalized` adds one of its own and the
      replayed rule target reads `/x/build//a.o`. A bare root (`/`, `C:\`) is left alone:
      it IS its trailing separator, and trimming `C:\` to `C:` would also flip the
      separator style `JoinLocalized` derives from it.
    - **The "never throws" contract is guarded at the entry points, not around the
      filesystem calls.** Every `std::filesystem` call here takes an `error_code`, so
      guarding only those looks sufficient — but on Windows `std::filesystem::path`
      *stores* a `wstring`, so constructing one from a narrow string converts through the
      active code page and `path::string()` converts back, either of which throws on a
      character the code page cannot represent. Those conversions happen before any step
      runs. `main()` has no catch of its own, so an escape breaks the build over a path
      the launcher merely failed to tidy up.
    - **No schema tag moved, and the reconciliation is why it did not have to.** Because it
      is identity wherever the spellings already agreed, `objkey-v3`/`manifest-v3` and
      `CompileValueVersion` all stay: verified, a launcher built from the previous commit
      stores entries this one HITs, and a manifest it recorded still direct-hits. Where the
      spellings did NOT agree the cache was not working, so there is nothing to invalidate.
    - **The diagnostic is verbose-gated, which reverses the original call.** It started
      ungated, on the reasoning that this defect is invisible and a diagnostic nobody
      enables is as silent as none. Two rounds of narrowing failed to find a condition
      that means "broken" reliably enough to justify four unsilenceable lines on the
      compiler's stderr for every translation unit: a source outside both roots is an
      ordinary CMake layout (`add_subdirectory(../shared shared)`, a superbuild,
      ExternalProject), and a message that cries wolf on a healthy build is the one that
      gets ignored when it is right. What tipped it is that `RootReconciler` now REPAIRS
      the mismatch rather than merely detecting it, so this is a backstop and not the
      mechanism.
      **The condition stayed narrow even so**, and reports the roots not containing the
      SOURCE rather than "nothing was keyed", because the broader one has an innocent
      reading: `/showIncludes` never names the primary source, so on MSVC a translation
      unit including only third-party headers outside the roots — Qt, a vendored SDK,
      anything the four-entry `ToolchainMarkers` table does not know about — reports paths
      and keys none of them while being perfectly healthy. `0 of 0` stays quiet too: that
      is a driver reporting nothing on the preprocess line, a different fault this message
      would misdescribe.
    - **The e2e cases create the second spelling deliberately** rather than relying on one:
      `compile-cache-e2e.sh` symlinks a root, `run-launcher-e2e.ps1` substitutes a drive
      (`subst`, not an 8.3 name — 8.3 creation is off on many volumes). Both compile one
      tree through both spellings and require the second to HIT the first's entry.
      **Which paths get which spelling is the whole design of the POSIX case**, and getting
      it wrong makes the case vacuous: the roots and the OUTPUT paths are the aliased
      spelling while the source and include paths are the real one, which is what `cl`
      actually does — a build system spells everything one way and the compiler reports its
      dependencies resolved the other way. Spelling the outputs the same way as the roots is
      what a real build does (`-o` and `PACE_BINARY_DIR` come from one generator) and
      it is what makes the second property testable at all: the replayed depfile's rule
      target must be byte-identical to the one the compiler wrote. A third leg repeats it
      with roots carrying a trailing separator. Both assertions were verified by
      reintroducing the bug they catch and watching them fail, and the whole case is checked
      against a launcher built from the previous commit, where it must fail with
      `dependency set: 0 of 2`. The Windows case names its object by the real path in both
      legs. That was load-bearing when it was written, because a fused `/Fo<path>` reached
      the key verbatim and would have keyed the legs apart for an unrelated reason; the
      bullet below has since made every path-valued flag relativize in its fused spelling
      too, so the precaution is now belt-and-braces rather than the thing holding the case
      up. Every other case keeps its roots unambiguous,
      so a regression in the reconciliation cannot present as a failure of something else.
- **A dependency cache outside the checkout is a ROOT of its own** (`<DEPROOT>`,
  `PathCanon::Layout::dependencyRoot`, `PACE_DEPS_DIR`, which the module sets from
  `CPM_SOURCE_CACHE`). CPM files each dependency under the commit it pinned, so the bytes are
  machine-independent while the location (`~/.cache/...`) is per user. Measured on this repo,
  two Docker machines with different homes: 10 of 1155 hits; the same two with the cache at
  ONE path: 794. Under no root, every include directory into it reached the key verbatim.
  - **The launcher tokenizes it in a value's text regions ITSELF, before the STORE**, with a
    layout naming only that root. A server canonicalizes with the two roots its frame
    carries and knows no third, so its behaviour cannot move and `CompileValueVersion` did
    not; it leaves a `<DEPROOT>` span alone. Left absolute, the other machine's replayed
    depfile names headers that are not there and the hit is refused as STALE, so a shared key
    would buy nothing.
  - **It relates as a root does**: its headers are content to the classifier, keyed in the
    dependency set and revalidated by direct mode, and an object naming it is bound
    (`CheckoutPart::DependencyRoot`, marker name `dependency-root`).
  - **Its debug records are NOT mapped**, and that is a gap rather than a design: a dispatched
    compile carries one directory-and-replacement pair, so a third debug rule would make a
    local and a dispatched object differ in their debug records under one key. A Debug
    build's object compiled from a dependency source therefore names the producing
    machine's cache in DWARF; code is unaffected and release builds carry none.
## Relativizing a path-valued flag

<!-- agent-tripwire: `/` introduces an option only on a Windows layout; on POSIX it starts a path -->

- **A flag's value is relativized off one table, or it is relativized in one spelling
  only.** A path-valued flag can be written two ways — `/Fo <path>` and `/Fo<path>` —
  and the separated form needs no table at all: the value is a bare argument, so it
  reaches the source-path branch on its own. Only the *fused* form has to be split, and
  the table that split it listed the include-dir prefixes and nothing else. So the object
  output was relativized in the spelling nobody uses and left absolute in the spelling
  **every** build system driving MSVC writes, which put the producing machine's object
  path into every Windows key: two checkouts at different roots could never share an
  entry, and the launcher's whole reason for existing was off on that platform. It passed
  unnoticed because the unit test asserting `/`-still-introduces-an-option happened to use
  the separated form, and because the Windows cross-depth e2e case was hitting an entry an
  earlier case had stored from the same directory with the same `/Fo` path — a spurious
  pass that would have survived cross-depth sharing being broken outright (fixed by giving
  each case its own string literal, the device `check_header_move` already used). The three
  tables are now one, `CmdLine`'s `PathValueFlags()`: it answers whether a bare occurrence
  consumes the next argument, which flag names the object output, which flags the preprocess
  line must drop, and whose fused value the key relativizes. Consequences that are each
  load-bearing: a row carries a **driver family**, because the family is *not* derivable
  from the introducer — MSVC drivers accept `-` for every option, and `-MT` names a
  dependency target for a GNU driver while selecting the static multithreaded runtime for
  an MSVC one, so a row matched on `-` alone would make `cl -MT` swallow the source file.
  Which *introducers* may match is still decided by the **layout**, not the host and not
  the driver, for the reason recorded above: on POSIX a leading `/` starts an absolute
  path, and matching `/I` there splits a checkout rooted at `/Infra`. And the drop list no
  longer spells `/Fo` or `-MF` itself — it drops every row whose role does not decide
  which headers the text is made of (`IncludeDir`, `ForcedInclude` and
  `PrecompiledHeaderInput` stay; `DroppedFromPreprocess`), so a spelling added to the
  table is dropped by construction rather than by someone remembering the fourth place.
  - **This did not bump `objkey-*` / `manifest-*`, and that is the deliberate half.**
    (The tags now read `v4`, moved by issue #64's manifest half — a different change, for
    a reason this one does not reach; the re-key here rides along in that invalidation
    event rather than costing a second. The reasoning below is kept because it is the case
    for *not* bumping, and it stands on its own.)
    The tag versions the key *construction* and the rules the stored value is written
    under; both are unmoved by this change, and `ComputeKey`'s golden vector did not move
    for it either. What changed is one *input*, for exactly the builds whose command line
    carried a machine-specific string it should never have carried. Old entries stay
    correct in their own terms and simply stop being addressed — they miss and are
    rewritten. The mis-serve a tag exists
    to prevent is unreachable here: an old key could only become a new key if a build
    literally passed the text `<BUILDTREE>`, and a `/Fo` path that was already relative
    canonicalizes to itself and does not move at all. A bump would meanwhile invalidate
    every POSIX entry, where nothing changed. Direct mode needs no bump either, and not by
    luck: `ComputeManifestKey` takes the relativized args too, so a manifest key moves
    exactly where an object key does, in lock-step, for exactly the affected builds — the
    property whose *absence* is what forced the `manifest-v2`/`v3` bumps, and whose
    presence is why `manifest-v4` had to be argued from the manifest side rather than
    from this one.
  - **The same argument covers #1661's and #1666's rows**, and is why they bumped nothing:
    `-isystem`, `-iquote`, `-idirafter`, `-isystem-after`, `-include`, `/FI`, `-FI` and
    `-include-pch` are table rows now, so a FUSED value (`-isystem/abs/dir`) is relativized
    where it used to be hashed literally. That re-keys exactly the builds that fused an
    absolute path into one of them — an input moving, never the construction — and their
    manifest keys move in the same lock-step.
## The digest

<!-- agent-tripwire: untriaged: #1567 the object key digest rule (MurmurHash3 x64_128, length-prefixed pieces, bit-identical everywhere) has no AGENT.md bullet -->

- **A key that is 128 bits wide is not a key with 128 bits of strength, and four
  lanes of one polynomial are one lane.** The object key was four CRC32C digests of
  the same blob, distinguished only by a leading salt byte. CRC is affine over
  GF(2), so with `A` the per-byte state-update operator and `S_i` the state after
  salt `i`, `quarter_i XOR quarter_j` is `A^len(blob) * (S_i XOR S_j)` — a value
  that depends on the blob's *length* and on nothing else about it. Matching one
  quarter therefore forced all four and the key carried **32 bits**. Measured
  before the fix: one distinct XOR value across 2000 random equal-length 512-byte
  blobs, and a full 32-hex-char collision after 86,125 equal-length inputs — the
  birthday bound for 32 bits, against the ~10^5 entries a shared team cache
  reaches. Equal length is not an exotic condition, it is the ordinary shape of a
  source edit (`return 1;` → `return 2;`) and the blob is dominated by preprocessed
  text; and the consequence is not a miss but an unrelated translation unit's object
  file served under a **zero exit code**. Two dead ends worth not re-walking:
  varying the salt *length* per lane does not help (still one distinct XOR value —
  the salt only changes `S_i`), and four CRC lanes with *distinct* polynomials do
  work but cap out below 128: three of the four best-studied CRC-32 polynomials
  (Castagnoli, Koopman, Koopman-K/2) carry the factor `(x+1)` and only IEEE 802.3
  does not, so the least common multiple of the four has degree 126, not 128. The
  digest is now MurmurHash3 x64_128 in `Core/MurmurHash3.hpp` — an existing,
  published algorithm rather than a bespoke construction, which is the whole point: its conformance is checkable
  against SMHasher's verification value `0x6384BA69`, and a construction assembled
  here would have nothing to be checked against. Consequences that are each
  load-bearing: `objkey-v3` and `manifest-v3` moved together (to v3) because that was one
  invalidation event, and `HashFileContents` moved with them — it paired one CRC32C
  with the byte count, which is 32 bits against exactly the same-length case, and it
  is what a *direct hit* revalidates against, so a collision there does not miss, it
  decides an edited header is unchanged. `header-state-v1` deliberately did **not**
  move, because nothing is stored under it and a version with no work to do is the
  mistake `PathCanon::CanonError` *was* — an error type no code path could produce,
  deleted by issues #59/#69 along with the wire status `0x06` it fed. Domain separation between the
  three key spaces is now the leading schema tag rather than the salts, and each piece
  of a key is **length-prefixed** (`kind`, big-endian `u64` length, bytes) rather than
  terminated by a separator byte. That second half is not cosmetic, and it was found
  in review of this very change: terminating a value with a byte that can occur
  *inside* a value is not a framing at all, so `{compilerId="cc\0d", preprocessed="x"}`
  and `{compilerId="cc", preprocessed="d\0x"}` digested identically — the same silent
  cross-TU mis-serve, reached by a different route, and reachable rather than
  theoretical because preprocessed text can carry a raw NUL and a build system can
  pass an argument containing `0x01`. Fixed here rather than filed for the reason
  `HashFileContents` was: `v3` re-keys the whole cache once, so finding it later would
  have cost a `v4` invalidation for a defect of the class this change exists to close.
  The length must be big-endian for the same reason the digest's block loads must be
  little-endian — a *host*-order length makes the key differ between machines.
  The residual, recorded deliberately: MurmurHash3 is not collision-resistant against
  an **adversary**, and that is accepted because the key is not a security boundary —
  anyone who can STORE can already write a wrong object under a correct key. Closing
  it would mean a keyed or cryptographic hash *and* a trust model for STORE, which is
  a different change from this one.
  - **The digest must be bit-identical on every machine that shares the cache, and
    the `x64` in its name is a variant, not a target.** MurmurHash3 defines `x86_128`
    (four 32-bit lanes) and `x64_128` (two 64-bit lanes); they produce *different*
    digests, so the variant is part of the format. Nothing in the implementation is
    architecture-specific, and four hazards that would have made it so are closed by
    construction: `char` is signed on x86-64 Linux and **unsigned on aarch64**, so a
    byte widened through a plain `char` sign-extends differently and would have split
    Apple Silicon from everything else — everything is `std::byte`/`std::uint8_t`;
    block loads go through `ReadLittleEndian` rather than a native-order read; that
    same read would be unaligned and therefore UB whatever the hardware tolerates,
    which is also what `-fsanitize=alignment` traps under `clang-debug`; and rotation
    uses `std::rotl` rather than a shift pair that is UB at zero. A divergence here
    would not fail, it would silently split the cache in two with every machine
    missing on every entry the others wrote — so the SMHasher vector is checked on
    the arm64 `macos-14` job as well as x86-64 Linux and Windows, and it sweeps all
    256 tail lengths, which is where such a slip surfaces first.

## Store caps, and a refusal the client can read

<!-- agent-tripwire: SIGPIPE is suppressed per socket, never process-wide: an ignored disposition is inherited across exec -->

- **A cache that can fail a build is not optional, and a refusal nobody can read
  is not a refusal.** The launcher STOREs an object by streaming one frame, and the
  daemon refused an over-cap frame by replying and then closing — while the sender
  was still writing. Two independent defects met there. Nothing in `pace-cc`
  suppressed SIGPIPE (the daemon does, in `Net/BlockingSocket`, but the launcher
  deliberately does not link the library), so the write that met the closed peer
  **killed the launcher with signal 13**; the build system saw a compile die of a
  signal even though the object file it asked for was already complete and correct
  on disk, and no retry could ever converge because the outcome was deterministic.
  Measured on a 356 MB object (C++23 templates plus `-g`) against the 256 MiB
  default cap, and reproduced here at 80 MB against the 64 MiB floor
  `SessionContext` keeps regardless of `--storage-max-value`. The launcher had
  correct fall-back logic for every store failure and reached none of it: a signal
  is not a return value. Three consequences, each load-bearing and each at a
  different layer, because any one alone leaves a hole the others do not cover:
  - **Suppression is per socket, not process-wide.** `SO_NOSIGPIPE` on macOS/BSD,
    `MSG_NOSIGNAL` on Linux, with `::signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)` only as a last
    resort for a platform with neither. The daemon can take the process-wide
    ignore; the launcher cannot, because an ignored disposition is **inherited
    across exec** and the launcher spawns the preprocessor and the real compiler —
    a process-wide ignore here silently changes how every compiler it fronts
    behaves. On macOS the socket option is also preferred over the newer
    `MSG_NOSIGNAL` *even though the SDK declares it*: the macro comes from the SDK
    while `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` lets the binary run on an older kernel,
    and a flag the kernel does not know fails the send rather than the signal.
  - **The daemon drains an over-cap frame before refusing it**, exactly as it
    already does for an unknown opcode, so the sender's write completes and it
    can read the typed `payload-too-large` naming *both* numbers — the one message
    that tells an operator which way to move `--storage-max-value`. This is the
    "a rejection can be a reply instead of a close" rule two bullets up, applied to
    the one path that was still closing. `ByteReader::Skip` discards in chunks, so
    the memory the cap protects is still never taken. Bounded at a small multiple
    of the cap rather than by a knob of its own, because the cap is already the
    operator's statement of the largest thing this server will handle.
  - **The launcher declines the store before connecting**, at
    `PACE_MAX_STORE_BYTES` (256 MiB by default, `0` disables). Surviving the
    refusal is not enough: without a ceiling every rebuild of that translation
    unit pays the full transfer to be told no, and one 356 MB entry would dominate
    a cache sized for thousands of ordinary objects. The default matching the
    daemon's `--storage-max-value` default is a *chosen coincidence*, not a
    negotiation — there is deliberately no handshake, so raising one and not the
    other leaves the other refusing.

  The residual, recorded deliberately: the 64 MiB floor in `SessionContext` means
  a cap *below* it cannot be tested end-to-end without a genuinely large fixture,
  so the e2e drives the client ceiling and `TcpClient_test` pins the socket half
  (its `HangUpPeer` case terminated the test binary with signal 13 before the fix —
  verified by re-neutering it, since a regression test for a fatal signal that
  cannot be seen to fail is worth nothing).

## A path a compiler wrote is not this process's text

<!-- agent-tripwire: A path a COMPILER wrote is not this process's text -->

- **`RootReconciler::Path` is where a tool-emitted path becomes text, because it is
  the funnel every one of them already passes through** (`All` and `Region` both
  come here) and because nothing downstream can do it. The launcher's roots come
  from `argv`, which on a Windows host declaring the UTF-8 code page is UTF-8, while
  `cl.exe` writes `/showIncludes` in the CONSOLE OUTPUT code page — `C3 BC` for
  U+00FC under CP 65001, `81` under CP 850, measured. Untranslated, such a path
  prefix-matches no root, so a project header classifies as toolchain content:
  dropped from the key, stat'ed by nothing, and a header edited inside it serves the
  stored object under a zero exit code.

- **Two candidate encodings, in this order and no other**: UTF-8 if the bytes are
  UTF-8 (clang and gcc always, `cl` under a UTF-8 console), else the one code page
  the host names. Never a ladder — a single-byte page decodes nearly everything, and
  Windows even maps CP-1252's five unassigned bytes to the matching C1 controls, so
  trying pages until one "works" produces a path naming a file that does not exist
  rather than a refusal.

- **The DECODED form is what comes back, not merely what the decision is made on.**
  Returning the raw bytes for a path the reconciler translates no further was tried
  and is wrong twice: the key and the manifest prefix-match against roots that are
  UTF-8, and `Region`'s result goes into a value SHARED between machines which the
  daemon canonicalizes against those same roots. One encoding in a stored value is
  the rule #141 settled for the wire.

- **What cannot be read is counted, and the compile is not cached.** Same hazard as
  `PathDisposition::DriveRelative` and the same answer, asked in all three places
  the count can rise: the key path, the manifest record, and again after the stored
  regions are built — `Region` walks a wider set of path spans than the dependency
  list, so the earlier ask cannot have covered them. The refusal names the recovery
  (`chcp 65001`).

- **Whether bytes must be text at all is a property of the HOST**, carried as
  `NarrowTextPolicy` and injected rather than probed — so `PortableForm` stays pure
  and both hosts' behaviour is testable on either. On POSIX nothing is transcoded
  and a legacy filename is a perfectly good filename; refusing one there would break
  a build that works today.

- **A launcher never fails a build the compiler would have completed**, and
  `std::filesystem::path`'s narrow constructor throws on a UTF-8-code-page host for
  bytes that are not. Every construction from foreign text goes through
  `Platform::PathFromNarrowText`; `MissingReplayedDependency` is the one that
  matters most, because its bytes arrive over the NETWORK — there, unreadable counts
  as *missing*, which discards the hit and recompiles rather than serving one it
  could not check.

## A compiler's WORDS are localized too, and `VSLANG` may only touch the probe

<!-- agent-tripwire: Reading `/showIncludes` and WRITING it are different questions and must not be consolidated -->

- **`VSLANG=1033` goes on the probe spawn and never on the real compile.** The
  launcher matches `cl`'s `/showIncludes` notes against the literal English
  `IncludeNoteMarker`, so a Visual Studio carrying a language pack answered every
  reader of them in a language the launcher does not read: the cache key lost its
  dependency set and no manifest was ever recorded, on every translation unit,
  forever, behind a cache that still hits on preprocessed keys and therefore looks
  healthy ([#692](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/692)). The
  fix is to ask the compiler to speak English — but only where **the output is
  parsed and dropped**, which is `Preprocess`. The real compile's streams are read
  by a human, and forcing English there trades a silent performance loss for
  silently anglicizing every warning and error a developer sees. `IProcessRunner`
  therefore gets a separate entry point rather than a flag, so the distinction is
  made at the call site where it can be seen. The next person here will be tempted
  by the real compile; that is the whole reason this is written down.

- **The added environment is layered on the inherited one, never substituted for
  it.** A spawn that replaced it loses `INCLUDE`, and a compiler that cannot find
  `cstddef` reports a confident syntax error rather than a missing environment. A
  test for this must assert something a replacement cannot survive — a real `PATH`'s
  directory SEPARATOR, not its length: `cmd.exe` echoes an unset variable as the
  literal `%PATH%`, so a length check passes against a runner that dropped the whole
  inherited block, which is how the first version of that test certified the very
  bug it was written to catch.

- **`VSLANG` is best effort, so the residue is NAMED rather than reported as
  nothing.** `cl` ignores it when the requested language pack is not installed, so
  no caller may conclude from a successful spawn that the child obeyed — the check
  is on the OUTPUT. When the probe still extracts nothing,
  `CarriesUnreadableIncludeNotes` separates "this build asked for no dependencies"
  from "this machine's compiler answered in a language I do not read", because one
  empty set for both prints a sentence that is true about what the launcher observed
  and false about the world. That predicate feeds a MESSAGE and nothing else, which
  is exactly why it may be loose where `IncludeNotePath` may not: the recognition
  rule is shared with `SplitIncludeNotes`, which runs over a stream that also
  carries preprocessed SOURCE, so loosening THAT deletes a source line out of the
  bytes the key hashes. Its separator table carries the full-width colon `U+FF1A` as
  well as `": "`, because MSVC's CJK catalogues use it and a fixture typed by hand
  will not discover that on its own.

- **The reading side and the WRITING side are different questions, and consolidating
  them is the tempting wrong move.** `RenderShowIncludes` emitted the same English
  `IncludeNoteMarker` under a comment saying a second spelling is how a producer and
  its parser drift. That comment was right about the two parties it could see and
  blind to the third: Ninja does not match `IncludeNoteMarker`, it matches
  `msvc_deps_prefix`, which CMake took from the *actual* compiler. So a localized build
  recorded **no dependencies** for a dispatched compile and stopped rebuilding it — a
  wrong build under a zero exit code, reached through the build graph rather than the
  cache, which is the opposite direction from #692 and worse
  ([#700](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/700)). `VSLANG` cannot
  fix it: you cannot produce a localized prefix by forcing English, and forcing it on
  the real compile anglicizes every diagnostic a developer reads.
  - The marker is now a **required, undefaulted parameter** of `RenderShowIncludes`,
    fed from `PACE_MSVC_DEPS_PREFIX` at the one place the launcher reads its
    environment. That is *stronger* than the invariant it replaces: the producer spells
    no literal at all, so it cannot drift from its parser — there is nothing to drift
    with. A default argument would let the next call site omit the build's prefix and
    reintroduce this in silence, which is `ReportedDependencies`' deleted default
    constructor one file away.
  - **The ticket was recorded as blocked on a localized `cl` and was not.**
    `msvc_deps_prefix` is a string the BUILD holds, so both the defect and its repair
    are reachable with no language pack and no MSVC at all — ninja matches the literal
    string and knows nothing about languages.
    `scripts/probes/ninja-msvc-deps-prefix.sh` is the measurement and the only place
    its figures live, because it ASSERTS its own recorded table rather than printing
    one. Three cases, and the third is the load-bearing one: matching, mismatched, and
    **localized-matching**. Reproducing a defect proves it is real; only feeding the
    right prefix and watching the dependency come back proves the FIX is observable,
    and without that this ticket stalls again on "how would we know".
  - That asymmetry is why **discovery** was split out rather than chosen
    ([#878](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/878)): the escape
    hatch's input IS the prefix string, so a test supplies it, while discovery's input
    is the compiler's output language — on an English `cl` you discover English and
    prove nothing, and a stub asserts its own premise. Unexercisable here by
    construction, and an unexercisable fix for a defect whose character is silence is
    how this returns in a different costume.
  - **The launcher cannot detect the unset case, and must not pretend to.** Do not build
    a guard or a message on `probed.unreadable`: #821 was reverted for exactly that, and
    the claim underneath it — which stream `cl` writes its notes on — is now MEASURED
    (#825, the table above) and says that guard was worse than merely unproven: it read
    **stderr alone**, and a COMPILE puts the notes on stdout, so it could not fire for
    the case it was written for and would have fired only on a `/EP` run. #700's own floor is *discovered, never
    inferred from a failed parse*. What ships instead is a `PACE_VERBOSE` line on
    every dispatched compile that synthesises notes, naming the prefix and its
    provenance, because that is the one line answering *why did my build stop rebuilding
    this file*.
  - The **stored-region** half is untouched and is
    [#879](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/879), not a residual:
    `Grammar::ShowIncludes` taking a run-time prefix would make two nodes canonicalize
    one value differently under one `CompileValueVersion`, which is a fleet-wide
    generation bump plus a corpus row and must not hide inside a build-correctness fix.

## The build system reads what we EMIT, and it refuses a path by LENGTH before it canonicalizes

<!-- agent-tripwire: Ninja refuses a `/showIncludes` path longer than `_MAX_PATH` BEFORE it canonicalizes -->

- **The limit is a fixed stack buffer in Ninja, not a filesystem rule, and nothing a
  host is configured with reaches it.** `IncludesNormalize::Normalize()`
  (`src/includes_normalize-win32.cc`) declares `char copy[_MAX_PATH + 1]`, compares
  `input.size()` against `_MAX_PATH`, and fails with `path too long` — all before the
  `GetFullPathNameA` that would have collapsed the path. No syscall happens, so
  `LongPathsEnabled` cannot help, and Ninja already ships a `longPathAware` manifest,
  so an operator who enables long paths has correctly configured something that was
  never in the way. The build stops with **no compiler diagnostic at all**, which
  reads as a toolchain fault rather than a path one.

- **A driver's note path is a concatenation, not a resolved path.** MSVC and clang-cl
  resolve a quoted `#include` against the TEXTUAL path of the including file and echo
  the result verbatim, so a chain of nested relative includes ACCUMULATES `../..`
  segments and grows without bound in the depth of the chain. Measured on the report
  that prompted this, under Windows 11, VS 18, MSVC 14.51.36231, clang-cl, the
  VS-bundled Ninja and a 60-byte build root: a **299-byte** note path collapsing to
  **88**, with 28 translation units over the limit in one module. Object paths were
  not the cause and are not the fix — the longest of those was 201, so
  `CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX` is inert against this.

- **Collapsing first is safe because Ninja does the same collapse one statement
  later.** `Cc::CollapseNotePaths` is purely lexical and preserves everything it
  cannot improve: a path with no `..` SEGMENT comes back byte-identical (`a..b` is not
  one), and a path still carrying `..` afterwards comes back as the input rather than
  as a re-separated spelling that gained nothing.

- **The ingest side followed with value generation 6, which is what it was waiting
  for** ([#1593](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1593)). Collapsing
  on the way IN changes what a stored region looks like, so it was held back until a
  `CompileValueVersion` bump came along to pay for it once, as #879 and #891 were
  batched. It is two places, each doing it once. The probe's dependency list crosses
  `RootReconciler::DependencyList`, which reconciles, collapses and -- on a Windows
  layout -- spells every path with `\`, so the key's neighbours, the manifest and a
  dispatched compile's depfile and notes read one spelling per header. The separator is
  part of that and was MEASURED: `cl` (VS 18) reports one header as `<root>\a/x.h`
  directly and as `<root>\b\../a/x.h` through a second header, so a collapse alone
  leaves two byte strings. The stored regions are collapsed by the SERVER:
  `PathCanon::CanonicalizeRegion` collapses EVERY span before matching the roots, so a
  span under a root becomes its token and one that lands under none is stored as its
  collapsed absolute spelling -- never `<BUILDTREE>/../..`, a token resolving against the
  CONSUMER's root depth, which names a different file there (Job 2 review, I1). Every
  server still canonicalizes identically by construction. The collapse holds a drive and
  a whole UNC share (`\\host\share`) aside as the anchor, so neither is ascended past. There is ONE lexical collapse,
  `PathCanon::CollapseRelativeSegments`, shared by the emit side and both ingest places;
  `LexicalForm` stays apart as the key-path helper whose output is hashed.
- **A guarded header reached twice is ONE note from the driver; an unguarded one is
  two.** Measured on both drivers under `/c` and `/EP`: the multiple-include optimization
  skips the second note entirely, so a fixture for the two-spelling case needs a header
  that is read again.

- **The seam is the four emit sites, never `ReplayStreams`.** That function is a
  byte-exact I/O primitive and holds neither the grammar nor the marker, and the hit
  path has to collapse per region on that region's own grammar. The grammar comes
  from `Cc::StreamGrammar(cmd.flavor)` for the reason #825 already gives — the channel
  follows the FLAG, not the driver — and only a grammar that `CarriesIncludeNotes` is
  gated in, because Ninja's depfile reader carries no length check. Only the NOTES are
  rewritten even then, under `Grammar::MsvcStream` too: a diagnostic is printed rather
  than parsed, so its spelling stays the compiler's.

- **On the hit path the collapse sits between localization and the marker restore, and
  both ends pin it there.** A `<SRCROOT>` token is not a path, so there is nothing to
  collapse until localization has run; and the collapse finds notes by the canonical
  marker, which the bytes carry only until the restore re-spells them. The restore is
  still the last step, and the comment saying so has to account for all three.

- **A path over the limit with no `..` to collapse is still refused**, and no lexical
  rule can change that. The remedy there is a shorter build root, and it belongs in
  the tool's `## Known limitations` rather than in a fix.

## An object file is not a byte string, and `PACE_VERIFY` is where that bites

<!-- agent-tripwire: An object file is not a byte string. Every MSVC driver stamps the clock into the COFF `TimeDateStamp` -->

`PACE_VERIFY` compiles a sampled hit again and compares the two objects. It
compared them with `memcmp`, and on Windows that **can never succeed**: every
MSVC-family driver stamps the wall clock into the COFF header, and a cached object
was produced earlier than the fresh compile it is checked against *by construction*.
So the one instrument that turns a wrong object from invisible into loud reported a
wrong object on **every** hit, on the platform where
[#368](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/368) — a wrong object
served under a correct key — was actually observed
([#493](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/493)).

The fact was already written down three times, in
[`distributed-compilation.md`](distributed-compilation.md), in
`scripts/dist-compile-e2e.ps1` and in `docs/tools/pace-node.md` — and
none of those is a file anyone editing `HitVerification.cpp` opens. **That is why it
is repeated here**, in the launcher's own rule file, rather than linked.

What was measured, on this tree, rather than reasoned from "ELF is reproducible":

<!-- table-total: none -->
| two compiles of one TU differing in | `cl` 14.51 | `clang-cl` | clang 20.1 / GCC 14.2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| nothing — same object path, 2 s and 300 s apart | the 4-byte `TimeDateStamp`, and **nothing else** | the same | **identical**, with and without `-g` |
| the object's directory | + `.debug$S`, `.chks64` | nothing more | identical |
| the source's directory | + `.debug$S`, `.chks64` | nothing more | identical |

Five rules follow, and the second is the one an obvious fix gets wrong:

- **ELF keeps the byte comparison.** This is a platform gap, not a total failure.
  Normalising a field there would overlook a real difference to fix a problem that
  platform does not have.
- **`.debug$S` and `.chks64` are volatile with respect to the PATH, not to time —
  so they are NOT excused.** The verifier copies the served object aside and
  compiles to the *same* output path, so a hit this machine produced differs in the
  clock alone and there is nothing to overlook. Excusing them anyway would buy
  nothing and would go silent on
  [#489](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/489): a hit served
  from another checkout, whose entire difference lives in `.debug$S`. That is the
  case an operator turns verification on to catch, and excusing it is #493 cured by
  no longer looking — which passes every test written for #493 itself.
- **Parsing never grants an excuse.** The one normalised region is a single header
  field whose offset is read from a two-row layout table (`/bigobj` is an allowed
  argument, so such a build is cacheable and its clock is at offset 8). The section
  walk exists only to say WHERE a difference was, so a parser defect can make a
  message vague and cannot make a wrong object pass.
- **Which image is unreadable decides the answer, and it is asymmetric.** A FRESH
  object this build cannot lay out is this build's blind spot — `HitVerdict::Unsupported`,
  refusing by name, because an operator who reads "cannot verify" as "your cache is
  broken" switches the instrument off and the guarded class goes invisible again. A
  SERVED object that will not parse while the fresh one does is `Mismatched`: that is
  a truncated transfer, and a real finding.
- **Not `/Brepro`**, for the reason `dist-compile-e2e.ps1` already gives about
  itself: it would make the comparison true about a command line no build uses.

And the acceptance shape, because a verifier is the one component whose *failure to
fire* is invisible: a correct hit verifying clean proves nothing on its own — a
verifier that stops crying wolf by no longer looking passes that perfectly. Every
change here also shows a deliberately corrupted object still answering `Mismatched`,
and an object from another checkout still answering `Mismatched`, on **real compiler
output** rather than only on synthetic bytes.

## A compiler records WHERE it was built, and the key cannot see that

<!-- agent-tripwire: A compiler with debug info on records the WORKING DIRECTORY, which is on no command line -->

The key is portable across checkouts by design — that is what the launcher is
for. A compiler with debug info on is not: it writes the compile's working
directory into the object, and the working directory appears on no command line,
so no amount of relativizing reaches it. A hit therefore replays an object naming
the producing checkout, a debugger looks for sources in a tree this machine does
not have, and nothing fails. Issue #203; issue #489 is the same defect
approached from the key end.

**Measured, one TU byte-identical in two roots differing only in name and by the
same character count, against a same-root baseline of 0 differing bytes:**

<!-- table-total: none -->
| driver | debug info off | debug info on | remedy the driver offers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `g++` (ELF) | identical | **differs, 143 B** — `DW_AT_comp_dir` | `-fdebug-prefix-map` → identical |
| `clang++` (ELF) | identical | **differs, 6 B** | `-fdebug-prefix-map` → identical |
| `clang-cl` (COFF) | identical | **differs, 23 B** | `-ffile-prefix-map` → **still 23 B** |
| `cl` (COFF) | **differs, 11 B** | **differs, 28–31 B** | none exists |

The baseline is not a formality. Write each compile to a *different* `/Fo` name
and every command line differs, `/Z7` embeds the command line, and the baseline
stops being one — the same confound that cost #493 a re-run.

- **A build that fixes the directory itself, `-fdebug-compilation-dir=.`, is DISPATCHED with
  it (#1681)**, and that is the one remedy above that reaches clang-cl's `LF_BUILDINFO`: the
  value is recorded rather than opened, so it travels with `-fcoverage-compilation-dir=.` and
  `-gno-codeview-command-line`, each `.`-shaped or bare. Measured client against worker
  (clang 22.1.8, the conditions on the rows in `CompileJob.cpp`): it makes the COFF current
  directory and the ELF `DW_AT_comp_dir` `.` on BOTH ends where they differed, the other two
  only remove what differed, and none moves the worker's object further from the client's.
  The worker's own directory rules stay as they are: they match no `.`, so a client that also
  maps its build directory gets the same object with the flag as without.
- **It is not `/Z7`, and the launcher does not create the precondition.** `cl` with
  no debug flag at all already differs cross-root: `.debug$S` carries an
  `S_OBJNAME` record holding the resolved **absolute** object path, and `.chks64`
  a hash derived from it. `CompileCache.cmake`'s `/Zi`→`/Z7` rewrite widens 11
  bytes to 28; it does not open the hole, and turning debug info off does not
  close it.
- **A key-side fix cannot work by hardening argument handling.** With a fully
  relative command line — cwd at the checkout root, source and output both named
  relatively, so the two command lines are **byte-identical** — the objects still
  differ. What is embedded is the working directory and the path the driver
  resolves `/Fo` against. Neither is an argument. So #489's shape needs the
  compile *location* as a key input in its own right, which costs cross-checkout
  sharing on every `cl` compile.
- **The divergence is debug and identity records only.** `.text`, `.data`,
  `.xdata`, `.pdata`, the relocations and the symbol table are byte-identical in
  every differing pair. A wrong *artefact* under a correct key, not wrong *code* —
  which is why neither ticket can be #368's mechanism.
- **`-fdebug-prefix-map`, never `-ffile-prefix-map`.** The wider flag implies
  `-fmacro-prefix-map` and rewrites `__FILE__` in the text the key hashes, which is
  the *Only the DEBUG spelling* bullet below. `__FILE__` is self-protecting **for
  `ComputeKey` and for nothing else**: the preprocessor expands it and `ComputeKey`
  hashes preprocessed output raw, so whenever the expansion is checkout-dependent it
  is checkout-dependent in THAT key's text too, and whenever that text agrees the
  expansion agrees. Measured through `/EP` alone — absolute source spelling differs,
  relative agrees, relative plus `/FC` differs. **It protects no other key.** The
  direct-mode manifest key never sees the expansion, and `std::source_location` is
  filled in by the compiler after preprocessing, so it reaches no key at all: two
  checkouts DID share a key while their program-visible file names differed, on the
  default path for `__FILE__` and on every path for `source_location`. This bullet
  used to say no such arrangement existed; the measurement it cited touched the one
  key where that is true. *An object that names its producer's roots is keyed apart*,
  below, is what closes both.
- **The flag names the producing checkout by construction, so the KEY has to
  relativize it.** Measured before the row existed: `RelativizeArgs` returned
  `-fdebug-prefix-map=/home/ci/checkout-aaa=/pace/src` byte-for-byte, so
  appending the flag alone would have produced correct objects and turned every
  cross-checkout hit into a **miss** — silently, since a miss is what a cold cache
  looks like too. `PathValueRole::PrefixMap` splits the value at the last `=`,
  the way GNU does, and relativizes only the head.
- **The replacement half is deliberately left literal.** Two machines mapping to
  different replacements write different objects, so they must compute different
  keys. That is what makes "the mapping must be identical on every machine sharing
  the cache" a property of the key rather than a line of advice — a disagreeing
  machine misses instead of mis-serving.
- **The rules are computed by one function and checked as a computation.**
  `_fc_debug_prefix_map_rules` in `cmake/portable/CompileCache.cmake`, driven by
  `ctest -R debug-prefix-map-rules` over a table of layouts. It was wrong twice
  before it was ever run, in ways invisible in the layout a developer has:
  `file(RELATIVE_PATH)` answers with a **trailing separator**, so the rewritten
  path read `../../..//src/tu.cpp` and stopped matching the spelling the build
  system passes for the same file; and for an out-of-tree build it answers
  `../../mnt/d/…/checkout` — *relative*, and carrying the entire root inside it,
  which would have replaced the checkout's path with the checkout's path and read
  as working. **Relative does not imply checkout-independent**; the test asserts
  that property separately from the expected values, because a table can be edited
  to agree with wrong code.
- **The build tree is mapped LAST, and no object comparison can check that.** GCC
  and Clang honour the **last** matching rule — measured off `DW_AT_comp_dir` on
  gcc 14 and clang 20, not inferred, after this rulebook and the code both said
  the opposite for three commits. Build-first leaves `comp_dir` as
  `../../../out/build/<name>`; source-first gives `.`. Both are
  checkout-independent, so two checkouts still produce byte-identical objects and
  every e2e reads green either way. What the wrong order costs is narrower and
  sharper: two machines whose build trees sit at the same depth under different
  NAMES (`out/build/gcc-release` against `out/build/ci-release`) relativize to one
  key — both flags tokenize to the same canonical text — while their objects
  differ. That is the #203 symptom reappearing inside the fix for it, and the only
  instrument that sees it is reading `comp_dir` directly.
- **The table KEYS all three spellings; the module ADDS the debug one always and
  `-fmacro-prefix-map` under `pace-cc` alone.**
  `-fmacro-prefix-map` and `-ffile-prefix-map` rewrite `__FILE__`, which lands in the
  preprocessed text the key hashes — measured on both drivers with the source named
  absolutely, where `-fdebug-prefix-map` leaves that text byte-identical and the other
  two do not. So they are a role of their own, `PathValueRole::SourcePrefixMap`, and
  the role differs from `PrefixMap` in exactly the two places where reaching the text
  matters:
  - **It STAYS on the preprocess line** (`DroppedFromPreprocess`), so the key hashes
    the `__FILE__` the real compile produces. Dropping it — what every role but
    `IncludeDir` gets — is the reason this bullet used to forbid a row at all.
  - **On a dispatched line the two spellings part** (`PathValueFlag::remote`, a COLUMN):
    a worker compiles text whose `#line` markers name the client's paths, so without the
    client's rule it would embed `source_location` names unmapped, under the key a mapped
    one uses. `-fmacro-prefix-map` is FORWARDED verbatim and the worker's allowlist admits
    it (`ArgValue::PrefixMapRule`: its halves are paths and it opens neither);
    `-ffile-prefix-map` is REFUSED by name, because it also rewrites debug records the
    worker maps by its own `-fdebug-prefix-map` rules.
  - **The module maps `__FILE__` for the checkout (`<src>/=`) and the dependency cache
    (`<cache>/=deps/`, LAST)** — `_fc_source_prefix_map_rules`, checked by
    `ctest -R debug-prefix-map-rules` — and only when `pace-cc` is the launcher, the
    one that keys the rule portably. Measured on this repo before it: every Catch2 test
    object (358 of 1017) named its checkout and was stored per checkout.
  - **And the build tree's PLACE under the source root is keyed** whenever one is
    present. `-ffile-prefix-map=<SRCROOT>/=` turns a generated header into
    `build/gen.hpp` in one checkout and `out/build/r/gen.hpp` in another; nothing else
    in the key records where the build tree sits (its paths tokenize as
    `<BUILDTREE>`), a `source_location` there reaches no key text, and the result is
    relative, so the root-binding scan cannot see it. A tree outside the source root
    is keyed as OUTSIDE, never by its path.
  - **What it cost while it was unrecognised**: it reached the key verbatim, absolute
    root included. Catch2's own CMake passes `-ffile-prefix-map=<checkout>/=` on every
    compile, so no two checkouts of Catch2 shared anything — measured 0 of 107 hits
    from a second folder, 107 of 107 with the rows, every served object byte-identical
    to that folder's own uncached compile. No `objkey`/`manifest` bump, by `v3`'s
    argument in `ComputeKey`: one input stopped carrying a machine-specific string.
- **A root with a SPACE is not mapped, and that is a refusal.** The rules are
  spliced into `CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`, which is space-separated, so a rule naming
  `/Users/john doe/proj` reaches the driver as two arguments and every compile
  dies with `invalid argument '/Users/john' to '-fdebug-prefix-map'` — measured.
  `check_compiler_flag` cannot catch it, because it probes a synthetic `/a=/b`.
- **The two drivers disagree about where `<from>=<to>` splits, and neither answer
  is right for both.** Measured with a directory named `a=b`: gcc cuts at the last
  separator, clang at the first. The launcher follows gcc. Reachable only when a
  mapped root itself contains a separator, and it costs a MISS rather than a
  mis-serve — the head the launcher isolates lies under no root either way.
- **A dispatched compile carries the DIRECTORY AND ITS REPLACEMENT, never the rule**
  ([#506](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/506)). A worker needs
  a rule whose left-hand side is a path on the WORKER, which the client has never
  seen — so `RemoteCompileArgs` dropping the flag is right and stays, and
  `CompileRequest::compileDir` plus `compileDirReplacement` travel instead. That makes
  the replacement a contract both ends share rather than a convention each machine
  picks, which is the decision this was open on.
  - **BOTH candidate directories are mapped, because WHICH one the object records is
    the DRIVER's answer.** gcc's `-fworking-directory` is implicit under `-g` and
    emits a line marker naming the preprocessing directory, which the worker's compile
    adopts; clang emits none. Measured on gcc 14.2.0 and clang 20.1.2, reading
    `DW_AT_comp_dir` off the worker's object: `g++ -E -g` records the CLIENT's
    directory, while `g++ -E` and `clang++ -E`/`-E -g` record the WORKER's. Mapping
    only the worker's own fixes clang and leaves gcc recording the client's UNMAPPED
    path — which no object comparison can see. The first implementation of this ticket
    did exactly that, passed every unit test, and was caught only by reading
    `comp_dir` end to end. Removing the mapping fails both drivers naming DIFFERENT
    directories, which is the asymmetry itself.
  - **A model of a driver that is MORE PERMISSIVE than the driver produces WRONG
    AGREEMENT, which is worse than the disagreement it replaces.** This is the general
    rule and the two below are its instances; both were arrived at independently while
    fixing the same ticket, which is why it is written as a pattern rather than as two
    fixes. A model that is too NARROW costs a miss — the mapping does not travel, the
    object keeps an absolute path, and the two ends disagree visibly. A model that is
    too WIDE tells a worker to apply a mapping the local compile did not, so both
    objects are confidently mapped, to different things, under one key. The asymmetry
    is the whole point: err narrow.
      - Matching the rule's root against the working directory by FILESYSTEM IDENTITY
        (canonicalize both, compare) rather than by the byte prefix the driver
        implements. Measured: `-fdebug-prefix-map=/tmp/l506f/build=.` against a cwd
        reached as `/tmp/l506f-link/build` leaves `DW_AT_comp_dir` UNMAPPED, so
        identity-matching would have mapped where the driver does not.
      - Deciding whether `PWD` is usable with `std::filesystem::path::is_absolute()`
        rather than a leading `/`. Same test on POSIX, strictly wider on a Windows
        layout, where it admits `D:/work` and `\\host\share` and NEITHER Windows
        driver consults `PWD` for either — libiberty's `getpwd()` gates on `*p == '/'`,
        and LLVM does the `PWD` dance only in `Unix/Path.inc`. A MinGW client would
        have predicted a spelling its own compiler never uses. Read, not measured: no
        Windows GNU-layout driver was available, and the table below is Linux.
  - **And that directory is `$PWD`, not `getcwd(3)`** — asked through
    `CompilerWorkingDirectory`, on both sides. Both drivers report `DW_AT_comp_dir`, and
    byte-compare every `<from>` against, the `PWD` variable when it is ABSOLUTE and names
    the SAME directory as `.`; `getcwd(3)` only when it is not. Measured, gcc 14 and
    clang 20 identical, cwd `/tmp/l506f/build` reached as `/tmp/l506f-link/build`: the
    link spelling is recorded verbatim, while unset, a different real directory, a
    nonexistent path and a relative path each fall back to `/tmp/l506f/build`. So it is a
    `stat` comparison, not a spelling one — `std::filesystem::equivalent`. And the
    discriminating case: a rule written with the RESOLVED spelling matches NOTHING, so
    this cannot be answered by canonicalizing both sides and comparing identities — the
    first instance of *err narrow* above. `current_path()` is `getcwd(3)`, so the first implementation matched nothing on any
    build reached through a link, sent no pair, and left the dispatched object unmapped —
    this ticket surviving its own fix, with every counter normal. macOS meets it because
    `/var` is a symlink and `$TMPDIR` is under one; Linux `/tmp` is not, which is why it
    reached master green. Case 13 therefore runs at TWO spellings, and each compiles its
    own source or the second is served the first's cached object and never dispatches.
  - **The residue identifies the DRIVER, not the origin.** A dispatched object recording
    the CLIENT's directory does not mean it came from no worker: that is gcc's
    `-fworking-directory` marker being adopted, measured with `DISPATCHED to` in the same
    log. clang leaves the WORKER's showing for the identical fault. So macOS and Linux
    print different directories for one defect, which is a SECOND reason mapping a single
    candidate could never have held — either one breaks it alone. What discriminates is
    the launcher's spelling against its resolved form, never which directory appeared.
  - **It is the node's WORKING directory, not its scratch directory** — the ticket
    said scratch and was wrong, so "map the scratch dir" fixes nothing.
    `CompileJobRunner::Run` spawns with absolute source and object paths and never
    chdirs, and `IProcessRunner` has no directory parameter, so the worker-side
    candidate is whatever directory the node service was started in.
  - **Empty means map nothing, and that is the whole argument against a worker-side
    constant.** A worker that mapped anyway would hand a build that asked for
    nothing an object naming a directory neither machine has — the same asymmetry,
    pointing the other way. It is a test, not a branch.
  - **It cannot ride in `args`.** `IsAcceptableJobArgument` refuses any argument
    body carrying a path separator, deliberately, and both halves are full of them.
    Weakening that rule to carry a debug token would be paying a security-shaped
    price for a debug-info fix.
  - **The DIRECTORY says whether a mapping is in force, never the replacement.** An
    empty replacement is legal — `-fdebug-prefix-map=<builddir>=` maps a root to
    nothing and is a standard reproducible-build spelling, and refusing it as "half a
    pair" cost such a build distribution entirely. A replacement with no directory is
    the one malformed half, and is refused: it would map everything.
  - **The worker's OWN rule is dropped when it would also match the client's
    directory**, and this is the sharpest edge in the change. A prefix-map rule appends
    the unmatched tail, so a worker directory of `/` rewrites `/home/ci/build` to
    `.home/ci/build` and every system header to `.usr/include/...`. Measured on gcc
    14.2.0 with both rules and the worker's last, `DW_AT_comp_dir` came back
    `.tmp/…/client` — a WRONG object under a correct key, strictly worse than what this
    ticket set out to fix, and invisible to an e2e that runs the node from the fixture's
    own directory. Dropped rather than refused: the client's rule still lands, so gcc is
    fully mapped and only clang on such a node keeps the pre-#506 state, where refusing
    would cost every dispatched compile on every node installed from the shipped unit.
  - **`/` was the PRODUCTION value, and the repair was packaging.** The shipped
    `pace-node.service` set no `WorkingDirectory=`, so systemd started the
    worker in `/` and the case above was not a corner but the ordinary Linux install
    ([#674](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/674)). It now names
    one, and names one the unit itself CREATES — `RuntimeDirectory=pace-node`,
    `WorkingDirectory=/run/pace-node` — because a `WorkingDirectory=` pointing at a
    path nothing creates fails the service at every boot under `ProtectSystem=strict`,
    which is a worse outcome than the defect. `/run` rather than `/tmp`: a worker
    directory that CONTAINS a client's build directory drops the rule exactly as `/`
    does, and CI builds run in `/tmp`.
    The drop above STAYS, because a unit is not the only route: a hand-written one may
    still name `/` or none. And the guard is a SCAN of the shipped file
    (`ctest -R node-working-directory`, with its own selftest): running the real unit
    needs root and a live systemd, so it is reachable only from the packaging job —
    which is not a required context and therefore reports to nobody (#684) — and no
    fixture substitutes, since every one of them starts the node from the FIXTURE's
    directory. That is precisely how #674 reached master with a dispatch e2e green.
  - **The daemonize route was the other half, and it is a PARAMETER now, not a
    constant** ([#784](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/784)).
    `PosixDaemonHost` chdir'd to `/` unconditionally, so `--daemon` landed a worker
    there whatever its unit said — a `WorkingDirectory=` does not survive the double
    fork, because the chdir happens after it. `MakePosixDaemonHost` therefore takes the
    directory and has **no default**: the cache daemon states `/` (it executes nothing,
    so no rule is ever derived from its directory) and the node states
    `Node::ScratchBaseDirectory()`, which it creates before daemonizing. No default is
    the point — a third daemonizing binary meets a compile error rather than inheriting
    an answer chosen for something else.
    - The pidfile is written BEFORE the chdir now. Where a relative one lands must not
      depend on which directory the host was told to move to, or giving the node a
      directory of its own silently relocates its pidfile — the same class of defect.
      It resolves against the invocation directory for both binaries; it used to
      resolve against `/`, where only root can write.
    - Asserted by reading the CALL SITES (`PosixDaemonHost_test`), because that is the
      whole of the defect: one line of `main.cpp`. A compiler-spawning binary's second
      argument may not be a string literal at all; the cache daemon's must be exactly
      `"/"`, and that control is not decoration — without it the rule reads "never pass
      a literal", which refuses a correct tree. Comment-only lines are stripped first,
      and BOTH halves were shown red.
  - **`:` is a path character here.** A Windows absolute path begins `C:\`, and a
    GNU-layout driver on Windows — mingw, or plain clang — is an ordinary client.
    Leaving `:` out of the safe set refused every such client's own directory before
    the driver family was even consulted, so the refusal named the wrong end of the
    fleet.
  - **A worker that cannot honour it REFUSES.** Either directory containing an `=`
    (gcc splits at the last, clang at the first — measured: `/tmp/l506b/eq=sign`
    mapped to `.` gives `.` on gcc 14 and `sign=.=sign` on clang 20, a WRONG
    compilation directory rather than a missing one), or a driver with no such flag.
    Silently skipping the rules returns an object whose compilation directory
    disagrees with a locally built one under the same key, which is this ticket.
  - **The client's model of the flag is the DRIVER's, and it was measured**: the
    last matching rule wins, a longer directory keeps its tail, and the match is a
    BYTE prefix — `/tmp/work=X` against `/tmp/worker` gives `Xer` on both drivers.
    Modelling it at component boundaries reads better and predicts a replacement
    neither compiler writes.
  - **Both halves are covered by `CompileCorrelation`**, on that header's own rule:
    the client knows them before sending and the runner observes them, because they
    become the two halves of the arguments on the line that is spawned. Uncovered, a
    crossed reply is a wrong `DW_AT_comp_dir` under a correct key — this ticket, one
    layer down.
  - The `#line` markers still carry the client's paths, so a dispatched object's
    line table names the producing checkout's headers. On gcc that already matches a
    local compile's, because gcc takes the unit's `DW_AT_name` from the marker — on
    **clang it comes from the INPUT FILE PATH**, so a dispatched object recorded the
    worker's `<scratch>/job-N/<name>` until
    [#660](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/660).
  - **`DW_AT_name` is `comp_dir`'s sibling and needed its own rule** (#660). Two
    consequences, and the second is the one that matters: the debug path named a
    directory on no developer's machine, AND the job counter advances, so two
    dispatches of ONE translation unit to ONE worker produced byte-differing objects
    under one cache key — the exact property a compile cache exists to deny.
    - **The client's spelling TRAVELS, as a REPLACEMENT, never as a path the worker
      opens.** The invariant this was stopped on — *"Nothing the client sent decides
      where a byte lands"*, sitting directly above `create_directories` — is a
      FILESYSTEM guarantee, and `DW_AT_name` is a recorded string. They are not in
      tension, and the same file was already building rules out of client-sent fields
      for `compileDir`. `SafeSourceName` still decides the file the worker creates, and
      `CompileJob_test` asserts that on the paths the worker actually created — captured
      at spawn, because `ScratchGuard` removes the directory before any later look.
    - **NO wire bump, and this was established before an encoder was written.**
      `DecodeCompilePayload` splits an EXACT arity, so a new field would have broken
      every deployed peer and moved `CurrentVersion`/`MinSupportedVersion` 3→4. It is
      not needed: `sourceName` already travels, the client simply stops truncating it,
      and both directions of a mixed fleet degrade to the previous behaviour — an old
      worker sanitizes what arrives exactly as before, and an old client sends no
      directory, so no rule is built.
    - **The WHOLE path is mapped, not the directory**, which is the narrowest rule that
      works: it matches exactly one path, so it cannot reach `comp_dir` or anything
      else, and it survives `SafeSourceName` having renamed the scratch file.
    - **It goes LAST, and the order is the difference between fixed and not fixed.**
      Measured on clang 22.1.8 with the worker-directory rule also matching the scratch
      path: this rule FIRST gives `./scratch/job-7/tu.cpp` — still broken — and LAST
      gives `../src/tu.cpp` with `comp_dir` still `.`. The first measurement of this
      said the order did not matter and was taken through **ccache**, which sits ahead
      of the real compiler on `PATH` on the machine it was measured on; pin the compiler
      by absolute path or the answer is whatever was cached.
    - **Every way of not being able to build it is NO RULE, never a refusal**, unlike
      the `compileDir` rules beside it. Those honour a mapping the client ASKED for, so
      skipping one silently is #506 itself. Nothing asked for this one, and a source
      file whose name carries a space, or an `=`, or an MSVC worker with no path-map
      switch at all, are ordinary. Skipping an `=` is also the NARROW choice: gcc cuts
      `<from>=<to>` at the last separator and clang at the first, so such a rule records
      a name NEITHER machine has, which is worse than recording the worker's.
    - **But the WORKER's half of that same skip is a startup property, and is said at
      startup** ([#810](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/810)).
      `scratchSourcePath` lies under a root the process chose ONCE, so a root carrying a
      space (`/Users/john doe/...`, an ordinary macOS home) or an `=` makes EVERY rule on
      that worker unspellable and every dispatched object goes back to `job-N` — nothing
      counting it, and `dist-compile-e2e` blind to it because its scratch root is
      well-behaved. `ScratchRootMappingWarnings` is a pure function the claim site logs;
      the call site still SKIPS, because such a machine compiles perfectly well and only
      its debug names degrade.
      - It is asked of the LONGEST path a job on that root can produce, never the root:
        the rule's left-hand side is `<root>/job-<n>/<name>`, so a root a few bytes under
        the length ceiling is spellable while every path beneath it is not, and checking
        the root alone answers `fine` for a worker on which every rule is skipped.
      - It is asked of every prefix-map row the TABLE holds rather than of the families
        this node serves: the served set exists only once the survey's first round lands
        on the heartbeat thread (#365), minutes after the operator stopped watching.
      - The warning and the rule builder are asserted TOGETHER. A warning where the
        builder is happy is noise, silence where it skips is the defect, and either
        assertion alone passes under a predicate that answers constantly.
    - **The client sends what its own compile would RECORD, not what the build system
      wrote** ([#800](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/800)). An
      ABSOLUTE source argument matched by a rule on the line records the MAPPED spelling
      locally, so `sourceName` carries the source put through
      `MappedByPrefixMapRules` — the computation `MappedCompileDirectory` was already
      built on, now named for what it does rather than for the one value it was first
      asked about. One model of the flag, asked twice; a second would be a second thing
      to be wrong. Measured on clang 22.1.8: the dispatched `DW_AT_name` becomes
      byte-identical to the local one where it was the raw absolute path.
      - **It does not reach gcc on its own, and that is a different residual with a
        different cause** — gcc takes `DW_AT_name` from the `#line` marker, so no rule
        the worker builds matches it and both spellings give the raw absolute path
        (measured, gcc 16.2.1). Closed by a SECOND pair, `sourceRoot` /
        `sourceRootReplacement`, carrying the raw spelling beside the mapped one
        ([#883](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/883)) — a rewrite
        rule needs two operands and `sourceName` is already the mapped half, so the raw
        half has to travel too. It cannot ride `compileDir`, whose halves are the
        compilation DIRECTORY and are what `comp_dir` rules are built from.
        - **Ordered between the other two**, and the sandwich is the whole of it: after
          the compilation-directory rules, because this replacement is already the answer
          of every client-side rule applied in order and must outrank a rule
          reconstructing one of them; before #660's source-NAME rule, which its own block
          requires to be last. All three can match one path — an in-tree build's source
          lies under its build directory — and both drivers honour the LAST match, so a
          rule in the wrong place is silently overridden with every counter normal.
        - **A half-filled pair is REFUSED where a directory's is not.**
          `-fdebug-prefix-map=<builddir>=` maps a root to nothing and is a real
          reproducible-build spelling, so `WorkerPrefixMapRules` reads the DIRECTORY
          alone as saying whether a mapping is in force. A source file mapped to nothing
          is not a spelling of anything.
        - Every other way of not building the rule is NO RULE, `WorkerSourceNameRule`'s
          answer rather than `WorkerPrefixMapRules`': both operands are the client's own
          strings, `my file.cpp` is ordinary, and what is left when it is skipped is the
          pre-#883 raw path — the same on every machine that dispatches it — rather than
          the nondeterministic `job-N` #660 was about. Neither operand is a property of
          the worker, so there is no #810-shaped startup warning to pair with it.
        - The correlation digest covers the pair and its tag moved with it
          (`compile-corr-v3`): the client knows both before sending and the runner
          observes both, so leaving it out would let a crossed reply through on exactly
          the axis the pair exists to fix.
      - A RELATIVE source argument — the common case — matches no absolute rule, so
        nothing about it changes. The fallback is the ORIGINAL spelling, and an empty
        replacement falls back too: legal for a directory, a name `SafeSourceName` would
        replace anyway.
      - MSVC keeps its own residual for the same reason `cl` has no row here at all.
  - Read `comp_dir` and `DW_AT_name`, never compare objects: two different-but-checkout-independent
    mappings compare EQUAL, which is how the rule-order defect above first read
    green. `dist-compile-e2e --case suite` case 13 runs the launcher from a
    directory the worker is not in — a case compiled in the worker's own directory
    passes with the fix reverted — and asserts the value rather than only the
    agreement, because two readers that both return nothing agree perfectly. It is
    the only case in that fixture that opens the debug records, and it is what
    caught the worker-directory-only design that every unit test had accepted.
    - **Case 14 is the source-name half, and its ARRANGEMENT is the case.** Case 13's
      source lies outside every mapped root, so both objects record the same raw path
      and agree for a reason unrelated to the subject; moving it under `$mapdir` does
      not repair that, because `$mapdir` is the launcher's compile directory and the
      compilation-directory rule maps that path as a side effect — green with #883
      reverted. So case 14's mapped source root is DISJOINT from the compile directory,
      asserted rather than assumed, and the reference object is required to be MAPPED
      before the agreement is read: two unmapped objects agree with the whole feature
      removed.
- **`check_<lang>_compiler_flag` is asked only for an ENABLED language.** It is a
  hard `CMake Error` otherwise ("C: needs to be enabled before use"), and this
  module is included from a `project()` that lists CXX first — so the first run
  ended the configure outright, which is the one thing
  `cmake/portable/CompileCache.cmake` may never do.
- **Skipped, rejected and applied are three states and the STATUS line says
  which.** A driver that rejected the flag still caches, still shares, and still
  replays objects naming another checkout; a line reporting only the applied half
  would read the same in all three cases.

### An object that names its producer's roots is keyed apart, and only the OBJECT can say so

The debug records above are the accepted cost; this is their program-visible sibling,
and it is not accepted. A string the PROGRAM reads that names the producing checkout --
an assertion message, a log line, a Catch2 location -- points a developer at a tree they
are not building, and a hit serves it to every other checkout that computes the key.

**Measured**, `cl` 14.51 through the installed launcher, two byte-identical checkouts
compiled one after the other (the second row is what the second checkout printed):

<!-- table-total: none -->
| spelling | `__FILE__`, direct on | `__FILE__`, direct off | `source_location`, either |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| absolute source (every CMake compile) | HIT, **the first checkout's path** | MISS, own path | HIT, **the first checkout's path** |
| absolute plus `/FC` | HIT, **the first checkout's path** | MISS, own path | HIT, **the first checkout's path** |
| relative source | HIT, relative (correct) | HIT, relative (correct) | HIT, relative (correct) |
| relative plus `/FC` | HIT, **the first checkout's path** | MISS, own path | HIT, **the first checkout's path** |

**Why no key can see it.** `ComputeManifestKey` hashes the stamp, the `<SRCROOT>` token of
the source and the relativized arguments -- in which an absolute source and `-I` are both
`<SRCROOT>/...` -- and `ValidateManifest` re-hashes each dependency's CONTENT, so two
checkouts reach one manifest and it validates. `source_location::current()` and
`__builtin_FILE()` are filled in by the compiler from the presumed file name, after
preprocessing, and `/EP` / `-E -P` suppress the markers that would carry it, deliberately.
Predicting it from the command line is not available either: `__FILE__`, the builtin, a
`#line`, `/FC`, MSVC's `assert` (a WIDE `__FILE__`) and a path-valued macro nobody
anticipated all reach the same bytes. Folding the absolute roots into every key whose
source is spelled absolutely is correct, and ends cross-checkout sharing for every CMake
compile -- the rejected alternative.

**The mechanism is `apps/pace-cc/RootBinding.hpp`, and the header carries the whole
argument.** At STORE time the launcher scans the object's program-visible sections for
the parts of its own checkout -- source root, build tree, working directory, each in the
build's spelling and the resolved one. An object naming none keeps today's key and
today's sharing. An object naming one is stored under a key that folds in the parts it
NAMES and nothing else (`rootbound-v2`), with a MARKER at the portable key listing them;
a consumer that meets the marker folds ITS OWN values for those parts, so another
checkout MISSES -- failing closed -- and stores its own bound copy, while the producing
checkout HITs its own.
Direct mode resolves to the portable key and meets the marker there, and a dispatched
compile is stored by the same code, scanned against the CLIENT's roots. Measured after:
every bold cell above becomes a MISS naming the compiling checkout's own path, the
producing checkout re-compiling HITs its bound copy, and a translation unit naming no
path HITs across the two checkouts in every spelling.

- **The scan errs BROAD, because missing a spelling is wrong-but-looks-right.** Both
  separators and a run of them, case folded, every non-ASCII run one wildcard (a
  code-page `__FILE__` is one byte where the root's UTF-8 is two), narrow, UTF-16LE and
  UTF-32LE at every alignment, debug records NAMED as the exclusion rather than program
  data named as the inclusion, and a section that cannot be read as bytes -- LTO IR,
  embedded bitcode, a compressed section, `cl /GL`'s anonymous object -- BOUND. Over-
  recognising costs one translation unit its sharing; under-recognising serves another
  checkout's path.
- **The debug records stay out of the scan**, for #203's reason: they name the producing
  checkout on every compile with debug info, and counting them would end sharing for
  every debug build.
- **The key folds what the object is OBSERVED to name, never the whole checkout.**
  `rootbound-v1` folded all three parts, and `launcher-replay-e2e` then missed 32 times in
  a warm build of the same source in a second build directory: every miss a `*_test.cpp`
  whose object names the source root (Catch2's `__FILE__`) and no build directory at all.
  It is "only machine-independent dependency paths are hashed", applied to the binding.
  The marker carries the parts BY NAME, because the fetch cannot see the object first; a
  marker this build cannot read is refused as undecodable, never followed.
- **The marker is a current-generation `CompileValue` with a versioned blob and NO text
  region, and `CompileValueVersion` did not move for it.** It passes `CanonicalStoredValue`
  unchanged on every server (nothing to rewrite), a server of another generation refuses
  it by its leading byte as it refuses everything else, and only launchers deriving
  `objkey-v7` keys can reach one. A stored object always carries two regions, so the
  recogniser cannot take an object for a marker; `ResolveFetchedObject` is the one place a
  fetched value is classified, and it follows a marker at most once.
- **`objkey-v7` and `manifest-v7` moved together**, and the manifest half is required on
  its own: a `v6` manifest is shared between checkouts and points straight at the
  producer's object. The object half retires every entry stored before the scan existed.
- **A hit `PACE_VERIFY` rejects is `VERIFY-MISMATCH`, never `HIT`**, in
  `invocations.log`, on the trace line and in `--show-stats` (`Outcome::VerifyMismatch`).
  The verifier compiles to the same path, so the build links the fresh object; logging
  it as a hit counted every wrong object the verifier caught as a success. Note what it
  still reports on `cl`: a cross-checkout hit of a portable object differs in
  `.debug$S`, which the verifier does not excuse (the section above), so a verified
  cross-checkout `cl` hit is a `VERIFY-MISMATCH` by design.
- **Residuals, stated where they apply**: a root reached through an alias neither spelling
  names is not found; and two spellings of ONE root that tokenize alike share the
  portable key, so only an exported root spelled differently keys apart.

## Two servers on one wire are two VERSIONS on one wire

<!-- agent-tripwire: And by every **VERSION** of them, or the rule holds at no moment a fleet is actually in -->

`AGENT.md` requires every server on this wire to canonicalize a stored value's text
regions identically, through the one `CanonicalStoredValue`. That rule was written
about a *moment* — the moment #229 made a compile node a second server and it turned
out to have no copy of the recipe. But a fleet is permanently mid-upgrade
([#173](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/173)), so the servers
on the wire are at several builds at once and the property has to hold **across
generations or it does not hold at all**
([#483](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/483)). Two routes
were open to breaking it, and neither needed anybody's install to be stale.

- **The version byte named nothing.** `PathCanon` deliberately carries no version of
  its own and says so, on the reasoning that canonical text travels only inside a
  `CompileValue` and that container carries `CompileValueVersion` — so a change to
  the canonicalization spec is *expressed by bumping that*. Correct, and enforced by
  nothing: the byte was a bare constant referenced by the encoder and the decoder.
  Widen a grammar's span match, change how a root is joined back on, move a byte of
  framing — every behaviour-pinning test in the tree is updated to the new
  expectation, as it must be, and the value ships still calling itself generation 1.
  Two servers then stamp one number on text they rewrote by different rules, which
  is a wrong value under a correct key at fleet scale.
  - **The pin is a conformance digest paired with the byte**, in
    `CompileValue_test.cpp`: a corpus of regions run through `CanonicalStoredValue`
    and `PathCanon::LocalizeRegion`, digested, and matched against the row for the
    live `CompileValueVersion`. A digest alone would not do it — the behaviour and
    the golden are one edit two hunks apart, and moving both leaves the suite green,
    which is `RequireNoRetiredDigest`'s argument arriving at the same place from the
    key side. Retired rows stay, and what makes a reverted bump fail is STRUCTURAL:
    generations are unique and ascending and the live byte names the LAST row, so
    putting the byte back names an earlier one however good the digest pasted with it.
    Both halves are `src/tests/RetiredGenerations.hpp` since #548 — the shared home the
    two key types forced, a library test being unable to include an app header — and the
    consolidation is what made the two tables' DIFFERENCE statable in one place: the key
    side can assert digest-inequality because its inputs are frozen, and this side cannot
    because its corpus grows.
    It used to be "the live digest must reproduce none of them", which reads like the
    same guard and is not one: the digest frames `canonical.bytes`, whose leading byte
    IS the version, so two generations are unequal by construction and that check
    could not fail. And a retired digest is a dated record besides — it describes the
    corpus as that generation met it, which the next corpus row invalidates
    ([#583](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/583)).
  - **A bump's claim is checkable from generation 4 forward, and the aggregate digest
    could never have carried it** (#583). The digest is a FOLD, so it answers *the
    behaviour moved* and cannot answer WHICH rows moved — which is the only claim a
    bump actually makes. `Generation4Rows` freezes the corpus PER ROW, and a second
    frozen generation without a `GenerationBumps` row naming what it moved fails the
    **build**, not a test: this is a *do something* obligation, so it belongs to the
    type system. The ticket asked instead for a frozen corpus so a retired digest
    could be **re-derived**, and that cannot be built at all: `ConformanceDigest`
    folds the outputs of PRODUCTION functions, so the digest is a function of the
    corpus AND of current behaviour, and a bump moves the behaviour half by
    definition. Freezing the inputs alone yields today's behaviour over old inputs —
    a number that is neither the retired digest nor anything a reader can interpret,
    and worse than none because it would look like a re-derivation. So generations 1
    to 3 stay DATED RECORDS by decision rather than by omission: recovering them needs
    their behaviour, which is gone, and that is an accepted cost rather than open
    work. Two frozen rows sharing a digest is the canonicalization WORKING — the two
    bare-drive-root rows differ only on the producer side and erasing that difference
    is the whole point — so equal-today is not redundant, and deleting one is the
    available mistake.
  - **Measured, because a guard nobody has watched refuse is not a guard**: an edit to
    `JoinLocalized` — which changes what every consumer replays — is refused by
    **exactly one** case in the whole suite, the pin. Stated that way on purpose: the
    figure was written twice as *2006 of 2007* and *2007 of 2008*, one restatement per
    citation, and both went stale the next time anybody added a test. The count of
    cases that refuse it is the fact; the suite total is the condition it was measured
    under, and it moves. The first cut of the corpus refused it nowhere at all, because
    it exercised bare roots only as a PRODUCER; a rewrite and its inverse are one spec,
    so both ends of every shape reach the digest. That miss generalises past this
    file and is [#547](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/547):
    **a corpus that varies one side of a transformation and fixes the other cannot
    see a defect on the fixed side, and looks complete while doing it** — everything
    passes, which is exactly what a corpus with a hole looks like.
  - **A grammar is a spec change the digest cannot see on its own**, so the corpus's
    completeness is asked OF THE DECODER rather than restated: all 256 tag bytes are
    offered to `DecodeCompileValue` and every one it accepts must have a row. A
    hand-kept list of grammars would be exact about the ones it knows and silent
    about the one just added, which is the failure the check exists to prevent. What
    makes a new grammar a spec change is the far end: an older build meets the tag,
    `IsKnownGrammar` refuses it, the decoder calls that a malformed frame rather than
    a foreign generation, and a server whose policy for malformed bytes is *store
    verbatim* then stores the producer's absolute paths.
  - **A guard's MESSAGE is part of the guard, and two correct refusals can still
    route an author past both.** Adding a grammar fails the coverage case, which asks
    for a corpus row; adding that row moves the digest, which fails the generation
    case, whose message offered *"you widened the corpus, repin"* first. Both
    refusals were right. From the author's seat that clause reads as precisely what
    they just did — so the pair walked them into shipping a canonicalization change
    under the generation it was not written by, which is this section's own defect
    reproduced one level up, inside the fix for it. **The remedy a refusal offers
    FIRST is the one that gets taken**, so a message reachable by two different edits
    has to name both and say which is which: the repin branch is narrowed to
    behaviour ALREADY in this generation and points at the grammar case as not being
    that, and the coverage case asks for the row *and* the bump. Note how it was
    found — by reading, in review. Every test was green, and a message is not
    something a suite can be wrong about.
  - **A digest cannot tell a row that does work from one that does not**, and that
    is a property of digests rather than a flaw in this one: both rows contribute
    bytes, so a corpus can grow, read as thorough, and assert progressively less. The
    bare-root row added here was the demonstration — it was commented *"a bare root
    produces, and a bare root consumes"* and did **neither**, because nothing
    canonicalized so there was no token, so there was nothing to localize either. The
    guard that caught the `JoinLocalized` mutation fired on the *drive-root* row
    instead, and everything still passed. `RegionEffect` is the assertion the digest
    structurally cannot make: each row declares `Rewrites` or `Preserves` per side and
    is checked against what actually happened
    ([#547](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/547)).
    - **A declaration, not "every row must change something."** Two rows here are
      deliberately inert and always will be — canonicalizing a region that already
      carries tokens must be a no-op or canonicalizing twice would be a second
      rewrite, and the empty region exists to prove the framing survives with no text.
      A guard that has to be waived twice is a guard on its way to becoming
      decoration.
    - It also **says which row broke**. Measured: reverting the producer fix fails the
      digest once and the effect assertion four times — both sides of both bare-root
      rows, since with nothing canonicalized there is no token for the consumer to
      localize either — and each failure names its row. The digest alone can only
      report that something moved.
  - **Vary BOTH sides of a transformation, or the corpus cannot see the side it
    fixed.** The bare-root miss was producer-varied and consumer-fixed, and the
    mutation written specifically to prove the guard bites passed all 2007 cases
    because of it. The audit that followed enumerated every root shape against both
    sides and found the defect on **four cells across two shapes** — plus a bare
    WINDOWS producer absent from the corpus in any form, which neither the inertness
    check nor the one-sided check would have found alone. Two shapes that were also
    varied on one side only, drive-relative and UNC, turned out to be **correct** —
    which is the point: nothing distinguished them from the broken ones beforehand, so
    they get rows too. A row documenting a shape as sound is worth as much as one that
    catches a defect.
  - **It also pins the digest across HOSTS.** Every entry point in `PathCanon`
    derives its conventions from the layout rather than from the running binary, so
    the corpus yields one digest on Windows, Linux and macOS. A change that broke
    that would make a Windows server and a POSIX one disagree about a value they both
    hold — the same defect with no version skew anywhere near it.
- **A THIRD route, and it needed no disagreement at all: the grammar found no span
  to rewrite.** The two above are servers disagreeing about text they both recognise.
  `Grammar::ShowIncludes` recognised a note only when the line began with the literal
  English `Note: including file:` — so on a localized `cl` the region held nothing the
  canonicalizer could see and was stored with the producing checkout's absolute paths in
  it. Every server agreed perfectly, about nothing, and a replayed region becomes the
  object's dependency record, so it never invalidates. Generation 3 closes it
  ([#879](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/879)).
  [#891](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/891) rode along on a
  reading of `cl`'s inclusion-depth indentation as preceding the marker, and generation 5
  reverses it: see **The anchor is the load-bearing half** below, and the measurement in
  the entry that closed [#1270](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1270).
  - **The MARKER is a canonical form, exactly as `<SRCROOT>` is.** The launcher
    normalizes its own prefix to `PathCanon::IncludeNoteMarker` before a value is
    stored and restores this build's prefix after a hit is localized, so the stored
    bytes are locale-free and no server ever meets a prefix it does not know.
    Labelling the region with the producer's prefix instead was the obvious
    alternative and is worse: it puts a second variable into the one place two
    machines must agree byte-for-byte, and it buys nothing, because a consumer has to
    re-render into its OWN `msvc_deps_prefix` regardless.
  - **The rewriting is the LAUNCHER's, and that is forced rather than chosen.** Only
    the producing machine knows what language its own notes are in; a server
    canonicalizing a STORE cannot recover it from the bytes, and an environment
    variable on the CONSUMER answers a different question. So "every server
    canonicalizes identically" keeps holding *by construction* — which is why closing
    a fleet-wide value defect changed neither server and touched no 0xFC field.
  - **Both marker rewrites are inside the conformance digest**, each with its own
    effect column (`storeMarkerEffect`, `replayMarkerEffect`). They are separate calls
    in separate places — the store side before a value leaves the launcher, the replay
    side *after* the stale-hit guard, which reads the canonical marker through
    `ParseIncludePaths` and would silently find nothing to check if the restore ran
    first — so a fix to one says nothing about the other, and one shared column could
    never fail for a value produced in German and replayed in English.
  - **What it does not close**: a localized toolchain that has named no prefix. An
    unmatched marker rewrites nothing, so such a machine is where it was rather than
    worse, and [#878](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/878) is
    the remaining door. It needs **no further generation** — the stored form is
    already locale-free, so #878 only supplies a better value to normalize with.
  - **The anchor is the load-bearing half of the recognition rule, and #891 gave half
    of it away for a shape no driver emits.** Both regions a launcher stores are tagged
    `ShowIncludes` and one of them is the DIAGNOSTIC stream, so a marker matched
    anywhere in a line rewrites a path a compiler merely quoted — and one layer up,
    where `SplitIncludeNotes` runs over text that is also preprocessed SOURCE, it
    deletes an ordinary line from the bytes the key is hashed over. **COLUMN ZERO,
    nothing in front of the marker at all**, through one `PathCanon::IncludeNoteMarkerEnd`
    that all three readers now genuinely share rather than agreeing by hand.

    What made the loosening look free was reading `cl`'s inclusion-depth indentation as
    preceding the marker. It does not: the marker is at column zero on every note and the
    depth is blanks BETWEEN marker and path, so it rides inside the run the path grammar
    already skips and survives untouched without the anchor knowing it exists. Measured
    2026-09-19 on Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26200, Visual Studio 18 Community, MSVC
    14.44.35207 and 14.51.36231 plus that install's `clang-cl` as the control, under `/c`
    and under `/EP`, at depths one to six — and reproduced the other way round: `cl /EP`
    over two revisions of a file differing only inside an indented raw string literal
    emits `  Note: including file: A` / `  Note: including file: B`, which the widened
    rule deleted, keying the two identically
    ([#1270](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1270), generation 5).

    **The general lesson is where the two facts live.** `<indent><marker>` and
    `<marker><indent>` are one sentence apart in English and opposite rules in code, and
    the ticket that fixed the wrong one cited the right shape in its own body. Nobody ran
    the compiler. A claim about a tool is checked against the tool — and a claim about
    a tool's TEXT is checked by printing column numbers, not by reading the text.

  - **A `PathCanon` regression test whose fixture lies outside BOTH roots cannot fail.**
    Its own rule, because AGENT.md's *a regression test can fail to reproduce its
    regression* does not reach it and the next person writing one of these will meet it.
    `Canonicalize` echoes a path under neither root verbatim — that is the contract, and
    it is what lets a toolchain path survive a round trip — so `CanonicalizeRegion` returns
    the input unchanged whether the grammar called the line a note or **passed over it**.
    Recognition and pass-through are then one passing assertion.
    Measured: #1270's first reproduction was `cl /EP` output for two revisions differing
    only inside an indented raw string, asserted through `CanonicalizeRegion`, and it was
    GREEN with the anchor neutered. Reading it finds nothing — the assertion is exactly
    right. **Put the fixture's path UNDER a root**, so a rule that matched would produce
    `<SRCROOT>/…` and asserting the input comes back IS asserting the refusal; and where
    the defect is one layer up, pin it one layer up — `SplitIncludeNotes` DELETING the
    line is the thing that mis-serves, and `DependencyProbe_test` is where that goes red.

- **The reader could not tell a foreign value from a damaged one.**
  `CanonicalStoredValue` returned `std::optional`, and its `nullopt` meant both "these
  bytes are not a stored value" and "this IS one, of a generation I do not
  implement". The two servers apply *opposite* policies to that single state — the
  daemon refuses, a node's cache tier stores the bytes **verbatim**, each defensible
  for genuinely opaque bytes — so a launcher at generation N storing into a node at
  N+1 put the producing checkout's absolute paths into the shared cache under a key
  every machine computes. That is #229/#319 reached by nothing worse than a rolling
  upgrade, and it is `.agent/rules/metrics-and-observability.md`'s four-states rule:
  an `optional` cannot carry it.
  - `CanonicalizationOutcome` names three, and what protects a caller is **switching
    on it with no `default:`**, never the empty `bytes` that `ForeignGeneration`
    carries. Empty bytes stop a server storing *nothing*; they do not stop one
    storing the ORIGINAL, and a node's verbatim fallback was never the canonical
    bytes but the STORE's own payload — so `outcome == Canonicalized ? canonical.bytes
    : payload` compiles, reads naturally, and reinstates the whole defect. No type
    can refuse that. The exhaustive switch is what makes the third state impossible
    to leave out.
  - `DecodeCompileValue` answers `UnsupportedFeature` for an unknown generation and
    `MalformedFrame` for everything else, and the classifier reads that code back
    rather than re-testing the version byte: two spellings of one rule are two places
    for it to drift. It is `.agent/rules/storage.md`'s `UnsupportedFormatVersion`
    against `Corrupt`, one layer up and on the wire instead of on disk — and for the
    same reason, since the obvious remedy for a cache reported corrupt is to wipe it.
  - **Another generation is proved, never inferred from the leading byte alone** —
    and the first cut of this got it backwards, which the OTHER server's tests caught
    rather than any reasoning here. Almost no opaque blob begins with `0x01`, so
    "leading byte is not ours" called every opaque value foreign and refused it,
    overturning the node cache tier's documented policy of storing an opaque value
    verbatim — a policy this layer does not own. `DecodeAfterGeneration` therefore
    runs on the rest of the frame too, and only a layout that holds together is
    reported as a generation. The shape that matters (#547 — framing kept,
    canonicalization moved) is then caught exactly. **The residual is not the harmless
    direction, and saying so was this bullet's own first mistake**: a generation that
    moves the FRAMING as well reads as junk, comes back `NotACompileValue`, and a
    node's tier handles THAT by storing verbatim — so it re-enters through the door
    this closes, for the class of bump most likely to cause it, since
    `CompileValueVersion` names the framing too and nothing couples it to an
    `objkey-v*` bump. Bounded rather than closed: the daemon refuses
    `NotACompileValue`, so the forward cannot reach the shared cache, and a tier is
    loopback-only. Bounds are not a fix, so it is tracked. The general form is the one worth carrying: **absence
    of the expected value is not evidence of a particular alternative**, and a
    classifier built on it will be confidently wrong about everything that is merely
    unfamiliar.
  - **No tag moved for this.** Nothing observable about generation 1 changed, so the
    population of values stored verbatim by this route is empty **by construction**.
    The reason is the FRAMING, not the generation byte: this route needs a bump that
    moves the layout, and no bump has. Saying instead that "`CompileValueVersion` has
    never moved" was a weaker claim wearing the same words, and it expired at
    [#547](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/547) — generation 2
    exists, generation-1 values are in the field, and the `ForeignGeneration` refusal
    above is doing work today while this residual is still empty. Two conditions that
    happened to hold together are not one condition.
- **The launcher says which of the two it met.** `DecodeFailureReason` gives a
  foreign generation its own `--show-stats` row, because a mixed fleet is a rolling
  upgrade that ends by itself while a malformed value is a defect somebody has to
  look at, and an operator does different things about them. Otherwise an upgrade
  window presents as an endlessly cold cache with no diagnostic, which this wire has
  already recorded paying for once.

### A stream region's grammar must cover EVERY line language that stream can carry

A stored text region carries ONE grammar tag, and a line that grammar cannot see is
stored verbatim -- with the producing checkout's absolute path in it, replayed into every
consumer. So the tag of a console stream is a claim about every kind of line the driver
can write on that stream, and a grammar that covers one of them is a grammar that
misses the rest in silence.

- **It shipped that way for the whole MSVC family until value generation 6.** Both
  streams were tagged `Grammar::ShowIncludes`, which rewrites note lines only, because
  #825 showed the notes move between the streams with the flag -- so neither stream
  could take a diagnostics-only grammar, and nobody wrote one that did both. Every
  `cl` and `clang-cl` warning, error and `note:` a hit replayed named the checkout that
  stored it. MEASURED by the investigation that found it: C4100 in a header, two
  byte-identical checkouts, direct mode OFF, a key the two share by design and a
  correct object -- the defect was the text around it. `Grammar::MsvcDiagnostics`
  existed, was unit-tested, and reached no production region: **a correct grammar
  nothing tags a region with is this bug**, which is why `Cc::StreamGrammar` lives
  where a test can reach it.
- **The union is a list of line rules, and it has FOUR members, not two.**
  `Grammar::MsvcStream` is the `/showIncludes` note, the MSVC diagnostic head, the
  GCC-style include chain -- which `clang-cl` writes on this same stream in front of a
  header's diagnostic (`In file included from <path>:1:`) -- and the GCC-style head, which
  `clang-cl -fdiagnostics-format=clang` writes instead of `(line,col): `. MEASURED while capturing the
  test shapes (VS 18 Community, MSVC 14.51 and its clang-cl); a notes-plus-diagnostics
  union read from the ticket would have left that line naming the producer. Capture
  the driver's real output before writing the grammar; the shapes a ticket lists are
  the ones somebody looked at.
- **The diagnostic head is anchored and TIGHT**: `<path>(<digits>[,<digits>])` then `): `
  or `) : ` -- the second being the `#pragma message(__FILE__ "(" ... ") : warning: ...")`
  idiom MSVC documents, which direct mode shares across checkouts and only this grammar
  keeps local (Job 2 review, I2, measured end to end). A parenthesis that opens no location
  is stepped over. `/diagnostics:caret` (and clang-cl's `N | source` echo) put SOURCE on the
  stream, and **what keeps an indented echo intact is the ROOT match** -- a span is
  rewritten only when it begins with a root, and an indented span begins with blanks.
  The column-zero check is defensive, and removing it turns nothing red. What is still
  rewritten is a column-zero source line that itself begins with an in-root path and a
  numeric location, which only a raw string or a comment continuation produces.
- **The note-only readers stay note-only.** The stale-hit guard extracts dependencies
  from an `MsvcStream` region through the notes parser alone -- a diagnostic quotes a
  path without declaring a dependency on it -- and the emit-side `..` collapse walks
  such a region under `ShowIncludes`. `PathCanon::CarriesIncludeNotes` is the one
  answer to "can this region carry notes", separate from "which lines does this
  grammar rewrite".
- **A new line language is a new generation.** A grammar's rules are part of the
  canonicalization spec, so adding one to a stream's grammar moves `CompileValueVersion`
  and adds corpus rows, exactly as `MsvcStream` did; the grammar-coverage case in
  `CompileValue_test.cpp` refuses a decodable tag no corpus row exercises. The Job 2
  review's I1, I2, M3 and M4 moved it again, to generation 7, although generation 6 had
  never left the branch that introduced it: a server built from that branch still
  stamps 6 on text it rewrites the old way, and the frozen-row check says so in as many
  words. "It never shipped" is not an argument the version byte can hear.

## The key, the object and the manifest describe ONE moment

<!-- agent-tripwire: The key, the object and the manifest are taken at THREE moments -->

The launcher reads its inputs three times: the key's preprocess (T1), the compile (T2, and a
dispatched compile's second preprocess), and the manifest. Before
[#1650](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1650) the manifest hashed the
files AFTER the compile, so a save during it paired the new content with the old object; every
later build of the new content was a direct HIT on the old object, exit 0, in every checkout and
on every machine whose files matched -- and the manifest key is portable, so it spread.

`Cc::InputWitness` fences T0 and identifies the TU before the key, snapshots every project input
(identity and content hash) at T1′, after it, and re-identifies them at T2, after the compile;
`Cc::StabilityTable` decides, and `main.cpp` reads the row and writes no `switch`.
A manifest's hashes are the T1′ hashes -- `BuildManifest` takes them from its REQUIRED
`IManifestContent` and never reads a file -- an object is stored only when nothing moved, and the
hit a racing backfill would have spoiled is still served. Five rules make it hold, and the first
four were each wrong in a draft of #1650 before they were right:

- **Identity, not the clock, after T1′, for every input snapshotted there.** An entry is compared by change
  time, size, volume and file id, never by last-write time alone (FAT and exFAT keep no change
  time, so theirs stands in): `copy` and robocopy keep a file's mtime, `utimensat` sets it, and on
  NTFS `CopyFileW` copies the SOURCE's change time as well (measured during #1650, on two
  volumes). So an older file copied over a newer one is seen by its IDENTITY; a rewrite in the
  same clock tick is seen the same way, since every T1′ stamp lies below the floored T0. A path
  named ONLY by the build's own `-MF` (read when the probe reported nothing) has no T1′ snapshot
  and is judged by the clock alone, at T2 and when its manifest entry is hashed.
- **T0 is FENCED, against the FINE clock.** `IInputFiles::Fence()` reads the fine clock at the
  call, waits for the coarse clock to read strictly above both that and its own first reading,
  and returns that coarse reading -- so, where the clocks behave as assumed (an earlier stamp
  never above the fine clock, a later one never below the coarse clock) and under
  `ChangedAtOrAfter`'s condition, a save made before the fence is stamped below T0 and one made
  after it at or above. That is a property of the clocks, NOT an unconditional fact: see the
  limits below. Waiting only for the coarse clock to CHANGE was wrong, and it is two halves. The
  CLOCK half is the Linux timekeeper's, measured on WSL 6.6: the coarse clock reads the last tick
  boundary the timekeeper accumulated, which trails its publication and holds until the next one,
  so it lags real time by up to about TWO ticks (7.45 ms on WSL's 4 ms tick), and its first new
  reading can lie at or below a fine-clock instant read before the fence -- in about 20 to 100 of
  100 runs there, varying per boot. A unit case asks it of the machine's own clocks; on Windows
  that case checks the property but cannot tell the old fence from the new (0 of 200 there). The
  STAMPING half is Linux 6.13+, whose multigrain timestamps stamp a file stat'ed since its last
  change with a FINE time, carrying that lag into FILE STAMPS -- MEASURED: 57 of 60 such saves
  read as after the fence on `Linux-gcc-release-arm64` in CI; the multigrain cause is INFERRED, no
  local kernel stamps that way, and a scripted-clock case stands in for it. Without any fence, 5
  of 30 compiles launched right after a write refused to store (WSL, 4 ms ticks; measured, and 30
  of 30 stored with it). Read T0 COARSELY, too: a finer clock can read later than the stamp
  of a change that follows it.
- **Every comparison with T0 is `Cc::ChangedAtOrAfter`, never a raw `>=`.** It floors T0 to the
  grid the stamp itself shows -- the largest of 2 s, then each decimal unit from 1 s down to
  10 ns, that divides it -- because exFAT stamps at 10 ms and HFS+ at 1 s, and a change in T0's
  own slot is stamped BELOW T0. A blanket floor (ccache's "include file too new") is not the
  answer: it would stop caching every consumer of a header generated in the same second.
- **An input that cannot be observed is `UNCACHEABLE`, never `INPUTS-MOVED`**, whose text
  promises the next build caches; an unreadable input usually stays unreadable. The statistics
  `detail` is the row's FIXED sentence, so `--show-stats` ranks one row per cause, and the path
  is on the `PACE_VERBOSE` line -- which, for a save during the compile in direct mode, is
  written AFTER the manifest was recorded and says whether it was.
- **Nothing the witness holds travels.** No identity, instant or verdict reaches a key, a
  manifest, a `CompileValue` or the wire, or two checkouts stop sharing;
  `InputWitness_test`'s two-checkout case pins the bytes. `manifest-v8` retired every manifest
  recorded before the fix, and `objkey-v*` deliberately did not move.

**Known limits.** Every one of them is a place where only the clock answers, or nothing does
([#1654](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1654)). The first five fail
OPEN -- a wrong object can be stored -- and the last fails CLOSED:

- A header REPLACED during the key's preprocess (T0 to T1′) by a copy that keeps an older change
  time (`CopyFileW` on NTFS) reads as older than T0, and nothing earlier snapshots it, because the
  header set is unknown until the preprocess has run. For a snapshotted header, a copy after T1′
  changes the identity and is caught; for an `-MF`-only path, which has no T1′ identity, the
  window runs until its manifest entry is hashed (after the STORE on a miss; at the backfill on a hit). [#1653](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1653).
- A header CREATED at any point of the invocation, the compile included, in an include
  directory searched before the one the preprocess resolved is in no snapshot and checked by
  nothing: at T2 the late paths are the probe's own set, all already entries (ccache has the
  same gap). [#1654](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1654).
- A stamp from ANOTHER machine's clock that lags this one (a network share, a WSL `/mnt/<drive>`
  the Windows host stamps), and a stamp grid that is neither 2 s nor a decimal unit. The TU's
  own T0/T1′ comparison still holds there; a header's T0 comparison does not, and for an
  `-MF`-only path the window runs until its manifest entry is hashed (after the STORE on a miss; at the backfill on a hit). Documented, not filed: refusing remote filesystems
  would remove a feature.
- FAT and exFAT keep no change time, so their last-write time stands in, and `CopyFile` keeps a
  last-write time (FAT's is 2 s granular): the T0 rule is weaker there. The TU's T0/T1′
  comparison and the identity comparison after T1′ still hold.
- Where no coarse clock answers -- macOS in practice -- the fence waits a 10 ms margin
  (`FineClockSafetyTick`) and moves the fine reading back by it. The lag that margin covers was
  measured on Linux; macOS's stamping lag behind `CLOCK_REALTIME` is INFERRED, and one over 10 ms
  lets a change made just after the fence read as made before it. The evidence is green CI runs
  alone (the on-disk fence case on `macOS-clang-release`), an absence of an observed failure, not
  a bound. [#1659](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1659).
- **The fail-CLOSED direction of the same clock limits.** A filesystem whose clock LEADS this
  machine's (an SMB or NFS share, or `/mnt/<drive>` under a WSL clock that lags the Windows
  host) stamps a fresh file at or above T0, and so does a coarse-grid filesystem (FAT, HFS+,
  ext4 with 128-byte inodes) for a file written in T0's own slot. Such an input reads as moved,
  so `INPUTS-MOVED` RECURS for files nobody edited -- in a clean CI build whose generated
  headers live on such a share, on every run. It never serves a wrong object, but the
  statistics row's "the next build caches as usual" is false there: what to check is the
  share's clock against this machine's, or whether the filesystem stamps whole seconds. No
  runtime hint names it yet.

## Accepted trade-offs

<!-- agent-tripwire: none: trades argued in place above and deliberately not rules; AGENT.md tripwires the rules they trade against -->

These are argued in place above and are **not** open work — do not "fix" one
without reopening the argument:

- **`ValidateManifest` accepts a manifest that names the TU and no header, and
  nothing but the PRODUCER stops one existing.** `ManifestAssertsNothing` is
  `entries.empty()`, and a TU-only manifest is not empty — so a hollow manifest
  reaching the validator would revalidate on the TU hash alone and serve its
  recorded object into any checkout that computes the key, which is
  [#368](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/368).
  It cannot currently be built. Three producer-side guards refuse it, and two of the
  three now live at the seam rather than one translation unit away:
  `DepsNotObserved` when no dependency record was observed at all, `NoProjectDeps`
  when paths were reported and every one dropped (`4739f54`) — both in
  `BuildManifest` — and `UnreadablePaths` in `RecordManifest` when a reported path is
  not readable as text (`47ee5e5`).
  The first of those was `RecordManifest`'s own `includes.empty()` early return until
  [#512](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/512), and moving it is
  what that issue was for. **"No dependencies" and "dependencies not observed" are
  different states that an empty `std::vector<std::string>` renders identically**, and
  `BuildManifest` used to tell them apart by inferring honesty from
  `!includePaths.empty()` — sound only because of a guard nothing in
  `DirectManifest.cpp` could see. So the FOUR states are: deps observed and some
  project ones survived (a manifest); observed, some reported, none survived
  (`NoProjectDeps`); observed and none reported (an honest TU-only manifest); and not
  observed (`DepsNotObserved`). The last two were the collapsed pair. `ManifestInputs`
  now carries a `ReportedDependencies` whose **default constructor is deleted**, so a
  new caller cannot omit the answer — designated initializers value-initialize an
  omitted member in silence, which is how a defaulted field would have made the guard
  decorative.
  The third state has **no producer**, and that is a finding rather than an oversight:
  `RecordManifest` cannot separate "there is nothing to read" from "I could not read
  it", because `IncludeNoteMarker` is the literal English `"Note: including file:"`
  and a localized `cl` prints notes it does not match
  ([#692](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/692)). It therefore
  answers `NotObserved()`. The type puts the judgement where the knowledge is.
  **So the accepted cost is the asymmetry, not a live hole**: the defence is
  entirely on the produce side, and the validator would accept a hollow manifest
  that arrived any other way — decoded from a store written by an older or foreign
  producer, for instance. Tightening `ManifestAssertsNothing` to refuse a TU-only
  manifest is the defence-in-depth fix, and it is cheap; #512 did not do it and did
  not make it unnecessary — that is a CONSUMER-side question about a manifest
  carrying no provenance, and #512 moved the PRODUCE-side one into the type. The two
  do not substitute for each other. What is NOT acceptable is
  removing any of the three producer guards on the belief that the validator would
  catch it. `DirectManifest_test.cpp`'s two cross-checkout cases characterize the
  validator's current answer and say in-place that they must change if it is
  tightened; the `Observed({})` they build is a lie the fixture tells deliberately
  and says so, since no honest caller spells that state.
- **`VSLANG=1033` on the banner probe collapses the common locale split and opens a
  rarer one, and the rarer one has no detector.** Since #195 the banner IS the
  compiler's identity, and `cl` localizes it, so one MSVC toolset under two Visual
  Studio UI languages was two identities that shared no cache entry and matched
  nothing in the fleet. Asking the probe for English
  ([#200](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/200)) collapses that
  — which is the commoner split, between whole machines, and the trade is a good one.
  **What it costs is an estate whose machines differ only in WHICH PACKS ARE
  INSTALLED**: German UI throughout, `en-US` present on some. Those machines matched
  each other before and no longer do — the one that can honour `VSLANG` derives the
  English identity and the one that cannot derives the German one. That is #200's own
  symptom, newly introduced for exactly that shape of estate.
  **And there is no detector, nor can there cheaply be one.** The `/showIncludes` twin
  has `Cc::CarriesUnreadableIncludeNotes`, which can see that a request did not take
  because it parses the answer. A banner is one opaque line: nothing distinguishes
  "this is English" from "this is a language shaped like the last one" without a
  second probe spawn per compile to compare against. So this case is silent by
  construction, and that is the half most likely to be rediscovered as a bug and
  "fixed". It is not a bug; it is this row. The argument is on `CompilerBanner` in
  `apps/pace-cc/ToolchainProbe.cpp`, which points here.
- MurmurHash3 is not collision-resistant against an adversary. Accepted because
  the key is not a security boundary: anyone who can STORE can already write a
  wrong object under a correct key. Closing it needs a keyed hash *and* a trust
  model for STORE.
- Two machines whose compilers print the same version banner from different
  install prefixes share a key and can replay each other's toolchain paths.
  Hashing those paths would give up cross-machine sharing wholesale;
  `Cc::MissingReplayedDependency` is the backstop instead.
- The 64 MiB floor in `SessionContext` means a cap below it cannot be exercised
  end-to-end without a genuinely large fixture, so the e2e drives the client
  ceiling and `TcpClient_test` pins the socket half.
- A stored stream region mixes encodings when the compiler's is not UTF-8: the
  path spans are decoded, the text around them is the tool's own bytes. Replayed
  on a hit to a console that is not UTF-8, a non-ASCII path therefore renders
  differently than the uncached compile printed it. Accepted, because the
  alternative is the one that cannot work: an entry storing the producer's code
  page is an entry no other machine can canonicalize, which is the whole of what
  this cache is for. `chcp 65001` makes the two identical.
- **On COFF a replayed object's debug records name the producing checkout, and no
  flag closes it.** `-ffile-prefix-map` does not remap CodeView's `S_OBJNAME` or
  clang-cl's embedded `-cc1` line — measured, still 23 bytes apart with the flag —
  and `cl` has no path-map switch at all. The alternative is #489's shape, which
  gives up cross-checkout sharing on **every** `cl` compile, debug info or not,
  and that sharing is what the launcher exists to provide on that platform. So the
  residue is accepted and stated rather than closed. Coverage, which has the same
  defect, is hard-guarded (`cmake/Coverage.cmake` refuses a launcher outright);
  debug info is not, because a wrong source path in a debugger is a nuisance and a
  wrong coverage report is a lie that looks like data.

## A performance figure is a quantity under conditions, and both halves get lost separately

<!-- agent-tripwire: A performance figure is a quantity UNDER CONDITIONS, and the two halves get lost separately -->

`ProbeToolchainFiles` walks a toolchain's include roots and hashes **every byte** of
every file. Its header recorded the cost as **"about 2 s warm"** — measured
honestly, correctly attributed, with the condition attached. That figure then
appeared twice more:

- `ComputeToolchainStamp`: *"the alternative is the 2-second full walk this exists
  to avoid"*
- `CachedToolchainFingerprint`: *"The full walk costs about 2 seconds over 288 MB"*

**Both dropped the `warm`.** And the design downstream was reasoned from the
citations rather than from the measurement, so a walk that is seconds warm and was
observed exceeding **300 s** cold on a Windows runner was treated as a two-second
operation for as long as anybody remembered it.

Two separate failures, and neither is staleness — the number was never wrong.

**Attaching the conditions is necessary and not sufficient, because the citation
is where they get lost.** The original was exemplary; it did not survive being
quoted twice. So a figure that is going to be *referred to* elsewhere belongs in
**one** place that the other sites point at, rather than being restated — the same
reasoning `check-tsan-scope.cmake` follows for reading a tag expression instead of
copying it. A second copy of a measurement is not a cross-check, it is a second
thing to drift.

**And a figure can be current, correctly measured, correctly attributed, and still
be the wrong quantity.** That is a distinct failure and it deserves naming
separately. Here it was *circular*: the warm cost was quoted as the price of
**missing the cache** — but the cache is the mechanism that makes the warm case
warm. What a miss costs is by definition the cold number. Nobody was quoting a
stale figure; they were quoting the right figure for the wrong question, which no
amount of re-measuring would have caught.

The corrected form is one table at the measurement site, showing the spread rather
than a number, with the conditions as rows:

<!-- table-total: none -->
| condition | per file |
|---|---|
| warm page cache, local SSD | 0.21 ms |
| cold, local SSD, anti-malware active | **5.00 ms** |
| Linux (gcc 14), cold | 0.26 ms |

A spread also states its own uncertainty, which a single number cannot. Anyone
citing it has to pick a row, and picking a row is the moment the question "under
which conditions?" gets asked.

### The same rule governs a claim handed between people

Everything above is written about a figure in a code comment, and the mechanism has
nothing to do with code. It is a claim that was true when someone measured it,
restated once, and arriving at the next reader with its conditions stripped. A
**handoff is a citation**, and it is the citation that loses them.

It is worse than the comment case in one specific way: a reader who doubts a comment
can go and re-measure. A reader who is *handed* a claim usually cannot, because the
measurement was made somewhere they cannot see -- another session, another machine,
a run whose log has gone. What reaches them is a sentence with the same shape whether
it was measured, inferred, remembered or guessed, and nothing in that sentence
distinguishes the four.

Four in one session, all through a handoff, none of them a mistake about the subject:

- a mechanism reported by one session and published by another **as established**,
  when it was a reconstruction that the subject itself contradicted
  ([#517](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/517));
- a `36/36` correspondence **verified by hand** and relayed as though a guard
  enforced it;
- a **pull request number** that was an issue number, handed over as checkable;
- *"thirty lines up"*, written in a comment that quoted **both line numbers** and
  never subtracted them -- the real distances being 117 and 212
  ([#172](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/172)).

That last one shows the correction usually strengthens the point rather than denting
it. *Thirty lines* invites "somebody glanced past the helper"; **117 and 212** means a
reader can arrive at either call site having never seen the helper at all, which is a
better account of how a rule fails to travel and a worse one for anybody arguing that
proximity is sufficient.

**The remedy is on the sending end, because only the sending end can do it: say what
was MEASURED and what was INFERRED, separately, every time.** The receiver cannot
recover the distinction at any price, and the sender can state it for free. A claim
worth acting on is worth one clause saying which of the two it is.

**And the receiver owes one thing back, because the sender's half does not always get
done: state what would FALSIFY the claim before opening the file to check it.** Not
*distrust the sender* -- that does not scale, and a rule nobody can follow is not a
rule -- but derive the falsifier from the claim itself, first, so that the reading has
somewhere to go other than the line that agrees.

Two errors an hour apart made the same claim about the same function, and **the
standard remedy for the first is the action that produced the second**
([#536](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/536)). One reader
inferred `RunLaunchctl`'s implementation from its caller's error message and reported a
defect; the fix for that is *go and read the source*. The second reader **read the
source** and wrote the defect down anyway.

So "read the source" cannot be the lesson here: it is the step that was taken. The
first error is cheap and self-correcting -- reading catches it, and reading is what
eventually did. The second is expensive and **not** self-correcting, because the
corrective action has already been performed and produces the feeling of having
checked.

What separated them was the ORDER of question and evidence. The second reader arrived
holding a hypothesis handed over by the first -- *a stale constant standing in for a
measurement*, the `waited += poll` silhouette this rulebook already records -- and the
line

```cpp
return std::format("killed after {}s with no result", LaunchctlTimeoutSeconds);
```

matches that silhouette exactly. It takes reading the **loop** to see that a
`steady_clock` deadline with a 20 ms poll and a `SIGKILL` at expiry makes `60s` the
measurement, to within about 20 ms.

**Confirmation stops at the format string; falsification has to reach the loop.**
Reading for confirmation terminates at the first line that matches the shape, and a
match is close to guaranteed when the shape was supplied by somebody who had also not
read it. The falsifier here is one question -- *what would make the printed number
differ from the elapsed?* -- and it walks straight past the format string into the
loop, which is the only place the answer lives. Without it, *"I read the code"* is
compatible with having read exactly the line that agreed.

That is the second-order half of the handoff rule rather than a separate idea: a
handed-over shape **carries no evidence and arrives already sounding checked**, having
been stated as a finding rather than as a suspicion, which is a defect in the handover
before it is one in the reading. Stated compactly, **a relayed diagnosis is relayed
code** -- forwarding a shape propagates its bugs, and reviewing it as though you had
written it yourself is the only reading that catches them.

It is not the *absence of the negative is not the positive* rule in
[`.agent/rules/metrics-and-observability.md`](metrics-and-observability.md), which
covers concluding from a COUNT OF BAD THINGS. This is the opposite direction:
concluding from a **presence** that matches an expected shape. The positive-control
remedy there -- ask the probe for something it must find -- is the same instinct in its
running-a-check form, and this is its form for reading code.

**And where a question can be settled by ATTEMPTING THE ACTION rather than by reading
the state and reporting it, attempt it:** a claim freezes the read permanently, carries
no timestamp and cannot be refused by anything downstream, whereas a request against the
live system -- `gh pr merge --auto`, a write that can conflict, a `cancel` -- is refused
with current truth at the moment the staleness would otherwise have done harm.

### And the never-restate rule does NOT reach a measurement's CONDITIONS -- pin those

**The test is whether the two copies are supposed to stay EQUAL.**

A *live* figure -- a rate, a count, a required-context set -- has two copies meant to
agree, so they drift while both go on claiming to be current. One copy; everyone points
at it. That is the rule the section above makes.

A *measurement's conditions* are the state of the world at one INSTANT and must **NOT**
track their source. They are restated deliberately, and marked as of the measurement.

Measured 2026-09-09 ([#1151](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1151)):
a registration comment recorded a hosted scan at **2.11 s** under `four cores at
CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL: 4`. The tidy that suggests itself is to delete the numbers and
point at `build.yml`. Do that, and the day somebody sets four to eight the 2.11 s figure
**silently claims it was measured at eight** -- a false condition welded to a real
measurement by an unrelated edit, with no signal, and worse than the stale constant it
replaces, which at least misstates only itself.

**The corrected comment LOOKS like the defect.** It restates a number from a file it
cites, which is exactly the shape the never-restate rule catches -- so it must say why it
is pinned, or the next cleanup reverses it.

Two people applied the never-restate rule correctly here and got the wrong answer. And
the original error, `two-core` against a workflow saying four, was **not drift at all**:
it was a value wrong when typed, against a file its author had not opened. No link and no
guard catches that one. Only reading the source you cite does.

## Prefer not needing the cache at all

<!-- agent-tripwire: Computing a value once and returning what you already have beats caching it -->

Computing a value once and returning what you already have beats caching it.

`CachedToolchainFingerprint` derived the resolved path, the include roots and the stamp,
returned **none of them**, and its caller re-derived all three at an extra driver spawn
per toolchain per survey -- on warm starts too, because a cache HIT said nothing about
the roots it covered. That was not a caching problem, and a cache would have been the
wrong fix for it. The fix was `ToolchainIdentity` handing back the `ToolchainEvidence` it
had already folded ([#259](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/259)).

**A wider return value is the STRONGER answer, not merely the cheaper one.** Two
derivations a few milliseconds apart can disagree, and the caller was recording evidence
that a compiler upgrade in between would have made describe a different include tree than
the digest covers. Returning what was already folded makes that disagreement
unrepresentable; a cache only makes it rarer.

**Evidence a caller may not have is a disengaged `optional`, never an empty field.**
Empty roots and an empty stamp are both ordinary answers, so neither can carry *there was
no probe* -- which is the `exitCode == NotSpawned` guard from
[`distributed-compilation.md`](distributed-compilation.md) moved out of the call site and
into the type.

### And where a cache IS needed, decide SAFETY first -- it decides whether to cache at all

An answer that costs a spawn, a syscall or a walk, and is asked for more than once, is
cached -- **but only where staleness degrades safely.** That second clause is the whole
rule. Without it the principle is a licence to serve wrong answers quickly, and the
expensive probes are exactly the ones somebody will reach for it to justify.

So the safety question is asked FIRST, before the cost question, because it decides
whether there is a cache at all rather than how long its interval is. There are two
shapes and they are not a spectrum:

- **Staleness that costs a refusal, a miss or a retry is safe to cache.** The
  local-address set behind the node's cache gate is this shape: an address just gained
  is refused for at most one interval, which fails **closed**, self-heals, and costs one
  local compile. That design, with both staleness directions named in the header and the
  probe counted rather than clocked, is derived in
  [`distributed-compilation.md`](distributed-compilation.md) under *a node's cache tier
  serves THIS MACHINE* -- along with the rest of the checklist a safe cache still owes:
  **measure before choosing, on every platform** (`GetAdaptersAddresses` against
  `getifaddrs`, two orders of magnitude apart, so a design that is free on the platform
  you develop on can dominate a request on the one you ship to); **fast by construction
  before fast by cache** (`IsLoopbackHost` first and lock-free, so the cache bounds only
  the rare path -- a far weaker thing to get right); **refresh on an INTERVAL or on a HOST
  EVENT (a network change, a wake), never on a miss** (a miss-triggered refresh hands a
  remote peer a free amplifier: one expensive probe per request, just by asking; a host
  event is neither a miss nor something a peer can provoke, so it adds no amplifier, and
  without it a VPN re-address keeps a stale answer for a whole interval -- W-7,
  `LocalityExpiryFor`); and **an injected seam with an injected clock**,
  because a cache with a hidden clock is untestable by construction.
  The node's unreachable-UPSTREAM memo is the same shape (`UpstreamReachability`,
  `RemoteUpstream.hpp`): a stale *unreachable* ignores a returned shared cache for at most one
  retry interval, which is a local compile; a stale *reachable* costs the one exchange that
  discovers the outage, which every miss paid before. What it remembers is whether the EXCHANGE
  completed -- a dial that did not connect and a connection that stalled or lost its peer are one
  answer, the second the costlier -- and never a miss. Its next probe is stamped when GRANTED, not
  when it fails: a probe suspends for up to its ceiling, and every miss arriving meanwhile would
  otherwise try too.
- **Staleness that produces a wrong answer which LOOKS right is not cacheable**, however
  expensive the probe. `DiscoverTargetTriple` is the instance, above: ~40 ms per
  translation unit and deliberately not memoized, because the triple reaches `compilerId`
  and a stale one is a wrong hit rather than a miss
  ([#188](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/188)).

**Expense is not the criterion; what a stale answer DOES is.** The two shapes are told
apart by asking what the caller sees when the answer is one interval old -- not by asking
how much the probe cost, which is the question that is already in the reader's head and
which is uncorrelated with the answer. A wrong hit and a miss are not degrees of the same
failure: one is recoverable by retrying and the other is a build that links an object
nobody can account for.

## Open work

<!-- agent-tripwire: none: deferred work, tracked as GitHub issues; AGENT.md tripwires rules, not residuals -->

- **[#1653](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1653)** — a header
  replaced during the key's preprocess by a copy that keeps an older change time is not seen by
  the input witness. On NTFS `CopyFileW` copies the SOURCE's change time onto the destination
  (measured on two volumes while implementing #1650), so such a header reads as older than T0
  and the T0 clock rule passes it, and no earlier snapshot of it exists, because the header set
  is unknown until the preprocess runs. A copy after T1′ changes a snapshotted header's identity
  and is caught, so for those the window is the preprocess; a path named only by the build's own
  `-MF` has no T1′ identity and is judged by the clock alone, so for it the window runs
  until its manifest entry is hashed (after the STORE on a miss; at the backfill on a hit).
  Not reproduced end to end: derived from the measurement and the witness's construction. See *The key, the object and the manifest describe ONE moment*.

- **[#1654](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1654)** — a header CREATED
  at any point of the invocation, the compile included, in an include directory searched EARLIER than the one the key's preprocess
  resolved, is in no input witness: the witness snapshots what the preprocess REPORTED, so a
  compile that reads the new header stores its object under a key taken from the shadowed one.
  ccache has the same gap. Not reproduced: derived from the witness's construction (#1650's
  design, Known limits).

- **[#1659](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1659)** — the input fence's
  10 ms margin on a platform with no coarse clock (macOS in practice) is inferred, not measured,
  and fails OPEN beyond it. `FineClockSafetyTick` covers about two ticks at 200 Hz -- the
  coarse-clock lag measured on the Linux timekeeper (7.45 ms on WSL's 4 ms tick) -- but on macOS,
  the one platform where the margin decides correctness, the stamping lag behind
  `CLOCK_REALTIME` was never measured; a lag over 10 ms there lets a change made just after the
  fence read as made before it. Evidence so far is green CI runs of the on-disk fence case on
  `macOS-clang-release`, which bound nothing. See *The key, the object and the manifest describe
  ONE moment*, Known limits.

- **[#1567](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1567)** — `## The digest` has no `AGENT.md`
  tripwire, so the object key being MurmurHash3 x64_128 rather than four CRC32C lanes
  — the 32-bit key that served an unrelated TU's object under a zero exit code —
  fires in no session that does not open this file. Its marker says `untriaged:` and
  not `none:`, because `none` would claim the section needs no tripwire; `ctest -R
  rulebook-tripwires` prints the count against this issue on every run. Three sections
  here are tripwired for ONE HALF of what they state — `VSLANG` on the probe spawn
  only, `CmdLine::PathValueFlags()`, and the drained over-cap frame — which the
  guard passes correctly, since its stated blind spot is that it does not judge
  whether a phrase is the RIGHT tripwire. The issue lists them.

- **[#1568](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1568)** — a
  `GenerationBump`'s `changedRows` cannot name the behavioural subset of a bump, and the
  first real bump is where that became visible. `AppendCoveredStages` digests
  `trace.storedBytes`, whose LEADING BYTE is `CompileValueVersion`, so every row the two
  generations share moves on every bump **by construction** — the 4-to-5 row therefore
  lists all 21, which is honest and says nothing. The per-row table still earns its keep
  for a change WITHIN a generation, which is the case it fires on; what is broken is only
  the claim ACROSS one. Recorded rather than hand-pruned: a pruned list would be a second
  source of truth that nothing checks, and the guard would still pass.
  **It has a deadline, which is why it is here rather than in a comment.** Repairing it
  means re-deriving `Generation4Rows` under a material layout that excludes the version
  byte, and that can only be done while generation 4 is still the one this build
  implements. Once generation 5 ships, gen 4's rows are a DATED RECORD that no tree can
  reproduce — the same reason generations 1 to 3 keep only an aggregate digest.

- **[#878](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/878)** — **the
  mechanism now exists and its localized leg is still unexercised, which is what keeps
  this entry open.** `Cc::ResolveIncludeNoteMarker` asks `MarkerSource`'s rows in
  enumerator order, which IS the precedence —
  operator, then a probe that ASKS the compiler, then the English default. Three sources
  but **FOUR** provenances, because *asked and declined* and *never asked* carry the same
  marker and differ only in the remedy: telling an operator to set
  `PACE_MSVC_DEPS_PREFIX` is advice already taken by whoever wrote `auto`, so
  collapsing the pair gives the one operator who opted in a confident wrong answer.
  `MarkerSource::DiscoveryDeclined` is that fourth state, and a `static_assert` holds its
  label distinct from `Default`'s — the two are equal in every other observable, so a
  copy-paste between them passes every test. And
  `Cc::ProbeIncludeNoteMarker` writes a one-header translation unit, preprocesses it
  with `/EP /showIncludes` **in the build's own environment**, and reads the prefix off
  the line ending in the header it just wrote. Four things about it are worth carrying
  here rather than leaving in the header:
    - **The probe must NOT be anglicized.** `RunCaptureSplitInEnglish` forces `VSLANG=1033`
      on every spawn whose output only this launcher reads, and that is right for all of
      them and exactly wrong for this one: the question is what the BUILD's own compiles
      emit, and those run in the ordinary environment. A probe that anglicized itself
      would answer English on every machine and report it with confidence — a confident
      wrong signal, and the one this ticket exists to remove.
    - **The answer is not cached anywhere, and THAT is why the probe is OPT-IN.** Installing
      a language pack moves the prefix without moving anything a cache stamp covers, so a
      remembered answer goes stale in the direction that produces a wrong result that looks
      right — `DiscoverTargetTriple`'s argument, one field over. But a launcher process
      serves ONE translation unit and `/showIncludes` sits on every compile line under
      CMake + Ninja + MSVC, so *probe whenever nobody named a prefix* is a second compiler
      spawn per FILE, paid on CACHE HITS too — where not running a compiler is the entire
      value of the hit — to rediscover the English default on almost every machine. **A cost
      that cannot be amortised cannot be a default.** So the operator asks, with
      `PACE_MSVC_DEPS_PREFIX=auto` (`Cc::MarkerDiscoveryRequest`, read by the RESOLVER
      so the one value that means *ask, do not tell* has one reading), and `WantsMarkerProbe`
      adds only the three facts the resolver cannot know: a parsed compile, `/showIncludes`
      in play, and an MSVC-family driver read off `DriverSpec::family` rather than by naming
      the flavors.
    - **A wrong prefix is worse than no prefix**, so the parser refuses rather than
      guesses: a candidate line with blanks in front of the prefix is refused (the #1270
      anchor, on the writing side), a bare path line teaches nothing, and two candidate
      lines suggesting two different prefixes teach nothing at all — the `#pragma message`
      hazard below is exactly what that last clause is for.
    - **The probe matches a UTF-8 path against bytes the compiler wrote in the CONSOLE
      CODE PAGE, and that is a KNOWN GAP rather than an oversight.** A `char` is UTF-8 in
      this tree, so `files->header.string()` is UTF-8; `cl` writes `/showIncludes` in the
      console code page, which is the reason `RootReconciler::Path` exists at all. So a
      `%TEMP%` carrying one non-ASCII byte — a German user name, which is **the population
      this ticket is for** — makes the suffix test miss and the probe silently learns
      nothing. It fails OPEN, to English, reported as `DiscoveryDeclined` rather than as
      the default, so the operator at least sees that the ask happened; a wrong prefix is
      never produced. It is not fixed here because the marker must STAY in the compiler's
      encoding — it is later matched against raw `run->out` — so the repair needs a
      UTF-8 → tool-code-page direction that `Core/NarrowText.hpp` does not have, which is
      a change to a `Platform/` seam rather than to the launcher. **Whoever runs the
      localized leg must rule this out FIRST**, because it and a genuinely unlocalized
      toolchain produce the identical observation: a probe that answered nothing.

  **What is left is the leg no machine here can run.** Split from #700 on exercisability
  rather than cost: discovery's input is the compiler's output language, so an English
  `cl` discovers English and proves nothing, and a stub asserts its own premise. Two
  driver behaviours a stub cannot settle — `cl` indents nested notes, and a localized
  DIAGNOSTIC can also end in a known dependency path.
  **The "we do not have the machine" half is now MEASURED rather than assumed**, which
  the ticket's own acceptance names as a legitimate finding. Measured 2026-09-11 on
  Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26200, Visual Studio 18 Community: both installed toolsets
  (14.44.35207 and 14.51.36231) carry exactly ONE resource directory, `1033`, and
  `VSLANG` at 1033/1031/1041/2052 gives byte-identical English from both the banner and
  the note prefix, on both toolsets. **`VSLANG` selects among INSTALLED language packs
  and cannot conjure one**, so it cannot be run backwards to synthesise the case: a
  localized `cl` is an INSTALLER choice, not an environment variable. Whoever picks this
  up needs a host with a non-English pack installed, and no arrangement of this one will
  substitute. **RE-DERIVED 2026-09-19 on the same host, independently and before the
  mechanism above was built** — same two resource directories, same four `VSLANG`
  values, same byte-identical English. That is recorded because the date is the claim: a
  premise about an INSTALLATION is one an installer can change under you, and this one
  is the premise the whole entry rests on.
  Both hazards were then measured anyway, because neither is localization-dependent and
  a stub was never needed for either.
  **The indent is AFTER the marker, not before it.** Measured on both toolsets at depths
  1 to 6: the marker sits at column zero every time and `cl` pads between it and the
  path by one blank per level of inclusion depth. The ticket's shape
  `<marker><indent><path>` is exactly right and so is its consequence — a derivation of
  *line minus the known path* learns `Note: including file:` plus a DEPTH-DEPENDENT run
  of blanks, so the prefix it discovers depends on which note it happened to learn from.
  A discovery must therefore trim trailing blanks from what it learns, and
  `IncludeNoteMarker` is spelled without a trailing space for the matching reason.
  **A line ending in a known path needs no localization to exist.**
  `#pragma message("see C:\ci\deep\src\a.h")` emits exactly `see C:\ci\deep\src\a.h` on
  the same stream — a line ending in a real dependency-shaped path, carrying no marker
  at all, from which a *line ending in a known path* heuristic learns the prefix
  `see `. Measured on an English `cl`. What that settles is narrower than it looks and
  the narrow reading is the useful one: the hazard is real for a discovery run over the
  USER's compile output and absent for one run over a probe TU the launcher wrote
  itself, so it is a design constraint on the fix rather than an argument against it.

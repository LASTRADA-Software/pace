# Packaging (CPack)

# Generators:
#   - Windows: WIX (MSI) — installs pace-kv.exe + pace-cc.exe and
#              registers pace-kv as an auto-start service
#   - Linux  : TGZ + DEB + RPM — installs both binaries plus the systemd units
#   - macOS  : TGZ + productbuild (.pkg) — installs both binaries under
#              /opt/fastcached, puts them on PATH, and offers the launchd
#              registration as installer choices
#
# The service-integration assets themselves (units, sysusers.d, tmpfiles.d, the
# example config, the launchd installer scripts, the WiX fragment) live under
# packaging/ and are installed by packaging/CMakeLists.txt, which exports the
# variables consumed below. This file only describes how the generators wrap
# what is already installed.
#
# Linux and macOS ship a single Runtime payload; Windows ships one component
# per application, the MSI's features. The Pace/CowTree static libraries
# are deliberately not installed (see the comment in the top-level
# CMakeLists.txt), so there is no SDK component to separate out.
# macOS additionally splits the two launchd registrations into their own
# components, because CPack maps one component to one installer choice and the
# two are alternatives rather than both-or-neither.

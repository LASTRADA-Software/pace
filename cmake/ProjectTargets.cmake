# ProjectTargets.cmake - what this project actually built, derived from the build
# system rather than listed by hand.
#
# Three callers want the same answer and for the same reason. The `coverage`
# target hands llvm-cov every binary the suite runs, cmake/Utf8CodePage.cmake
# attaches the UTF-8 manifest to every binary that parses a command line, and
# cmake/ErrorPopups.cmake attaches the Windows error-popup suppression. All
# fail SILENTLY when the list is wrong -- a report of one fewer file still renders,
# and an executable that missed the manifest still runs -- so neither may be
# maintained by hand, and neither may keep a private copy of the walk that would
# drift from the other.

# Collect the executable targets defined under src/, or under the source-relative
# roots named after OUT_VAR.
#
# The roots are a parameter because the error-popup suppression must reach
# `vendor/`, where upstream's own test binary is defined and run by ctest, while
# coverage and the code page have no reason to (#1389). The root `*` names the whole
# source tree, which is what a check of that walk must enumerate: a census taken
# through the walk's own filter cannot see what the filter left out.
#
# A new app under src/apps/ is a new row in that directory's app table and nothing
# else, so nothing here needs editing when one appears.
#
# The subdirectory walk is filtered to src/ because CPM adds each dependency's
# source tree as a subdirectory too, and those carry executables (Catch2's own
# self-tests, for one) that neither caller wants. Compared with string(FIND)
# rather than a regex: a checkout path is arbitrary text, and this repository
# routinely has worktrees with a `+` in the name.
#
# Reads the build system as it stands, so every caller must run AFTER the
# add_subdirectory() calls that define the targets.

# CPACK_POST_BUILD_SCRIPTS hook: notarize the .pkg, then wrap it in a .dmg and
# notarize that too.
#
# Runs after the packages exist, with CPACK_PACKAGE_FILES holding their absolute
# paths. Runs as a `cmake -P` script, so only CPACK_-prefixed variables are
# visible.
#
# Order is deliberate and not interchangeable: the .pkg is stapled *before* it
# is wrapped. A notarization ticket stapled to the outer disk image does not
# travel with a .pkg that the user drags out of it, so an offline install of the
# extracted package would fall back to an online Gatekeeper check — exactly the
# "Apple could not verify..." dialog this whole pipeline exists to avoid.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Submit @artifact to Apple, wait for the verdict, then staple the ticket.
# Script mode sets no policies, so every policy-gated construct in this file
# would mean different things depending on which CMake ran it -- `if(x IN_LIST y)`
# errors out on 3.28 and answers on 4.x. CPack runs this hook the same way ctest
# runs a `cmake -P` check, so the same declaration applies, and #680 put it inside
# `script-check-signals`'s pass 3 rather than leaving it to be remembered.

#
# Three separate audiences read this and they were previously served by one
# `message(FATAL_ERROR)` each:
#
#   * whoever is reading the step's log, at the point it happens;
#   * the JOB, which has to decide whether this is fatal HERE -- an artefact that
#     ships is a different question from one that never leaves the runner;
#   * the annotation on the job summary, which is the only line most people see,
#     and which said `Process completed with exit code 1` while the last words in
#     the log were `CPack Error: Cannot initialize the generator TGZ` -- a
#     consequence of aborting this hook, and a sentence about a tar generator for
#     a failure that was Apple's notary service not answering.
#
# So a verdict is RECORDED as well as reported, one line per artefact, and the
# job classifies from the record. That record is also what makes the ordering
# readable at all: `message(STATUS)` goes to stdout and `message(WARNING)` to
# stderr, CMake block-buffers the first, and the two arrive interleaved -- in the
# run that produced #1156 the log shows `attempt 2/2` starting AFTER the fatal
# error that ended the script. The record is written in the order things
# happened.

    # Bounded. An unbounded `--wait` does not avoid an ending, it hands the ending
    # to the runner, which answers after the step budget with "The action 'Package'
    # has timed out" and no statement of which operation did not finish (#376).
    # That is the rule this file's own `hdiutil` block a few lines down already
    # applied; the call sitting next to it did not get it.
    #
    # ## What the number is a bound ON, and why a longer one is not simply better
    #
    # 600 s is **not** a bound on how long Apple may take -- nothing here can know
    # that. It is a bound on **how long this job holds a runner for a third party
    # before it says so**. Three things push back on raising it:
    #
    #   * the step must still be able to REPORT. Every call in this file is bounded
    #     and names itself, and `timeout-minutes` in the packaging job is set from
    #     their SUM. Raise one of them and that sum has to move with it, or the
    #     runner writes the ending and names no operation, which is #376 again;
    #   * this bound is what separates *Apple is slow* from *the submission is
    #     wedged*. One large enough never to fire retires that distinction, which is
    #     the same objection `.agent/rules/testing.md` records against a budget that
    #     has been widened twice;
    #   * a stalled submission is not LOST. The artefact is uploaded and Apple
    #     finishes it in its own time, so the cheap remedy for a tag is to re-run
    #     the job, which usually meets an answer that is already waiting.
    #
    # ## The budget is per ARTEFACT and spent ACROSS attempts (#1156)
    #
    # It used to be per ATTEMPT, so two attempts meant 1200 s per artefact and 2400 s
    # across the .pkg and the .dmg -- against a 30-minute step budget whose comment
    # claimed the worst case fitted. It did not; the arithmetic had counted one call.
    #
    # Worse, the second attempt cannot help with the failure that produced it.
    # `notarytool submit` UPLOADS and ENQUEUES a new submission: if Apple's queue was
    # too slow to answer in the budget, a fresh submission joins the back of that same
    # queue with less time than the first one had. Measured on the run that filed
    # #1156: attempt 1 timed out at 600 s and attempt 2 timed out at 600 s, twenty
    # minutes spent to be told the same thing twice.
    #
    # A retry only helps a failure that returns QUICKLY -- a dropped upload, a
    # transient auth error -- and those leave budget behind by construction. So one
    # number expresses both rules and no branch is needed: **retry a fast failure,
    # never a slow one.** A stall consumes the budget and there is nothing left to
    # retry with.
    #
    # **A REJECTION is not retried either.** Apple answering "Invalid" is a verdict,
    # and retrying a verdict just spends the budget to be told the same thing. `_rc`
    # separates them: non-zero means no answer arrived, zero means one did and
    # `status` decides it.
    #
    # `xcrun` EXECs the tool rather than forking it -- measured on the runner,
    # `macos-15`/Xcode 26.3.0, same pid for `xcrun` and its target -- so
    # `execute_process`'s child IS `notarytool` and a TIMEOUT ends the real work
    # rather than a wrapper. That mattered: `execute_process` waits for stdout EOF
    # and not for the child to exit, so had `xcrun` forked and exited, a TIMEOUT
    # would have left `notarytool` running and reported a SUCCESSFUL submission as
    # a timeout. **That measurement is of this image**; if this job moves to

# CPM.cmake bootstrap — downloads CPM.cmake on first use, caches it.
# https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake

# Bound the download below, and every `git clone` CPM performs after it, so a
# stalled one ends instead of hanging forever (#526). The measurements and the
# reasoning for the numbers are in FetchTransferBound.cmake and nowhere else.
#
# Included FIRST, and that ordering is load-bearing twice over: the git half
# works by exporting environment variables that later subprocesses inherit, and
# the `file(DOWNLOAD)` half reads a variable it defines. This file is where
# every DEPENDENCY fetch is reached from -- it is included before any
# `CPMAddPackage`, so a dependency added later cannot be added unbounded.
# `ctest -R fetch-transfer-bound` asserts that ordering rather than trusting
# this sentence.

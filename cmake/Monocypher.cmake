# Monocypher.cmake - the vendored Monocypher, built as a C++ static library (#178).
#
# `vendor/monocypher/` is a VERBATIM copy of the Monocypher 4.0.3 release (vendor/VENDOR.md),
# so nothing that states how it is built may live inside it: a CMakeLists.txt there would be
# a file upstream does not have, and a local change on the day of the import. This file is
# OURS, and it is the whole of the build glue.
#
# ## Why C++, in a project that declares `LANGUAGES CXX` only
#
# Monocypher is C99, and it also compiles as C++ by design: upstream's README says so and
# ships the switch this file sets. Enabling C for two translation units would put a second
# language's toolchain detection, flags and compiler-cache wiring into every configure,
# including `cmake/portable/CompileCache.cmake`, which asks `ENABLED_LANGUAGES` before it
# checks a flag precisely because a language nobody enabled is a hard error there. Measured
# before this file was written: both sources compile as C++23 with ZERO warnings under g++
# and clang++-22 at `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`. MSVC was not measured here; the Windows CI
# legs are what say.
#
# `MONOCYPHER_CPP_NAMESPACE` is upstream's documented switch for exactly this build ("allows
# C++ users who compile Monocypher as C++ to wrap it in a namespace"). Without it the header
# assumes the library was compiled as C and wraps its declarations in `extern "C"`, which
# still links, but leaves `crypto_*` as C symbols in the global namespace where any other
# copy of Monocypher -- or libsodium, which uses the same prefix -- collides with them at
# link time. PUBLIC, because a consumer must spell the same namespace the objects carry.
#
# ## Why here, and what the ordering buys
#
# Included from the top-level CMakeLists.txt BEFORE `include(PedanticCompiler)` and
# `include(ClangTidy)`, which install -Werror, -Wconversion and CMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY
# directory-wide and must not reach code that is not ours to fix -- the mechanism yaml-cpp,
# Catch2 and core-cpp already rely on. The target also clears `CXX_CLANG_TIDY`
# itself, because an operator's `-DCMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY=` on the command line is a cache
# entry that exists before this file runs.
#
# The sanitizers are the opposite case: they must reach this code, and being declared before
# `include(Sanitizers)` is exactly what keeps them off it. So the top-level CMakeLists.txt
# applies them target by target after the includes, to the targets this file names in
# `PACE_MONOCYPHER_TARGETS`, beside core-cpp's. `ctest -R vendor-sanitized` reads the
# result in the objects.
#
# NOT gated on any option: this is what every node's identity will be signed with (#178), so
# there is no build of this project that can go without it.
#
# ## Dependency-free, and it must stay so
#
# It depends on nothing -- not Pace, not the standard library beyond `<stddef.h>` and
# `<stdint.h>`. That is what lets `pace-cc`'s `_fc_cc_core`, which deliberately does not
# link Pace, link this later to verify a signed lease. The ONLY first-party code allowed
# to include a Monocypher header is `src/Pace/Core/{Ed25519,X25519,Hkdf}.cpp`
# (`ctest -R crypto-seam`); everything else reaches the primitives through those.

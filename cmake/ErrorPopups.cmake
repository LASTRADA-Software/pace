# ErrorPopups.cmake - no executable a test runs raises a modal error dialog on Windows
# (#1389).
#
# A failed `assert()`, a `_CrtDbgReport` or an iterator-debug check in a Debug CRT opens
# an "Abort/Retry/Ignore" box, and a fault opens Windows Error Reporting's. Neither fails
# a test: the process waits for a click, so ctest reports a TIMEOUT on a developer's
# desktop and a runner reports a slow job. An `endo` test hung 58 minutes that way.
#
# `src/tests/WindowsErrorPopups.hpp` already knew how to switch both off; what it could
# not do was reach a `main` it did not own. Four test executables link
# `Catch2::Catch2WithMain`, so the suppression was in every `main` this project wrote and
# in none of theirs. So this attaches `src/tests/ErrorPopupsAtStartup.cpp` to every
# executable by walking the build system, the argument cmake/Utf8CodePage.cmake makes for
# the UTF-8 manifest: a target that missed a line still builds and still runs, and is
# wrong only on the run that hangs.
#
# ## Two policies, and the environment variable that joins them
#
# A TEST executable suppresses always. A PRODUCT binary -- the target named for its own
# `src/apps/<name>` directory, or one carrying `FASTCACHED_ERROR_POPUPS_POLICY on-request`
# -- suppresses only when `FASTCACHED_ERROR_DIALOG_VARIABLE` is present in its environment.
# A developer running a Debug `pace-kv` by hand keeps the dialog and the chance to attach
# a debugger at the assert; a product binary an e2e fixture spawns does not, because every
# registered test carries the variable (`_fastcached_mark_tests_for_error_dialogs` below, and
# `FASTCACHED_ERROR_DIALOG_ENVIRONMENT` on each `catch_discover_tests`) and a child inherits
# it. This is the mechanism `endo` proved; a Debug-only policy was the first draft here and
# took the debugger away from exactly the build that exists to use one.
#
# What proves all of it is not this file's claim but the generated files:
# `ctest -R error-popup-coverage` reads the link line of every executable a test launches,
# and the environment of every registered test.
#
# An executable that must NOT get the object states a reason on itself --
# `set_target_properties(<t> PROPERTIES FASTCACHED_ERROR_POPUPS "<why>")` -- which the walk
# skips and the check prints. Nothing does today.

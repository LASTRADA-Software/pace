# CPACK_PRE_BUILD_SCRIPTS hook: code-sign the staged Mach-O binaries.
#
# This runs in the one window where signing is possible at all: after CPack has
# installed the payload into its staging tree (and applied CPACK_STRIP_FILES),
# and before pkgbuild seals it. Signing earlier is pointless — `strip` rewrites
# the binary and invalidates the signature, and on arm64 an invalid signature is
# not a warning but a refusal to execute, so the package would install a daemon
# that dies with "Killed: 9".
#
# Runs as a `cmake -P` script, so only CPACK_-prefixed variables are visible.

# Script mode sets no policies, so every policy-gated construct in this file
# would mean different things depending on which CMake ran it -- `if(x IN_LIST y)`
# errors out on 3.28 and answers on 4.x. CPack runs this hook the same way ctest
# runs a `cmake -P` check, so the same declaration applies, and #680 put it inside
# `script-check-signals`'s pass 3 rather than leaving it to be remembered.

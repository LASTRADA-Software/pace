# Utf8CodePage.cmake - what encoding a `char` is on Windows.
#
# Windows keeps command lines, environment blocks and paths as UTF-16 and
# transcodes them for a narrow caller through the process's ACTIVE CODE PAGE. That
# one setting therefore decides `argv`, `getenv`, every `...A` API this tree calls
# (CreateProcessA in the launcher's process runner, CreateServiceA and
# GetModuleFileNameA in ServiceControl, RegQueryValueExA in Registry) and
# `std::filesystem::path`'s narrow conversions in BOTH directions -- MSVC's
# `__std_fs_code_page()` answers CP_ACP unless the CRT locale is UTF-8.
#
# Its default is the host's legacy code page, 1252 on a Western install. Since
# #141 the fleet refuses a registration whose fingerprint or endpoint is not valid
# UTF-8, so `--toolchain=gruen=...` spelled with a real umlaut arrived as one
# CP-1252 byte, was refused, and the node logged the refusal every heartbeat while
# never joining the fleet -- for a reason invisible from where it was typed
# (issue #155).
#
# ## Why a manifest and not a conversion at the boundary
#
# The obvious fix is GetCommandLineW + CommandLineToArgvW + WideCharToMultiByte in
# a seam every main() calls. It converts ONE boundary and leaves the rest on the
# legacy code page, which turns a wrong encoding into a SPLIT one: UTF-8 argv fed
# to `std::filesystem::path` decodes as CP-1252 and names a different file, and
# fed to CreateProcessA spawns the compiler with a mangled command line. Both work
# today. Closing that gap means policing a second convention across 45 path
# constructions, 122 `.string()` calls and six `...A` call sites, forever, with no
# compiler enforcement.
#
# Declaring the code page instead makes ONE convention true process-wide, with no
# conversion, no wide entry point, no dependency, and no call site to remember.
#
# ## The floor, and what happens below it
#
# `activeCodePage` is honoured from Windows 10 1903 / Server 2022. An older host
# ignores it in SILENCE, which is the one thing a build-time setting must not be
# allowed to be -- so `Pace::NarrowTextIsUtf8()` reports the outcome rather
# than the intent, and a Catch2 case asserts it. See
# src/Pace/Platform/NarrowText.hpp.
#
# ## What the COMPILER thinks a narrow literal is
#
# The same question, asked of the other end. Without `/utf-8`, MSVC reads a source
# file in the host's ANSI code page and re-encodes its narrow literals into that
# same page -- so a string literal holding an em dash round-trips byte-identically
# on a CP-1252 or CP-65001 host and comes out as different bytes anywhere else.
# This tree has such literals (a Redis error reply, the Windows service
# description, an SVG chart caption), and the SVG one is the sharp end: an XML
# parser refuses a document whose encoding does not hold, so a build on a host
# with a third code page would emit a chart no browser draws.
#
# Not a consequence of the manifest above -- `cl.exe` has a code page of its own
# and this changes nothing about it -- and not a hazard on any host CI or this
# project's developers use. It is here because it is the same rule: a `char` in
# this tree is UTF-8, at run time and at compile time, and a build that decides
# otherwise per host is one nothing checks.
#
# Directory-scoped and included after every CPM dependency has been added, exactly
# as PedanticCompiler and Sanitizers are, so a third-party source with a byte this
# would refuse is never handed the flag.

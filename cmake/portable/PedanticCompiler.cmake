# Fatality is decided INDEPENDENTLY of whether the pedantic warning set was

# said nothing about it: the operator asked for warnings to be fatal and got a
# build where they are not (#819).
#
# No preset reaches that combination, which is why it survived -- `base` sets
# `PEDANTIC_COMPILER=ON` and all twelve inherit it, so it is reachable only from a
# command line or a toolchain file, which is exactly where somebody debugging a
# warning would type it and where the answer they got back was silence.
#

# condition, or a build directory reused across presets holds a state no
# correction to the configure line explains (#454, #611).

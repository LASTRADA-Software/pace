# Version resolution: the git tag is the single source of truth. Cutting a
# release is `git tag -a v1.2.3 -m ...` followed by a push; nothing in the tree
# restates that number.
#
# There used to be a committed version.txt, and because it outranked every other
# source it was the *real* source of truth: a second version carrier that every
# release had to remember to bump in lock-step with the tag, and that pinned
# every build, every wire banner and every package to 0.0.1 for as long as it
# existed. It is gone, and `ctest -R repository-hygiene` fails if it is ever
# tracked again — see scripts/check-repository-hygiene.cmake. A build with no
# tag to describe (an exported source tarball, say) states its version with
# -DFASTCACHED_VERSION=1.2.3 instead.
#
# Two values come out of this and they are NOT interchangeable:
#
#   triple  strictly numeric MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, no suffix, ever. It feeds
#           project(VERSION), which rejects anything else, and
#           CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION, and from there the MSI ProductVersion
#           (major/minor < 256, patch < 65536), the RPM `Version:` field (where
#           a '-' is illegal) and the Debian version (where a '-' starts the
#           package revision).
#   string  human-facing, and carries whatever the winning source knows. A build
#           twelve commits past v0.1.0 reads 0.1.0-12-gdeadbee, with -dirty
#           appended when the tree had uncommitted changes as cmake ran. It is
#           only ever substituted into text — the memcached `version` reply, the
#           RESP INFO banner, `--version` — never into a package field.
#
# Nothing here re-runs on a new commit: the version is a configure-time
# snapshot, deliberately. A CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS on .git/HEAD would
# reconfigure the project after every commit and, because the commit distance is
# part of the string, rewrite Core/Version.hpp and recompile every translation
# unit that includes it. Release builds configure from scratch, so a shipped
# number is always current; a developer's stale banner costs nothing. Re-run
# cmake to refresh it.

# The triple a build reports when nothing available can say what it is: no tag,

# "this build does not know", sorts below every real release, and is legal in

# The ways a git query can end other than with an answer, one row each, tried IN ORDER:
#
#   <kind> | <outcome> | <match> | <what happened, for the query's own warning> | <what to do>
#
# <match> is a regular expression over execute_process's RESULT_VARIABLE: an exit status
# when git ran to completion, and CMake's own words for how it ended otherwise. Those words,
# measured on CMake 4.2 (Linux) and 4.3.1 (Windows), and on 3.28.3 (Linux) where it differs:
#
#   a timeout          "Process terminated due to timeout", on both
#   git did not start  "no such file or directory" and "permission denied" (libuv's spawn
#                      errors, on both); "unknown error" (Windows, a file that is no image).
#                      CMake 3.28.3 capitalises the first letter: "No such file or
#                      directory" (a missing file) and "Permission denied" (a file that
#                      is not executable, or a directory). MATCHES is case-sensitive, so
#                      `unrunnable` takes that letter in either case (#1642). `[Uu]` is
#                      by analogy only: "unknown error" is a Windows word, and no Windows
#                      CMake 3.28 was measured
#   git died, Linux    SIGKILL "Subprocess killed", SIGSEGV "Segmentation fault",
#                      SIGTERM "Subprocess terminated", SIGABRT "Subprocess aborted"
#   git died, Windows  0xC0000005 "Access violation", 0xC000013A "User interrupt",
#                      0xC00000FD "Stack overflow", 0xC000001D "Illegal instruction",
#                      0xC0000409 "Exit code 0xc0000409" (a code CMake has no name for)
#
# Those are every death measured, not every death there is: `died` catches the rest.
#
# `died` matches ANYTHING and is the last row, so a way of ending no row names lands there
# rather than in the nearest neighbour: before it, every non-timeout was "could not run",
# which sent the operator to GIT_EXECUTABLE for a git that had started and crashed. Its
# words quote CMake's, and a start failure it turns out to catch belongs in `unrunnable`'s
# <match>. <outcome> is what FastCachedRunGit reports: `failed` is git answering "no",
# `unanswered` is no answer at all.
#
# `@QUERY@`, `@RESULT@`, `@BOUND@` and `@GIT@` are filled in per query. A kind is a row
# rather than a branch because each needs its OWN words: a git that never started is not
# a timeout, and blaming the Windows/WSL index re-hash for a missing binary sends an
# operator to the wrong machine. Fields are separated by " | ", so a <match>'s own
# alternation is written without spaces; no row may contain a ';' (these are CMake lists).

# the string carries the commit so the build stays identifiable. Provisional, so

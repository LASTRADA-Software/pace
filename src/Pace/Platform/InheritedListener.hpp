/// It lives in `Platform/` and not in `Net/`, where it used to sit, because what
/// it integrates with is a service supervisor rather than a network: it reads the
/// process environment, checks a pid, and applies close-on-exec. It used to hand
/// back `core::net::IListener`s, which did not make it a network primitive either -- and since
/// #290 stage 3 it hands back descriptors, so it now reaches into `Net/` not at all.
/// The move was already right when the dependency existed: `Platform/` depending on
/// `Net/` is the direction that was always intended, while the reverse put `Net/`'s
/// only reach into `Platform/Environment.hpp` across the boundary `Net/` has to be
/// severable along if it is ever lifted out of this tree.
///
/// A socket-activated service does not bind its own port. The supervisor binds
/// and listens first, then starts the service only when a connection arrives, and
/// hands the already-listening descriptors over. Two things follow that are worth
/// having: the port is reachable from boot even though nothing is running yet, so
/// a client never races the daemon's startup; and an idle service costs nothing at
/// all, which is the right shape for a compile worker, since misses on a warm
/// shared cache are bursty and rare.
///
/// systemd's protocol is the one implemented here, because it is the one the
/// packaged `.socket` unit uses. launchd has an equivalent
/// (`launch_activate_socket`) and Windows has no equivalent at all; both report
/// "nothing was handed over" and the caller binds for itself, which is the same
/// path a systemd machine takes when the unit is started directly.

/// a compile worker spawns a compiler for every job -- and a child that inherited
/// `LISTEN_FDS` would believe it too was socket-activated. Clearing them once,
/// here, is what keeps that from being every spawn site's problem.
///
/// The adopted descriptors are also marked close-on-exec. systemd deliberately
/// passes them without it, so without this every compiler the worker spawns
/// inherits the listening socket -- and the port then stays held by a stray child
/// after the worker exits, so a restart cannot bind and reports "address already
/// in use" with nothing visibly holding it.
///
/// **Descriptors, not listeners, and that is what changed at #290 stage 3.** This
/// used to build a `BlockingListener` per descriptor, which was right while the
/// only thing an activated worker served was its dedicated compile port and that
/// port ran on a thread of its own. The merged `0xFC` surface runs on the reactor,
/// so the descriptor has to reach `AdoptInheritedListener` instead -- and a
/// listener built here would already OWN that descriptor, which makes handing it
/// on a double close rather than a handover.
///
/// The two timeouts went with it, and their absence is the change rather than an
/// omission. They existed because an accept loop on POSIX can only be woken by a
/// receive timeout on the listening socket: closing it does not unblock a parked
/// `accept()`, so a blocking listener without one cannot be shut down at all and
/// a `systemctl stop` hangs until the supervisor escalates to SIGKILL. On the
/// reactor `Close()` resolves a parked accept directly, so there is no such
/// listener to build here and no value to require.
///
/// **Ownership stays with the caller until it hands a descriptor to a factory
/// that takes it** -- `AdoptInheritedListener`, which owns it thereafter
/// including on its own failure paths, so a refused adoption is not a leak. A
/// caller that adopts none of them must exit, which is what the only caller does:
/// every path here that declines a handoff is a startup refusal.
///
/// @return The handed-over descriptors, in the supervisor's order, already marked
///         close-on-exec; empty when there was no handoff, which is not an error.

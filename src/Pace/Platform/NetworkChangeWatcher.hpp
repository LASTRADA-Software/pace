/// for as long as it stands still.

/// the sink ends the process. The relay does not catch it, because it has nowhere to report it
/// and swallowing it would hide a consumer's defect behind a watcher that silently goes on.
/// Destroying the relay stops its thread whatever it is waiting for and returns once a delivery in
/// flight has finished, so no delivery reaches the sink after that -- and it must therefore not be
/// destroyed from inside its own sink's `OnHostEvent`, which would join the thread it runs on.

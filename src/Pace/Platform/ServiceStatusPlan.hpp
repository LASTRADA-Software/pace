/// @file ServiceStatusPlan.hpp
/// What a Windows service host tells the service control manager, and in which order -- as data,
/// so the order is testable on every platform while `WindowsServiceHost.cpp` only walks it.
///
/// ## Why a start that is refused is its own row
///
/// The SCM waits 30 seconds for a service it started to CONNECT, and reads everything after that
/// from the states the service reports. A process that exits before connecting -- which is what a
/// startup refusal did, since every one of them returned from `main` before the host was entered --
/// is reported by the SCM as error 1053, *did not respond to the start or control request in a
/// timely fashion*: an operator running `sc start` saw a hang, and the refusal itself reached only
/// the Application log. A refused start therefore connects, and reports ONE state: stopped, with the
/// process's own exit code as the service-specific code. It never reports RUNNING first, or
/// `sc start` would answer success for a service that is already stopping.
///
/// ## Why a start that serves can wait to say RUNNING
///
/// `net start`, `Start-Service` and an installer's start action all return once the service leaves
/// START_PENDING, and read RUNNING as "it started". Reported as the body BEGINS, RUNNING said only
/// that the process was up: a node that then could not bind its port -- a cache daemon still on it,
/// after an upgrade -- refused a moment later, and every one of those callers had already answered
/// success (batch 4 review, B4-6). So a host can be told to report RUNNING when the body says it
/// SERVES instead (`ServiceReadiness::BodySignals`), with the checkpoint advancing until then, and a
/// body that returns first is reported stopped and never running.

/// Why a service host is reporting to the SCM.

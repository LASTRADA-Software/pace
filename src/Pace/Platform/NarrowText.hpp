///   legacy filename is perfectly usable, and false on a pre-1903 Windows, where
///   paths are still read through the host's legacy page.
/// - `toolCodePage` is about a **child** process. Its active code page is its own
///   manifest's business rather than ours, and `cl.exe` does not use it for output
///   anyway: it writes the paths in `/showIncludes` in the CONSOLE OUTPUT code

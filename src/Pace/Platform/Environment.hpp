/// `src/apps/pace-cc` is included in "every caller" despite not linking
/// this library: it compiles this file straight into the binary through the
/// `_fc_cc_core` list, which is how the launcher stays free of vcpkg
/// dependencies and CRT-static while still sharing the one implementation.
///
/// Anything with a decision to test reaches the environment through an injected
/// seam instead — `SystemConfigPathProbe::GetEnv` is this function wrapped in
/// one. Calling it directly is for leaf probes that have no logic worth faking:
/// `NoColorRequested` in Terminal.cpp, `MetricsPortFromEnv` in the daemon's
/// main.cpp, and the launcher's own `EnvOr` and `StateDirectory` are the whole
/// set — each a read plus a comparison.
///
/// Deliberately NOT named `GetEnvironmentVariable`: `<windows.h>` defines that
/// as a macro expanding to `GetEnvironmentVariableA`/`W`, so any translation
/// unit including both headers would fail to compile.
///
/// @param name Variable name.
/// @return The value; an empty string when the variable is set but empty; and
///         `std::nullopt` when it is not set at all. The distinction matters:
///         an unset variable means "this location does not apply", while a set
///         but empty one is a deliberate value.

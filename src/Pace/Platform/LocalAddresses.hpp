/// `IsLoopbackHost` is asked **first** and answers without touching the set or its

/// every ordinary `fastcache-cc` on this machine is answered by a string compare,
/// and the address set bounds only the rare path: a caller arriving over a widened
/// bind. A cache that only the unusual case reaches is a far weaker thing to have to
/// get right.
///
/// ## Why a stale answer is safe here, in both directions
///
/// Naming both is the point; one of them alone is how a longer interval gets talked
/// into being fine.
///
///   - **An address this machine has just GAINED is refused** until the next
///     refresh -- at most one interval. It fails *closed* and self-heals with no
///     operator action. What it costs is one local client, reaching its own node
///     over a freshly-assigned address on a widened bind, falling back to a local
///     compile: a miss and a retry, never a wrong answer.
///   - **An address this machine has just LOST is admitted** for at most one
///     interval. Exploiting it requires another machine to be handed that exact
///     address inside the window -- a DHCP reassignment racing the refresh -- and
///     the machine that gains it is on the same L2 segment the address came from.
///
/// Neither direction produces a *wrong answer that looks right*, which is the line
/// the project's caching rule draws: an answer whose staleness is served confidently
/// (a compiler's target triple, say) is not cacheable at any price, and this one is
/// not that shape.
///
/// ## Refreshed on an interval, never on a miss
///
/// A refresh triggered by an unrecognised address would hand a remote peer a free
/// amplifier: it could force the expensive probe once per request simply by asking,
/// and on Windows that probe is milliseconds. Interval-guarded, a peer sending a
/// million refusals still costs this machine one probe per interval.
///
/// ## And on a NETWORK CHANGE, which is a host event rather than a miss
///
/// The interval bounds a stale set; a host event that says an address moved ends it. A VPN that
/// re-addresses a laptop would otherwise leave the ticket audience accepting the address it lost
/// for up to one interval -- and a machine ticket minted for that address, now another machine's,
/// spendable once more here. The event only MARKS the set due: the probe still runs on the next
/// question, on the thread that asks, so the event thread returns at once (`IHostEventSink`'s
/// contract). No peer can raise a host event, so this is no amplifier.
///
/// Thread-safe. The lock is taken only past the loopback branch, so the common path
/// never contends -- which is what makes a plain mutex right here rather than a shared
/// one.
///
/// ## The refresh runs INLINE, on whatever thread asked
///
/// Stated rather than left to be discovered, because that thread is a reactor: the
/// node's cache surface answers on its event loop, so one caller in thirty seconds
/// pays the probe's ~2 ms (worst measured 5.7 ms) and every connection multiplexed
/// on that loop waits behind it, holding this lock. That is deliberate and it is
/// the reason the two numbers above are in this header at all -- a probe on a pool
/// thread would need the answer before it could decide anything, so it would be a
/// suspension in the middle of an admission check rather than a saving.
///
/// It is bounded by the interval and reached only past the loopback branch, so on
/// the default bind it never runs at all. If a future surface asks this question at
/// a rate where that stops being true, the fix is to refresh it from somewhere else
/// and publish -- not to shorten the interval.

/// it is the only place a toolchain survey and its fingerprints, a scheduler's own
/// words for refusing a registration, a failure to write fleet history, and any
/// refusal to start at all are reported. A registered service that is failing then
/// looks exactly like one that is working -- `/healthz` answers `OK` to both,
/// because it is liveness rather than correctness (#179).
///
/// The event log rather than a file, because it is what the other two supervisors
/// already have and what an operator on this platform already looks at. systemd
/// hands stderr to the journal; launchd is given `StandardErrorPath`; Windows has
/// the event log, and reaching for a file instead would have meant inventing a
/// directory, an access list on it, and a rotation policy for it -- three problems
/// this platform had already solved. `Get-WinEvent -LogName Application
/// -ProviderName <service>` is the whole retrieval story.
///
/// It also keeps the SEVERITY that a byte stream throws away: `ILogger` already
/// carries a level, and the event log is the one sink here that records it as
/// something an operator can filter on rather than as four characters inside a line.
///
/// The source must be registered for the text to render without a
/// "description not found" preamble; `InstallService` does that, and
/// `UninstallService` removes it.

///        machine are then two providers, filterable apart.
/// @param minLevel Initial filter threshold.

///         caller falls back to its console logger by asking for one and checking.

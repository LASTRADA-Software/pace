// below, one per supervisor: the SCM's calls and launchd's share no primitive, so a single
// interface would make each platform implement the other's calls as unreachable stubs. The

// over the interface and compiled on every platform (`ScmInstall`, `ScmUninstall`, `LaunchdInstall`,
// `LaunchdUninstall`), so a scripted fake drives every ending on every host. What an install

// hand each owned path over the way its privacy says (`HandOverOwnedPaths`) -- is decided there
// too, so the seam carries the calls each of those needs and no decision of its own. The real
// implementations hold the Win32 and launchd calls as they were, one per platform, and
// `InstallService`/`UninstallService` hand the platform's to the registration. There is no systemd
// half: a Linux service is a unit file the packages ship, and nothing here registers one.

/// @file LiveStream.hpp
/// Live stats as a subscription: `Op::Subscribe`, answered by a stream of `Status::Push` frames
/// (#1399). The loop both surfaces serve -- a compile node for every subject, the daemon for the
/// cache -- and the seams each of them supplies: what is captured, who is admitted, and how a
/// frame reaches the socket.
///
/// ## The shape: every subscriber PULLS, and a render is shared per tick
///
/// A subscription is a coroutine on its connection's reactor that wakes on its subject's tick
/// grid -- every floor (`CompileCacheWire::LiveSubjectTable`) -- re-gates the peer, and pushes
/// what is owed. What it pushes is read from a per-subject cache keyed on the TICK, so the first
/// subscriber to wake on a tick captures and renders and every other one on that tick shares the
/// bytes: `LiveSnapshotsRendered` rises once per subject per tick however many are watching.
///
/// **There is no queue, and that is what makes a slow subscriber free for everybody else.** A
/// subscriber whose push parks -- a watcher that stopped reading -- simply is not awake for the
/// ticks that pass meanwhile. When its write completes it wakes on the current tick, is told how
/// many cadences it missed (`PushKind::Gap`) and gets the current snapshot. Nothing is held for it
/// and nothing waits on it; memory is one cached body per subject, never one per subscriber. A
/// push that stays parked past its hold ends the connection (`IPushSink::Push`).
///
/// ## Events are diffs, not hooks
///
/// Each capture yields a `LiveEventProbe`, and consecutive probes are compared
/// (`DiffLiveEvents`). A hook at every mutation path is a silent missing event the day a path is
/// added without it -- two ends, one forgotten -- while a diff over what the tick already reads
/// cannot miss one. The cost is latency bounded by the subject's floor.
///
/// ## Re-gating is the tick's, and removal is the direction it exists for
///
/// Every tick asks the surface's gate again (`ILiveGate::Recheck`), so a peer the surface stops
/// admitting loses its stream within one floor. Admission at subscribe alone would fail OPEN on
/// removal -- the stream would outlive the decision -- and nothing would report it.

/// How one push left, as the writing surface observed it.
///
/// **A PRIVATE enum: nothing transmits it and nothing stores it, so it states no ordinals.**
///
/// Three answers rather than a bool, because the stream files two of them under different
/// counters: a push the surface gave up on is a subscriber that stopped READING, and a push the

/// Concrete `IStorageMutationObserver` that fans every storage-layer
/// mutation out to the WATCH dirty-flag registry, and publishes the
/// keyspace events no protocol handler is in a position to publish.
///
/// Installed in main.cpp by wrapping the production storage chain in a
/// `NotifyingStorage` configured with one of these observers. Because
/// the observer sits BELOW the protocol handler, EVERY protocol (Redis,
/// memcached text, memcached binary, memcached meta) and every
/// storage-internal mutation (FlushDb, TTL expiry, LRU eviction) routes
/// through the same fan-out site — closing the cross-protocol WATCH
/// bypass and the missing-FLUSHDB-event bugs without per-handler
/// duplication.
///
/// **Only two kinds publish a keyspace event here**, and the reason is worth
/// keeping in view: `RedisResp.cpp` already fires verb-specific events for
/// everything a client asked for, so a second publish would put two
/// `__keyevent@0__:*` frames on the wire per write. `Expire` and `Evict` are
/// the two nobody asked for — there is no verb executing to notice them — so
/// this is the only layer that can. `EventTable` in the .cpp is where that
/// lives; it is a row per kind, not a condition.
///
/// The observer's pointers may individually be null:
///   - A null `watches` disables WATCH dirty signalling (useful in
///     memcached-only deployments).
///   - A null `keyspace` disables keyspace publication.
///
/// `HasObservers` returns true when EITHER channel has potential
/// observers, so the storage decorator's fast-path probe is precise.

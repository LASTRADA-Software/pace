///
/// ## Why a decorator
///
/// Every frame after `ProveNode`, both ways, carries a `SealedFrameTagBytes` tag after its payload
/// under a per-direction session key (`Distributed::NodeProof`). The endpoint has five sanctioned
/// writers and one reader, and the client exchanges through `Cc::Exchange`; a seal applied at each
/// of those would be a second code path per writer, and the one that forgot would put an unsealed
/// frame on a sealed connection. So the socket seals, and nothing above it changes: a connection
/// is wrapped when it opens, passes bytes straight through until a proof engages it, and from then
/// on hands its reader only frames whose tag has verified.
///
/// ## Engaged per direction
///
/// `SealReceiving` and `SealSending` are separate because the two ends switch at different points:
/// the server engages both after it verifies the proof and then writes the `Ok` sealed, while the
/// caller must READ that `Ok` sealed although it wrote `ProveNode` in the clear. A caller therefore
/// engages receiving before it sends the proof, and sending once the `Ok` arrives.
///
/// ## What a reader is handed
///
/// Header and payload, exactly the bytes an unsealed peer would have sent -- the tag is consumed
/// here -- and nothing of a frame until the WHOLE frame has verified. A frame whose declared payload
/// exceeds `maxPayload` is a fault rather than a refusal: it cannot be verified without being held,
/// and a proven peer that sends one is not running this build's caps. A fault ends the stream: the
/// read that meets it, and every read after it, fails, and the owner closes the connection -- never
/// answers it, which is what makes an injected verb worth nothing.
///
/// ## Contracts it keeps
///
/// `Read`'s buffer must be non-empty (`core::net::contract::requireReadBuffer`, first statement). `Read` and
/// `WaitReadable` share the raw socket's one read operation, as every transport's do, and
/// `CancelRead` retires a parked read by forwarding, exactly as `TlsSocket`'s does. At most one
/// read and one write may be in flight at once, which the endpoint's one-reader and one-writer
/// rules already guarantee.

/// sit. Three things say which layer owns it, and they all say the same one: it
/// fails with `ProtocolError`, its two caps are protocol caps a session
/// configures, and its own list of callers below is the set of protocol
/// handlers. Sitting in `Net/` it was that layer's only reach back into
/// `Core/Errors/ProtocolError.hpp` -- a dependency pointing from the transport
/// at a layer above it, across the boundary `Net/` has to be severable along.
/// `Protocol/` depending on `Net/` is the direction that was always intended.

/// Buffered byte reader on top of an ISocket. Supplies both line-delimited
/// (`ReadLine`) and length-prefixed (`ReadExactly`) reads while sharing a
/// single internal buffer — so bytes that landed in the same TCP segment as
/// a header line can be consumed by the subsequent body read without an
/// extra socket round-trip.
///
/// Used by every protocol handler:
///   - memcached text: ReadLine for the command, ReadExactly for the value
///   - memcached binary: ReadExactly for the 24-byte header + extras/key/value
///   - Redis RESP: ReadLine for `*N\r\n` / `$M\r\n`, ReadExactly for bulk strings

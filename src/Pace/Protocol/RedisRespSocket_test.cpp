// RESP over a REAL reactor socket.
//
// **Why this file exists at all.** Every other RESP case in this tree runs on
// `core::net::testing::InMemorySocketPair`, whose `WaitReadable` resolves synchronously and never parks.
// The pub/sub readable watcher is built entirely around parking on that call, so the
// question it exists to answer -- who owns the socket's single read-op slot, and when
// -- is exercised by nothing. That is not a gap in the coverage of a corner: it is the
// reason [#755](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/755) and
// [#710](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/710) could both sit in
// this code behind a green suite.
//
// So these cases drive `RedisRespHandler::Run` over a socket accepted on a real
// `core::net::PlatformLoop`, with a real client on a thread of its own. That is the only
// arrangement in which the watcher parks, and therefore the only one in which dropping
// it can be observed.

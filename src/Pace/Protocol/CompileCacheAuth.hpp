/// **Four states, not a `bool`**, and the distinction that costs the most is
/// `NoPolicy` versus `Accepted`. A surface with no credential configured answers
/// `AUTH` with `Ok` -- so that turning a token on at a client is not a breaking
/// change against a server that requires none -- but it must NOT mark the
/// connection authenticated, because nothing was verified. Collapsing the two would
/// mean a later reconfiguration that enables a credential blesses every connection
/// already open on the strength of a check that never ran.
///
/// `Malformed` is separate from `Rejected` for the same reason a refusal is named
/// anywhere here: a frame this build could not parse and a secret that did not match
/// are different operator problems, and one wire code for both makes a client
/// version skew look like a wrong password.

/// writing them twice would be writing them differently
/// ([#289](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/289)). What each
/// caller still owns is how to *answer* -- the two surfaces reply through different
/// machinery -- not what is true.
///
/// An **empty username** asks to be checked against the secret alone (the redis
/// `requirepass` form), so a client configured with only a token is not locked out
/// of a server that also names a user. That is the form every in-tree client uses:
/// `Cc::Credential` is constructed `{ .username = {}, .secret = token }`.
///
/// A **machine ticket** is `NoPolicy` where no password is configured, for the reason
/// any credential is, and `Rejected` where one is: verifying a ticket needs a roster,
/// which a password policy does not have.
///
/// @param policy The surface's credential, or nullptr when it has none.
/// @param payload The `AUTH` request payload, already read and bounded by
///        `MaxAuthPayload` -- this function does no length checking, because the
///        pre-payload gate that admitted the frame already applied the ceiling.
/// @return What was established. Only `Accepted` may set a connection's flag.

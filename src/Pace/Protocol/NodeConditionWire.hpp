/// enumerator would be unrenderable by the one reader that most needs it: whoever is running the
/// older build while the newer one is rolled out.
///
/// Header-only and dependency-free for the reason `CompileCacheWire.hpp` is, which includes it:
/// `pace-cc` compiles that header in without linking `Pace`. Its own file so the leader's
/// registry can name a row without taking the whole wire vocabulary with it.

/// The `0xFC` compile-cache wire format — the single source of truth shared by
/// the daemon's handler, the `pace-cc` launcher, and the protocol test
/// client.
///
/// **This header must stay dependency-free** (the standard library plus the
/// header-only `Core/Endian.hpp`, and nothing else). `pace-cc` deliberately
/// does not link the `Pace` library — it compiles a handful of leaf sources
/// in directly so it pulls no vcpkg dependency — so an include of anything from
/// `Net/`, `Cache/`, `Async/` or `Config/` here breaks the launcher's **link**,
/// not merely its build. This is the same constraint `Cli/UsageDoc` carries, and
/// for the same reason. Being header-only is also what keeps it free: it costs no
/// row in `_pace_cc_core`.
///
/// **The module performs no I/O and holds no state.** Every function here is a
/// pure transform between bytes and structs. That is a deliberate exception to
/// the project's inject-every-dependency rule rather than an oversight: there is
/// no clock, socket, filesystem or environment behind any of it, so there is
/// nothing to inject. Reading and writing stay at the two call sites, which have
/// very different concurrency models — a coroutine reader on the server, a
/// blocking socket on the client — and share these builders and parsers verbatim.
///
/// ## Frame layout
///
/// A request is a fixed 7-byte header followed by exactly `payloadLength` bytes:
///
/// ```
/// [u8 magic=0xFC][u8 version][u8 op][u32 payloadLength]
/// payload := field*        where field := [u32 len][len bytes]
/// ```
///
/// A reply is a fixed 5-byte header followed by exactly `payloadLength` bytes,
/// **uniformly for every status** — including a miss, which carries a zero-length
/// payload rather than no payload at all:
///
/// ```
/// [u8 status][u32 payloadLength][payload]
/// ```
///
/// The declared lengths are what make the protocol extensible. A receiver that
/// does not recognise an opcode can skip exactly `payloadLength` bytes, answer
/// with a typed error, and stay in sync — so adding a verb is not a breaking
/// change, and a rejection can be a *reply* instead of a dropped connection.
/// Without them (as in the pre-1 format) the only possible response to anything
/// unrecognised was to close, which is indistinguishable from a dead peer.
///
/// All multi-byte integers are big-endian.
///
/// ## Authentication, and why it costs no round trip
///
/// When the server requires a credential, every verb whose `OpDescriptor::preAuth`
/// is false is refused with `Unauthenticated` until an `Auth` frame has been
/// accepted on that connection. That is per-connection state, and the launcher
/// opens a fresh connection *per operation* — so the obvious spelling (send AUTH,
/// await its reply, then send the real command) would double the round trips on
/// exactly the path the "no handshake" decision above exists to protect.
///
/// It does not have to be spelled that way. Replies are strictly ordered and
/// one-per-request, so a client may **pipeline**: write `AUTH` and the real
/// command in a single write, then read the two replies in order. The credential
/// costs a few dozen bytes in a segment that was going to be sent anyway, and the
/// round-trip count is unchanged. `Cc::CacheFetch`/`Cc::CacheStore` do exactly
/// this. A server must therefore never coalesce, reorder, or skip a reply — which
/// the framing already guarantees, since every request is answered exactly once.

///
/// **3 added `Status::Progress`**, the liveness pulse a worker writes while a
/// dispatched compile runs
/// ([#245](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/245)).
///
/// **4 gave the REGISTER reply a shape.** It was the worker id as bare bytes; it is
/// now a nested record carrying the id, the fleet identity and the scheduler epoch,
/// so a worker learns which fleet it serves from the one exchange it has with the
/// scheduler it was configured to reach
/// ([#401](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/401)).
///
/// **6 put the lease's lifetime on the LEASE grant.** The lifetime became a
/// replicated setting, so the number a client must bound its wait by is no longer a
/// constant both ends compile in -- it has to travel
/// ([#522](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/522)).
///
/// **7 gave the NODE-STATUS reply a runtime record**, so a node with the default
/// configuration -- no `--admin-listen`, therefore no `/metrics` and no dashboard --
/// can say what it is DOING and not only what it was configured as
/// ([#1294](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1294),
/// [#1295](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1295)).
///
/// It is one new top-level field and it is intended to be the LAST one: what it
/// carries is a nested variable-arity record, for the reason `EncodeCapacity` is
/// nested inside REGISTER. So this arity moves once, here, and every later runtime
/// fact costs no version at all.
///
/// **8 gave the CLUSTER-ADMIT reply a receipt.** It answered an empty success, so the
/// only thing an operator learned was that the message had arrived; the id and the
/// endpoint the leader wrote into the command now come back as bytes they can read
/// against the machine being admitted
/// ([#1296](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1296)).
///
/// A RECEIPT and not a confirmation, which is a constraint on the shape as much as on
/// the wording: see `ClusterAdmitReceipt`. Exact arity of two, like every other reply
/// body here.
///
/// **9 added `Status::Push` and `Op::Subscribe`**: a live-stats session subscribes on a
/// connection of its own and the node PUSHES what the dashboard draws, instead of the
/// dashboard polling `/metrics` and `/fleet.txt` over HTTP
/// ([#1399](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1399)). A reply carries a
/// status byte and no kind, and `DecodeReplyHeader` refuses a status it does not know, so a
/// new status is a new reply grammar for every reader and the floor moves with it -- the
/// version-3 argument exactly.
///
/// **Every node and every `pace-cc` upgrade together.** A launcher is a reader of this
/// wire, and a version-8 launcher is refused by a version-9 node rather than served; on this
/// project's one installation that is one rebuild of both binaries
/// ([#332](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/332)).
///
/// **10 made the NODE-METRICS reply a `StatsReading`** instead of the counter catalogue as
/// `name value` pairs, so it carries every figure `/metrics` does
/// ([#1406](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1406)). The body of an
/// existing verb changed shape, which no reader can step over: a version-9 client would read
/// the reading as malformed rows and report a node whose answer it could not read, and a
/// version-10 client would read a version-9 node's rows as a reading laid out by another build.
/// Both are wrong sentences about the right machine; `UnsupportedVersion` naming the range is
/// the right one.
///
/// **11 gave CLUSTER-ADMIT and CLUSTER-ADMIT-LEARNER a member's identity key** (#178): the
/// request carries the `@<key>` an operator typed, as a third field, and the receipt echoes
/// the key the leader RECORDED, as a third field of its own. Both arities moved, which a
/// reader cannot step over -- the request's is exact, and a version-10 client reading a
/// version-11 receipt would refuse a body with a field it never heard of, while a version-11
/// client reading a version-10 receipt would report a key nobody recorded as absent. A key
/// that reaches the leader and is dropped on the way is the worst of the three: a member
/// admitted with no key while its operator believes it has one.
///
/// **12 took the secret out of ENROLL and put identity in** (#178). The request carries the
/// joiner's ROLE and its identity KEY beside its id and endpoint, so its arity went from two to
/// four; the approved reply carries the cluster's ROSTER where it carried the cluster key; and
/// a pending row reports the joiner's role, its key and the fingerprint of the roster it was
/// last handed. A version-11 joiner would send two fields a version-12 leader refuses, and a
/// version-11 leader would hand a version-12 joiner a secret where it expects a roster -- which
/// a version-12 decoder reads as a malformed roster, but only after the secret crossed the
/// wire. Refused by version, before a byte of the request is read, is the one outcome that
/// hands nothing to anybody.
///
/// **13 made NODE-ANNOUNCE carry a voter's roster endorsement and answer with the certified
/// roster** (#178). The request gained a fourth top-level field, which the exact-arity decoder
/// cannot step over, and the reply gained a body where it had none: a version-12 node would
/// refuse every announcement a version-13 voter sends, and a version-12 worker would never
/// adopt a roster and refuse every grant once its old one lapsed -- both silently, in the
/// words of the refusal that ends it.
///
/// **14 made the node proof an IDENTITY and sealed everything after it** (#178). NODE-CHALLENGE
/// now carries the caller's nonce and ephemeral key and is answered with the server's id, key,
/// nonce, ephemeral key and a signature over all of it; PROVE-NODE carries the caller's id, key
/// and a signature where it carried a MAC under the cluster key; and every frame after an
/// accepted proof, in both directions, carries a tag under a session key only the two ends hold.
/// Three request shapes and a frame grammar moved, which no reader can step over: a version-13
/// node would refuse every version-14 challenge as malformed, and a version-14 node reading a
/// version-13 proof would be asked to verify a MAC under a key it no longer has. The four verbs
/// a joining machine sends -- `Register`, `NodeAnnounce`, `Heartbeat`, `Withdraw` -- also now
/// require that identity (`OpDescriptor::identity`), and a worker-admission verb (0x1D, since
/// retired with principal mode) and three error codes are new.
///
/// **15 is the office-fleet flag day: zero-config formation, machine tickets and signed compile
/// replies** (#178 and the formation lanes). Request arities moved -- AUTH carries its credential
/// kind (2 -> 3 fields), LEASE the workers the client could not reach and its toolchain label
/// (3 -> 5), ENROLL is signed over a challenge (4 -> 7) -- and so did replies: a LEASE grant names
/// a dial hint and the worker's identity key (4 -> 6), a COMPILE reply carries that key's
/// signature, an ENROLL reply carries the leader's challenge, key and signature, NODE-ANNOUNCE
/// carries join memos where it carried a roster endorsement and answers with nothing, the
/// NODE-STATUS runtime record holds 24 positions, its roster record closed up to three, and a
/// FLEET-SUMMARY reply holds its member list to the datagram's cap. MINT-TICKET (0x1E),
/// FLEET-SUMMARY (0x1F), SHARED-FETCH (0x20) and SHARED-STORE (0x21) are new verbs; 0x16, 0x17 and
/// 0x1D are retired; error codes 0x2C..0x33 are new and 0x28 is retired. Every one of those is a
/// shape an exact-arity decoder cannot step over in either direction: a version-14 reader would
/// refuse the new requests as malformed and read the new replies' extra fields as a peer speaking
/// nonsense, and a version-15 reader of a version-14 grant would hold no worker key and trust an
/// unsigned compile.
///
/// **16 puts a queue in front of the fleet's capacity** (#1728). ADMIT (0x22) asks the leader to
/// admit one compile and is answered `Ok` with a grant -- or `Error` -- after any number of
/// `Status::Progress` pulses, which makes it the SECOND verb a reply stream may follow; SETTLE
/// (0x23) tells the leader how that compile ended; MACHINE-BUDGET (0x24) is a node's report of its
/// own memory ledger. An older client cannot step over a pulse on a verb it does not know, which is
/// the argument that moved the floor at version 3.
inline constexpr WireVersion CurrentVersion = 16;

/// The oldest version this build still accepts. Equal to `CurrentVersion` while
/// only one version exists; widen the range when a second one ships and this

///
/// **The consequence is a flag day, and it is now written down for operators**
/// rather than left to be discovered during a rollout:
/// `docs/operations/upgrading-a-fleet.md` carries the supported stop-upgrade-start
/// procedure and the four counters a mismatch is visible on. That page is the
/// operator-facing half of what this constant decides, so a change here that opens a
/// compatibility window updates it in the same commit — a window nobody is told about
/// buys an operator nothing.
///
/// The argument below rests on #332's position that backwards compatibility is not
/// owed before the production-ready declaration. **That licence expires at the
/// declaration**, and the release that creates fleets is the release that retires the
/// premise a flag day rests on
/// ([#998](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/998)). Documenting
/// the flag day is what that ticket calls the cheapest honest option; widening the
/// range per verb — `Op::Compile` has exact arity and is the binding constraint, the
/// cache verbs are cheaper — remains open and is a decision rather than a defect.
///
/// **It moved with `CurrentVersion` for version 3, and that is the whole
/// negotiation.** `Status::Progress` is a change to the REPLY, which carries a
/// status byte and a length and no kind — so the "step over what you do not know"
/// property the request framing has does not exist on the way back:
/// `DecodeReplyHeader` refuses a status outside its own set, and a launcher built
/// before this meets a progress frame by abandoning the compile. Keeping the range
/// open would therefore not buy a mixed fleet anything; it would buy a mixed fleet
/// that fails at the worst possible moment, several minutes into a translation unit,
/// as a transport failure naming nothing. Refusing the older request outright is
/// `UnsupportedVersion`, which names the supported range and is answered before a
/// byte of source is sent.
///
/// The second thing it buys is that the capability needs no negotiation at all:
/// every accepted request is version 3, so every client a worker answers understands
/// a progress frame, and nothing has to remember a per-connection flag. Backwards
/// compatibility on this wire is not owed
/// ([#332](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/332)) — one
/// installation, major version 0 — and a loud, named, immediate refusal is what that
/// budget is best spent on.
///
/// **It moved again for version 4, for the same reason and a sharper one.** The
/// REGISTER reply's payload changed shape, and a reply carries a status byte and a
/// length and no kind -- so a version-3 worker meeting a version-4 reply does not
/// refuse it. It reads the whole payload as its worker id, exactly as it always has,
/// and registers successfully under an id that is really a serialized record. That
/// is silent, it is durable, and it is the shape
/// [`.agent/rules/metrics-and-observability.md`](../../../.agent/rules/metrics-and-observability.md)
/// spends its length on: a wrong answer that looks like a right one. Refusing the
/// older REGISTER outright is `UnsupportedVersion`, which names the range and
/// arrives before the worker believes it has joined anything.
///
/// **And again for version 6, which is version 4's case exactly.** The LEASE reply
/// gained a field, and `SplitFields` is exact about arity -- so a version-5 launcher
/// meeting a version-6 grant does not misread it, it fails to decode it at all, which
/// is the better half of this. The reason the range still cannot stay open is the
/// other direction: a version-6 launcher against a version-5 scheduler decodes
/// nothing either, and the alternative -- accepting a three-field grant and falling
/// back to the constant -- is precisely the silent wrong answer #522 exists to
/// remove, reintroduced as a compatibility shim. A client that cannot learn the
/// fleet's lifetime must not guess it.
///
/// **And again for version 7 -- on a DIFFERENT argument from every one above, which
/// is why it is spelled out rather than filed under "the floor always moves".** The
/// three bumps above all rest on the failure being SILENT: a version-3 worker misreads
/// a version-4 REGISTER reply as a worker id, a pre-#245 launcher abandons a compile
/// minutes in. Version 7's does not. `NodeStatusFields` grew a sixth top-level field
/// and `SplitFields` is exact about arity, so a version-6 client fails to decode the
/// body at all and says so by name -- *"answered node-status with a body this client
/// cannot read"*. On the usual argument that would be a reason to LEAVE the floor at 6
/// and let older clients keep every verb whose shape did not move, which is most of
/// them.
///
/// The floor moves anyway, because of what leaving it would ADVERTISE. A window is
/// only real if this build can still SERVE the older version, and it cannot:
/// `EncodeNodeStatus` emits one shape and takes no version, so a floor of 6 would have
/// this build ACCEPT a version-6 request and answer it with bytes no version-6 client
/// can read. That is a supported version by advertisement and an unsupported one in
/// fact -- the version-4 paragraph's own defect one level up, since
/// `UnsupportedVersion` names the range -- `CompileCacheHandler`'s own
/// *"unsupported wire version {}; this server speaks {}..{}"*, whose numbers are these
/// two constants and are deliberately not restated here -- which
/// `docs/tools/pace-cc.md` documents as meaning a mixed install, while a decode
/// failure names no version and reads as a corrupt reply or a protocol bug. Refusing
/// by name is the more actionable of two loud failures.
///
/// Serving both shapes is the only other honest option and buys nothing here:
/// `docs/operations/upgrading-a-fleet.md` already documents the stop-upgrade-start
/// procedure, both binaries ship together, and this node has one installation
/// ([#332](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/332)), so the cost
/// of the flag day is one local rebuild. Opening a real window is the work that page
/// describes and is not owed yet.
///
/// **And again for version 8, whose argument is version 7's INVERTED.** It is written
/// out for the same reason 7's was: *the floor always moves* is not a reason, and the
/// reason here is not any of the four above. Every one of them rests on the older peer
/// failing -- loudly (7, 6) or silently-and-wrongly (4, 3). A version-7 client meeting
/// a version-8 CLUSTER-ADMIT reply does neither. It **succeeds**, correctly, and
/// quietly loses the change: that client renders its sentence from the verb it asked
/// and reads no reply body for this one at all, so an added payload is neither misread
/// nor refused. It prints *"accepted; the change is replicating"* -- still true -- and
/// drops the receipt.
///
/// That is worse than either loud failure, and worse **in this verb specifically**.
/// The receipt exists so that an operator compares two printed strings, and a string
/// that is missing does not announce itself as missing: there is nothing on the screen
/// to be suspicious of, and the operator concludes the comparison passed because they
/// never knew there was one. #1296 is a ticket about a quiet failure; a floor left at
/// 7 would manufacture a second one inside the fix.
///
/// A window is also only real if this build can SERVE the older version, and it cannot
/// for the reason version 7 could not: `EncodeClusterAdmitReceipt` emits one shape and
/// takes no version, so a floor of 7 would ACCEPT a version-7 request and answer it
/// with a body that version has no reading for. Supported by advertisement,
/// unsupported in fact.
///
/// The mirror direction rules out meeting in the middle. A version-8 client against a
/// version-7 leader asks for a receipt and is handed an empty body: it either refuses
/// -- loud, but misattributed, since an absent body reads as a corrupt reply rather
/// than as an older leader -- or renders nothing, which is the missing string again.
/// `UnsupportedVersion` naming the range -- the same sentence, rendered from these two
/// constants -- is the only one of the three that sends an operator to the right
/// machine.
///
/// The cost is unchanged from every bump above and is stated rather than reasoned from
/// again: one installation
/// ([#332](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/332)), both binaries
/// shipped together, and the stop-upgrade-start procedure that page already carries.
///
/// Version 9 moves it for version 3's reason: `Status::Push` is a status an older reader
/// refuses, so accepting a version-8 request would answer it in a grammar it cannot read.
///
/// Version 10 moves it for version 7's: `NodeMetrics` answers one shape and takes no version,
/// so a floor of 9 would accept a version-9 request and answer it with a body that version has
/// no reading for.
///
/// Version 11 moves it for the same reason: `EncodeClusterAdmitReceipt` emits one shape, three
/// fields, and a version-10 request answered with it would be answered in a grammar that
/// version has no reading for -- and a version-10 request is two fields, which the exact-arity
/// decoder refuses anyway.
///
/// Version 12 moves it for version 3's reason, and for a sharper one of its own: a version-11
/// ENROLL was answered, when approved, with the cluster KEY, and a leader that still accepted one
/// would have to either refuse it anyway or keep a secret-handing path alive for it.
///
/// Version 13 moves it for version 12's: a version-12 announcement is three fields, which the
/// exact-arity decoder refuses, and a version-12 client has no reading for the roster the reply
/// now carries.
///
/// Version 14 moves it for version 3's reason and a sharper one: a version-13 caller proves with a
/// MAC under a key this build no longer holds, so accepting its request would either refuse the
/// proof as a wrong key -- a confident wrong diagnosis for a version mismatch -- or keep a
/// pre-shared-key path alive for it, which is the path #178 exists to retire.
///
/// Version 15 moves it for version 3's reason and two sharper ones: a version-14 LEASE grant names
/// no worker key, so a version-15 client accepting one would take an UNSIGNED compile reply as
/// served -- the very forgery a signed reply exists to refuse -- and a version-14 AUTH carries no
/// credential kind, so a machine ticket and a password would be one field read two ways. Refused by
/// number, the mismatch names the range before a byte of either is read.
///
/// Version 16 moves it for version 3's reason: ADMIT's reply may carry `Status::Progress`, and a

// Everything below frames the four dispatch verbs. Two conventions are shared by
// all of them and are worth stating once.
//
// **Integers travel big-endian in a length-prefixed field of their own**, the way
// every other multi-byte quantity here does. A field holding a `u32` is exactly
// four bytes; a decoder that finds any other length rejects the frame rather than
// reading what it can, because a short integer field is a sender this build does
// not understand rather than a value to guess at.
//
// **Bulk payloads travel in a codec envelope**, `[u8 codec][u32 rawLen][bytes]`.
// The codec byte is the id from `Core/Compression.hpp`'s `CompressionCodec`, and
// `Identity` (0) is the uncompressed form, always available even in a build
// configured without compression. The id is NOT re-declared here: this header must
// stay dependency-free (see the file header), so it frames the byte and leaves its
// meaning to the one enum that owns it. Both ends static_assert the agreement in a
// translation unit that includes both, so drift is a build failure rather than a
// wire incompatibility discovered in production.
//
// `rawLen` is the size BEFORE compression and is what a receiver sizes its output
// buffer from. Carrying it is what lets a decoder reject a payload whose declared
// expansion exceeds its cap before decompressing a byte — a compressed frame is
// otherwise an unbounded allocation wearing a small size on the wire.

/// Size of a codec envelope's fixed header: the codec byte plus the raw length.

/// a caller that lets the decoded buffer die before reading `bytes` has a
/// use-after-free.
///
/// **It borrows rather than owning, and that is measured rather than assumed.**
/// Its one production consumer is `OpenAs` in the launcher's `CodecEnvelope.cpp`,
/// which reads it immediately and in the same scope -- and whose `Identity` branch
/// hands `bytes` straight to the caller's container with a comment saying that an
/// intermediate `std::vector<std::byte>` there "would be a second full copy of a
/// preprocessed translation unit, on the path a build with compression configured
/// out takes for every payload -- the one least able to afford it". Owning here
/// would reinstate exactly that copy, to buy safety that consumer does not need.

/// *admitted*, *added* or *committed*. An echo that reads as *in force* when it is
/// *taken down* is a confident wrong signal, which this codebase rates worse than a
/// vague right one.
///
/// *Will be proposed* is safe for the same reason and is a shade weaker than the

/// ([#1296](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1296)).
///
/// **What it buys, stated narrowly, because the wider claim is false.** The leader
/// records verbatim what this client sent, so holding the echo against the same
/// operator's own keystrokes proves the message round-tripped and nothing else. What it
/// is FOR is the comparison against the OTHER machine, which is where the disagreement
/// lives: the joiner mints its own id into `--cluster-dir` and resolves its own
/// consensus endpoint, and the seed can know neither. Printed here, the pair is held
/// against the joiner's own `NodeStatusFields::nodeId` and the address it was given by
/// `--raft-self`/`--listen-raft` -- two printed strings from two machines, rather than
/// one string and a memory.
///
/// **Owning rather than a `*View`**, against this file's local convention for reply
/// bodies and by the conjunction the rule states: a view needs every consumer to read
/// it in scope AND something to depend on not copying. The second clause is false --
/// this is a member id and a `host:port`, and both ARRIVED inside a request the verb's
/// own `MaxControlPayload` row had already bounded, so neither is large -- and
/// what the field DECIDES is an operator's eyeball comparison, so a borrowed one that
/// outlived its buffer would print a plausible endpoint assembled from freed memory,
/// which is the failure this record exists to remove arriving through the record

// One `LiveStream` served on two REAL reactors, the shape `pace-kv --threads 2` runs (#1399).
//
// Every other live-stats case drives one `core::net::testing::TestLoop`, where one thread does everything and no
// subscriber can wait on another. The daemon shares ONE stream across all of its reactors -- the
// per-tick capture cache behind one mutex, the cap behind one atomic -- so what those cases cannot
// see is what one reactor's subscriber costs another's: a lock held across work on one thread is a
// reactor thread blocked on the other. These cases run each reactor on its own thread against the
// real clock, and judge PROGRESS rather than time: every reactor carries a heartbeat whose beats are
// the observation that its thread ran, and whose lateness is printed beside a verdict, never as one --
// a host that does not run a thread for a while moves a lateness exactly as the defect does.

/// pace-kv's own compile-cache protocol handler (the "executor").
///
/// Unlike the redis/memcached handlers, this one knows a cached value is a
/// **compile result** — an untouched object blob plus captured compiler text
/// (`/showIncludes`, diagnostics) carrying machine-specific paths. It closes
/// the cross-machine "value portability" gap by:
///
///   - **On STORE**: canonicalizing every path in the value's text regions,
///     using the *producing* machine's layout supplied in the frame, into
///     machine-neutral tokens (see PathCanon). The object blob is stored
///     verbatim, never rewritten. The stored value therefore has no machine
///     identity, so no producer can poison a shared entry for another.
///   - **On FETCH**: returning the canonical form **verbatim**. The client
///     localizes the tokens back to its own layout — the server stays off the
///     per-consumer transform path.
///
/// The wire format itself — magic, version, opcodes, statuses, error codes, and
/// the encoders and parsers for all of them — lives in `Protocol/CompileCacheWire.hpp`,
/// which the launcher and the test client share verbatim. This class holds only
/// the *policy*: the order the checks run in, what each refusal costs the
/// connection, and what a command does once it has parsed.
///
/// A request is `[0xFC][version][op][u32 payloadLength]` followed by exactly that
/// many bytes of length-prefixed fields; a reply is `[status][u32 payloadLength]`
/// followed by its payload, uniformly for every status. Because both lengths are
/// declared, a refusal can be answered and stepped over instead of closing the
/// connection — which is what lets a future version add a verb without a flag day,
/// and what lets a version mismatch produce a diagnosable message instead of a
/// dropped socket indistinguishable from a dead peer.
///
/// Per-command policy:
///
///   - bad magic                      → close (the peer is not speaking this protocol)
///   - unsupported or changed version → Error/UnsupportedVersion, then close
///   - payload over the session cap   → Error/PayloadTooLarge, drain, then close
///   - unknown opcode                 → Error/UnknownOpcode, skip the payload, **continue**
///   - gated verb before AUTH         → Error/Unauthenticated, skip the payload, **continue**
///   - fields ≠ declared payload      → Error/MalformedFrame, continue
///
/// The version is pinned to the first command's: a stream that changes version
/// mid-connection is nonsensical rather than merely unsupported, and saying so is
/// cheaper than carrying two decoders.
///
/// ## Authentication
///
/// This handler was the only one in the tree that never consulted
/// `SessionContext::CurrentAuth()` — memcached text, memcached binary and RESP all
/// did. So a daemon started with `--requirepass` gated every protocol *except*
/// this one, and an operator reading the flag's documentation had no way to know
/// it. That is a cache-poisoning surface on its own, and it becomes remote code
/// execution the moment the compile-cache port carries anything that runs a
/// compiler, which is why closing it comes first.
///
/// Which verbs are reachable before a credential is accepted is a **column of
/// `OpTable`** (`OpDescriptor::preAuth`), not a predicate here: it is the
/// security-relevant property of the whole verb set, so it must be readable off
/// the table, and a verb added without a thought about it defaults to closed.
///
/// The gate runs *before* the payload is buffered and drains it with `Skip`, for
/// the reason `MemcachedBinary` does the same: gating afterwards would let an
/// unauthenticated peer pipeline frames declaring the full payload cap and force
/// the allocation of all of it per frame.
///
/// The state is per-connection, and the policy is re-read on every command so a
/// SIGHUP that toggles `requirepass` reaches connections that are already open in
/// both directions. Clients pipeline `AUTH` ahead of their real command rather
/// than waiting for its reply, so authentication costs bytes but no round trip —
/// see the note in `CompileCacheWire.hpp`.

/// `SurfaceRefusal.hpp` argues that refusal coverage is a property of the TYPE, and the
/// rule this encodes is the metrics rulebook's -- *a refusal's wire code and its counter
/// are one row* -- which is not node-specific: any surface that refuses owes it. It was
/// hoisted into `apps/fastcache-compile-node/FrameEndpoint.hpp` during #523 because
/// `Protocol/` was outside that lane's grant, which left the next surface to re-derive it
/// or do without. It briefly WAS three: one named predicate for the cache plus the same
/// truth table open-coded twice as `answer.has_value() != !rationale.empty()`, two of them
/// in the inverted form and neither reachable by a grep for the name.
///
/// **In its own header rather than in `SurfaceRefusal.hpp`, which is where #640 expected
/// it, and the reason is a constraint that ticket told me to check for.**
/// `check-worker-refusals-counted.cmake` DERIVES the set of refusal spellings from
/// `SurfaceRefusal.hpp`, by taking every `[[nodiscard]]` declaration in it -- which is
/// what stops a fourth spelling being added there and asserting nothing -- and then
/// requires that set to agree with the number of `EncodeErrorReply` calls, because "each
/// spelling is built on exactly one". Putting these two functions there made it **5
/// spellings against 3 encoder calls**, and the check refused, correctly: by its

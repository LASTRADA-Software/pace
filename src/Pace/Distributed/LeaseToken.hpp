/// The lease token: what the scheduler signs, and what a worker will check before it
/// spawns anything (#282 -- see "What this does NOT close" below).
///
/// ## What this closes
///
/// A lease used to be a small decimal serial the scheduler minted for its own
/// bookkeeping, and the worker's validator was `[](...){ return true; }`. So a
/// worker compiled for anyone who could reach its port and present any string:
/// the lease was capacity accounting the scheduler kept, never a credential the
/// worker could check. Membership decided *who may connect*; nothing decided *who
/// the scheduler actually sent*.
///
/// ## What this does NOT close
///
/// Only the scheduler half. It **mints** a signed grant and authenticates one handed
/// back to `Release`; no worker checks a token before it spawns a compiler yet, so a
/// compile port's boundary today is still reachability plus membership. That half is
/// [#282](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/282), and until it
/// lands `VerifyLeaseToken` and `LeaseRefusalTable` below have no production caller.
/// A signed grant nobody verifies buys nothing on its own; what it buys is that the
/// format, the wire codes and the counters exist for #282 to be written against,
/// which is also why signing must ship first -- a worker that refused unsigned leases
/// before every scheduler in a fleet could mint them would stop distributing
/// mid-upgrade.
///
/// ## Why it is header-only
///
/// `apps/pace-cc/WorkerProtocol.cpp` is where a lease will be verified, and that
/// file is compiled into `pace-cc`, which deliberately does **not link**
/// `Pace`. Being header-only over `Core/Ed25519`, `Core/Base64` and the
/// header-only `Core/WireFields` is what lets the launcher's build reach this
/// with dependency-free rows in `_pace_cc_core` -- and the vendored Monocypher, which
/// depends on nothing -- rather than a link against the library: the same rule
/// `Protocol/CompileCacheWire.hpp` states about itself, and for the same reason.
///
/// ## Signed by a MEMBER, not by the cluster (#178)
///
/// A grant was an HMAC under the cluster's pre-shared key until #178, so every holder of the
/// key could mint one, and a machine removed from the cluster went on minting grants every
/// worker honoured. It is now an Ed25519 signature by the issuing voter's OWN identity key,
/// and it names that voter: a worker verifies it against the key its roster holds for the
/// named signer, and refuses a signer that is not a voter there -- or whose key the cluster
/// revoked -- however well-formed the grant is.
///
/// It performs no I/O and holds no state: every function here is a pure transform,
/// and `now` is a parameter rather than an injected clock precisely so that both
/// callers keep their own time seam. That is the documented exception to this
/// project's inject-everything rule -- a genuinely pure leaf computation -- and
/// not an oversight.

/// the fleet was restarted, while admitting the one thing it existed to stop.

/// disguise.** Retention is re-evaluated only inside `Spend`, against the caller's
/// `now`, so "everything still acceptable is still remembered" holds exactly while the
/// clock is monotone. A worker whose clock is minutes AHEAD -- a resumed VM, a container

/// entries whose window merely looks passed; when NTP steps it back, those tokens verify
/// again and are no longer remembered. One extra spend each. Bounded by the same window
/// and by how far the clock moved, and not worth durable state either, but it is a
/// second residual rather than a restatement of the first.
///
/// Two worker PROCESSES advertising one endpoint is a third, for the same reason: each
/// keeps its own set. That one is a deployment mistake rather than a property of this
/// type.
///
/// ## Bound
///
/// One entry per grant, dropped once `Detail::WithinAcceptanceWindow` -- the verifier's
/// own predicate -- says the grant could no longer be accepted at all. That is
/// `expiresAt` plus the clock-skew slack and never `expiresAt` alone, so the set holds
/// what the scheduler issued inside one lease lifetime and nothing older. Pruning is
/// amortized onto `Spend`, which runs once per dispatched compile: there is no timer,

///
/// **The signal it replaces was not missing, it was WRONG**
/// ([#614](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/614)). Three ordinary
/// operator actions drop a scheduler's term back to 0 -- wiping the Raft directory,
/// re-bootstrapping the cluster, turning consensus off -- and before #614 every worker
/// that had learned a higher term then refused every grant until its process restarted.
/// On the worker that showed only as `WorkerLeaseStaleEpoch` climbing, which reads like
/// an election storm: an operator whose fleet stopped distributing was pointed at
/// consensus instability when the cause was a reset they performed themselves.
///
/// **What it says changed with what happens.** #768 shipped this as the observability
/// half of a refusal, latched and cleared by an accepted grant, because the downward
/// path was still open and the condition persisted until a restart. The condition is
/// gone: the worker adopts the lower term and goes on compiling. So the line reports a
/// TRANSITION rather than a state, and needs no latch -- a transition happens once by
/// construction, and a scheduler that flaps says it once per flap, which is the right
/// number.
///

/// Which machine a caller on the `0xFC` surface is, proved, and the key its frames are sealed
/// under from then on (#178).
///
/// ## What this is for
///
/// Admission on that surface used to be decided by the caller's SOURCE ADDRESS, and then by a MAC
/// under the cluster's pre-shared key. An address stops standing in for *this is one of our nodes*
/// the moment it is not stable; a shared key never said WHICH node, so removing one machine meant
/// rotating the key on all the others, and a removed machine kept every byte it needed to prove
/// itself. This is the replacement: each machine signs with its own identity key, the one the
/// cluster admitted, and a revocation is one roster entry.
///
/// ## The handshake
///
/// 1. `NodeChallenge{nonceC, ephC}`: the caller's nonce and ephemeral X25519 key.
/// 2. `{serverId, serverKey, nonceS, ephS, sigS}`: the server says who it is and signs everything
///    so far under `NodeProofSignature::ServerChallenge`. A caller that holds a roster checks that
///    `serverKey` is a live voter's before it proves anything -- so a revoked ex-scheduler still
///    named in a worker's `--scheduler` is refused by the WORKER.
/// 3. `ProveNode{clientId, clientKey, sigC}`: the caller signs everything so far, `sigS` included,
///    under `NodeProofSignature::NodeProof`. The server verifies under `clientKey` first and asks
///    its roster second.
///
/// ## Why every frame after it is SEALED
///
/// A signature proves who signed THIS handshake; it says nothing about the frames that follow on
/// the connection. Without a seal, a machine the worker dials -- a revoked ex-scheduler still in
/// its `--scheduler` list, or anything on the path -- relays the handshake to the real scheduler,
/// lets the genuine proof through, and then injects verbs of its own on the connection the proof
/// admitted. So both ends derive a key per DIRECTION from the X25519 exchange, which the relay
/// cannot compute, and every later frame carries an HMAC under it (`Core/SessionSeal`): an
/// injected frame fails its tag and the connection closes. That is the property the seal is for,
/// and `FrameEndpoint_test` holds the endpoint to it with a relayed handshake over a real socket.
///
/// ## Pure
///
/// No socket, no clock, no randomness: the ephemeral secret and the nonce arrive from a caller
/// that drew them through `ISecureRandom`, and the identity key from one that read it once.

// The wire's widths against the types that fill them. `CompileCacheWire.hpp` spells its own
// numbers because the launcher compiles it in and it may include nothing from `Core/` beyond
// three leaf headers; this is the one file where both are visible, so it is the only place the
// two can be held equal. A BUILD failure rather than a test, because a field silently truncated
// has both ends sign different inputs and report a forgery for a version mismatch.

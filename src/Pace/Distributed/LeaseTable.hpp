/// ## What a lease is for
///
/// Two things, and they are worth separating because only the first is obvious.
///
/// **It authorizes a job.** A worker must not compile whatever arrives on its
/// port; it compiles what the scheduler said to. The token is the scheduler's
/// signature on one job, which is what lets a worker refuse a client that reached
/// it directly without going through scheduling at all.
///
/// **It suppresses duplicate work.** When sixty parallel clients miss the same key
/// after a header change — which is the ordinary shape of a miss on a shared cache,
/// not an exotic one — only the first should be dispatched. The other fifty-nine
/// are told `AlreadyInFlight` and compile locally. That is strictly better than
/// dispatching sixty identical jobs, and it is something neither distcc nor
/// sccache-dist can do, because neither is also the cache.
///
/// ## Why leases expire
///
/// A client can die between taking a lease and sending the job — `Ctrl-C` on a
/// build is the common case, not a rare one. Without expiry that key would be
/// marked in-flight forever and every later compile of it would be refused, so a
/// single interrupted build would permanently un-distribute one translation unit.
/// Expiry is what makes the suppression safe to have at all.

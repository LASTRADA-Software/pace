/// while an over-loose match produces a **silently wrong object** that is then
/// stored under a key other machines will fetch. There is no symmetry between
/// those two errors, so the match is exact and no configuration can loosen it.
///
/// ## Why most-headroom rather than round-robin, or least-outstanding
///
/// Compile times vary by an order of magnitude within one build — a header-heavy
/// template instantiation against a small C file. Round-robin queues a 40-second
/// translation unit behind another 40-second one while a worker sits idle, because
/// it distributes *arrivals* rather than *load*.
///
/// Least-outstanding fixes that and introduces its own error, which is that it
/// treats every machine as an identical box: a 64-slot server running 8 jobs looks
/// busier than a 4-slot laptop running 2, when the server has 56 slots free and the
/// laptop has none. Across a fleet of mixed machines — the ordinary case in a
/// peer-to-peer fleet, not an exotic one — that sends work to the smallest machines
/// first and leaves the big ones idle. So the comparison is on **free slots**, with
/// utilization breaking the tie, and what counts as a free slot is
/// `AvailableSlots` rather than the registered count: a machine somebody else is
/// using, or one whose disk has filled, has fewer than it registered with.

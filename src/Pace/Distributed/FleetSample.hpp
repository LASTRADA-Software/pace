/// **ORDINALS ARE A PERSISTED CONTRACT. Append only; never insert or reorder.** (#308)
///
/// A history file's body is `[start][sample][present][coverage][N values][N folds]`, where `N`
/// is the width the format VERSION that wrote it used -- see `FleetHistory.cpp`'s
/// `LegacyValueWidth`, frozen at nine for versions 1 and 2 forever, and this build's
/// count from version 3 onward. The readings are stored POSITIONALLY, indexed by
/// `static_cast<std::size_t>(metric)`, and read back the same way. Inserting an
/// enumerator mid-enum therefore does not fail to load: every bucket already on disk
/// comes back with each reading attributed to the NEXT series, silently, for as long
/// as the file exists. A cache-hit count rendered as a gauge of jobs in flight, with
/// nothing anywhere reporting a fault.
///
/// The same ordinal is also `CompileCacheWire::HistorySlotCount`'s width, positionally,
/// over the wire -- see the `static_assert` tying the two in `SchedulerProtocol.hpp`.
/// That record is variable-arity (a peer carrying fewer slots is tolerated, extra ones
/// from a newer peer are ignored), so growing this needs no `CompileCacheWire` version
/// move; the two on-disk history formats do, because EACH of their layouts is
/// fixed-width per version -- `FleetHistory.cpp`'s `RingFile` for a node's own series
/// and `NodeStoreFile` for what it received from others, independently, since a
/// nested body inside the latter carries no envelope of its own to move on its own
/// schedule.
///
/// The explicit `= N` is the enforcement rather than decoration. Without it a mid-enum
/// insertion is one added line with no other visible change; with it, the same edit
/// either collides or shows up in review as a renumbered literal on every row below it.
/// `Last` carries one too, because `readability-enum-initial-value` accepts all, none or
/// only-the-first and this tree does not silence clang-tidy. It also earns it: forgetting
/// to bump it while adding a slot makes the new enumerator COLLIDE with `Last`, which
/// shortens `EnumeratorCount` and fails `RowsInEnumeratorOrder`'s static_assert against
/// `FleetMetricTable`. One line of friction, caught at compile time rather than in a

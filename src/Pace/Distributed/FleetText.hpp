/// **Two documents, and there is no reading of either on which these bytes may

/// its bad-range refusal -- each spelled this prologue out, and the two copies had
/// already drifted apart by a newline before anybody consolidated them
/// ([#1344](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1344)). Neither
/// half is cosmetic: a document with no viewport meta renders at desktop zoom on a
/// phone, and the 401 is the most-seen page of a rollout, while a charset one document
/// declares and the other does not is how a peer's display name comes back mojibake on
/// one page and reads correctly on the next.
///
/// **It stops where the pages legitimately diverge, which is why this is a constant
/// and not a helper.** What the dashboard writes next is a conditional
/// `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` that the 401 must not carry, and then each page's own
/// title and stylesheet. A helper spanning that would take a refresh interval, a title
/// and a stylesheet -- three parameters to place one shared line -- so what is shared
/// is exactly the bytes that must never differ and nothing below them.
///
/// **The two `<title>` literals are identical text today and are deliberately not in
/// here**, and the reason is not that a title names its page -- in this tree it does
/// not: `MinimalHtmlPage` hands the same `pace fleet` title to the 401 and to the
/// bad-range refusal, so the title already spans three documents on one URL. The reason
/// is that the prologue is a CORRECTNESS property of any document -- how it renders,
/// which encoding it is read in, whether a screen reader knows its language -- while a
/// title is CONTENT. Two documents disagreeing about a title is cosmetic; two
/// disagreeing about a charset is mojibake.
///
/// The newline is the dashboard's, kept so that page's bytes are unchanged: its
/// `<style>` block is multi-line, so its source is readable in a `view-source:`.
/// Nothing pinned it -- the doctype assertions on both surfaces are
/// `starts_with("<!doctype html>")`, which both spellings satisfy -- and the node's
/// small pages gaining one costs them nothing.
///
/// `apps/pace-cc/Stats.cpp` opens its report with a third spelling and keeps it
/// for now, and **not because that binary cannot reach this header**: the launcher's
/// own rule is header-only and std-only -- stated at the top of `Stats.cpp` against
/// its own `Core/Ranges.hpp` include -- and this header plus both `Core/` headers it
/// pulls in, `Ranges.hpp` and `Utf8.hpp`, have no `.cpp` between them. One of the two
/// is the very header `Stats.cpp` already compiles in. It is excluded because that page is a

/// this prologue changes what it renders. That is a fix to that report, not a fourth

/// What was last said about a set of secret-bearing files, so a repeat is silent.
///
/// #384's readability check runs at a START, and `requirepass` is `Reloadable::Yes`
/// -- so a configuration file can **gain** a secret after startup and that path was
/// silent in exactly the way the ticket was written to close
/// ([#753](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/753)).
///
/// **It re-asks the filesystem and compares against a REMEMBERED answer. It does not
/// diff the two configuration snapshots, and that is the whole design.** A file's
/// MODE is in no configuration, so a reload that loosens permissions on a file whose
/// `requirepass:` never moved produces two byte-identical snapshots -- and an
/// implementation reasoning from the reloader's previous-and-current pair would
/// conclude nothing changed and never look at the file. That is one of the two
/// transitions #753 requires; the other, a secret appearing in a file whose mode was
/// always loose, IS visible in the snapshots, which is what makes the snapshot-diffing
/// version look correct while covering half the ticket.
///
/// **The answer, not the sentence.** What is remembered is `(path, exposure)`, so a
/// file whose exposure changes KIND -- group-readable, then world-readable, with
/// different remedies -- is a transition and is reported. Comparing rendered text
/// would agree today and would stop the day a hint loses information.
///
/// **A standing exposure is said once**, because a warning repeated at every SIGHUP
/// is the alarm-nobody-reads failure arriving by a different route -- the same trade
/// #741 records for a true positive on a shipped default. An exposure that CLEARS is
/// silent too: this reports what an operator must act on, not a status line.
///
/// A path that leaves the set is FORGOTTEN, so a secret removed and later put back
/// into the same still-exposed file warns again. It is a fresh transition into
/// exposure and the operator's last warning was about a state that stopped being
/// true in between.
///
/// Not thread-safe, and it does not need to be: `ConfigReloaderOf` calls subscribers
/// synchronously on the thread that invoked `Reload()`, which is the one signal
/// thread, and the startup observation runs before any of them.

/// subscriber capturing **`WorkerBody`'s** locals -- the reloader is declared in

/// Live-reload pipeline, over whatever configuration type an executable has.
///
/// Holds an atomic `shared_ptr<ConfigT const>` snapshot; `Reload()` re-reads the file
/// at the original path, asks whether the candidate may replace the live one, then
/// publishes the new snapshot and notifies subscribers.
///
/// ## Why this is a template, and what is deliberately NOT in it
///
/// **Two executables have configuration files and there must be ONE reload
/// mechanism.** `pace-kv` reads `Config`; `pace-node` reads
/// `NodeConfig` through the option table's `yamlKey` column
/// ([#291](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/291)). Writing a
/// second reloader for the second one is what this codebase keeps a list about — the
/// two would drift on the questions that matter, which are the ordering of the swap
/// and what happens on a partial failure, not on the parsing.
///
/// So the type varies and the *pipeline* does not. What varies with it arrives as two
/// injected steps rather than as branches:
///
/// - **`Reparse`** — how a file becomes a candidate configuration. Both executables
///   rebuild the candidate the way the START built the live configuration: the node
///   replays the appliers argv reached, and the daemon re-runs
///   `AssembleEffectiveConfig` — file, then command line, then environment. So "the
///   command line wins" stays a question of which loop ran second, at a reload as
///   much as at a start. The daemon used to read the file and nothing else, which
///   published a setting nobody had asked for at every SIGHUP
///   ([#622](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/622)).
/// - **`ImmutabilityCheck`** — whether the candidate may replace the live snapshot.
///   Both executables now derive this from a **column of their own option table**
///   ([#406](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/406) closed the
///   daemon's hand-written ladder), so the strategy varies only in which table it
///   reads. One reloader with two tables is one mechanism; two reloaders would not
///   be.
///
/// ## Declined, never half-applied
///
/// A candidate that cannot be read, or that changes something immutable, leaves the
/// live snapshot **exactly as it was** and no subscriber is called. That is one rule
/// for both failures on purpose: an operator saved a file once and expects one
/// outcome, and a process whose configuration is half the file and half the previous
/// one has no single artefact describing what is in force.
///
/// Subscribers are called synchronously, on the thread that invoked `Reload()` — the
/// signal-handling thread, or the SCM control-handler thread on Windows. They must
/// keep their work bounded and defer anything heavy onto the affected subsystem's own
/// threads.
/// @tparam ConfigT The configuration this executable reloads.

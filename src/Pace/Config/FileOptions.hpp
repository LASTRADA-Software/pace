/// Applying a configuration FILE through the same option table the command line
/// uses, so a setting has one applier rather than two that can disagree.
///
/// ## Why this is not a merge
///
/// The daemon used to read YAML into a `Config` through a second parser, parse argv
/// into a `CliResult`, and then merge the two field by field -- a per-field row list,
/// a per-field explicit bit and a per-field presence bit, none derived from the
/// others. Four lists that had to agree, and a flag which parsed but never merged
/// shipped four times; the second parser accepted `port: 0x50` while argv refused
/// `--port=0x50` (#1437).
///
/// Here the file's values and the command line's reach the config through the SAME
/// `apply`, in that order, so "CLI wins" is the order they are applied in and there
/// is nothing to keep in step. A row that parses cannot fail to merge, because
/// parsing and merging stopped being two things.
///
/// ## It lives in `Config/`, not `Cli/`
///
/// `Cli/Options.hpp` is compiled into `pace-cc`, which does not link
/// `Pace` -- so an include of anything from `Config/` there breaks the
/// launcher's link rather than merely its build. This header is where the option
/// table meets the YAML reader, which is why it is on this side of that line.

/// Apply file settings to `result` through `table`.
///
/// Each setting is matched to the row whose `yamlKey` it names, and every value it
/// carried is passed to that row's `apply` -- once for a scalar, once per element
/// for a sequence. The row's `explicitBit` is then set when a value was APPLIED,
/// because that is the operator naming the setting; which instance of the result that
/// bit is read from is what distinguishes "named it anywhere" from "typed it on the
/// command line" (see the node's `main`). A presence flag's `false` applies nothing and
/// so names nothing: `no_toolchain_discovery: false` is the flag not passed, and a bit
/// set for it would refuse a node for a setting nobody gave (#206).
///
/// A key naming no row is refused rather than ignored. A file is read at every
/// start, so a key nothing reads is a setting an operator believes is in force
/// forever -- the exact failure this mechanism exists to remove, and a typo is the
/// common way to reach it.
///
/// **Errors are attributed to the FILE, and name the key rather than the flag.**
/// `ApplyOneOption` stamps a row's `primary` for the same reason -- a shared
/// value parser cannot know which row reached it -- but stamping `--cache-memory`
/// on a bad `cache_memory:` would send an operator to look at a command line they
/// never typed. Same mechanism, deliberately different value.
/// @param table The rows to match against.
/// @param settings What the file carried, in document order.
/// @param path The file, for error attribution.
/// @param result The result to populate.
/// @return Nothing, or the first setting that could not be applied.

/// The generation of the stored-value contract this build writes and reads: the
/// first byte of every encoded value, and the one thing a reader learns about a
/// value before it decodes anything else.
///
/// **It is not only a framing version.** Canonical text travels nowhere but inside
/// a CompileValue, so `PathCanon` deliberately carries no version of its own and
/// says so at length — which makes this byte the name of the *canonicalization
/// spec* the value's text regions were rewritten under, as well as of the layout
/// they are framed in. Two servers stamping one number onto text they rewrote by
/// different rules is a wrong value under a correct key, at fleet scale, on a
/// correctly-maintained fleet: a fleet is permanently mid-upgrade
/// ([#173](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/173)), so
/// "every server on this wire canonicalizes identically" is a property that has to
/// hold ACROSS versions or it does not hold at all
/// ([#483](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/483)).
///
/// So the coupling is **asserted, not remembered**. `CompileValue_test.cpp` runs a
/// fixed conformance corpus through `CanonicalStoredValue` and
/// `PathCanon::LocalizeRegion`, digests the result, and pins that digest against
/// this number in a generation table. Move the canonicalization behaviour without
/// moving this byte and the test goes red naming the bump; move the byte without a
/// row and it goes red too. Before that table the invariant was stated in
/// `PathCanon.hpp` and enforced by nothing, which is the difference between an
/// invariant and a hope.
/// **Generation 2** retired generation 1 at
/// [#547](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/547), the first
/// real customer of the machinery above. A bare root — `/`, `C:\` — is its own
/// trailing separator, and neither side of the transformation knew it: the producer
/// matched nothing, so a value stored by a build rooted at the filesystem root kept
/// that machine's absolute paths, and the consumer emitted `//inc/a.hpp` on POSIX
/// and a UNC-shaped path on Windows.
///
/// **What the bump retires, stated positively rather than as a rule that did not
/// apply.** Moving this byte retires stored objects AND direct-mode manifests, on
/// its own: a manifest is stored wrapped in a `CompileValue`, so the launcher
/// decodes it through `DecodeCompileValue` and a build at generation 2 meeting a
/// generation-1 envelope gets nothing back and misses. `manifest-v*` therefore buys
/// no additional retirement here and would spend a second invalidation event to do
/// it — and the standing lock-step that would have demanded one runs `objkey-v*` to
/// `manifest-v*`, which is a different pair and one-way. The producer half re-keys
/// by itself for the reason the `objkey-v4` bullet gives: the key changes for
/// exactly the translation units whose canonicalization changed, so a stale entry
/// becomes unreachable rather than servable under rules it was not written by. The
/// consumer half is what genuinely needs this byte, since there the key is unchanged
/// and only the localization moved.
///
/// **Generation 3 retired generation 2 at
/// [#879](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/879) and
/// [#891](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/891), which are two
/// ways for one grammar to find no path spans at all.** `Grammar::ShowIncludes`
/// recognised a note only when the line began with the literal English
/// `Note: including file:`. A localized `cl` prints a translated prefix (#879), so the
/// region was stored with the producing checkout's absolute paths in it —
/// [#229](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/229) reached through
/// the grammar rather than through a missing canonicalizer, and a replayed region
/// becomes the object's dependency record, so those never invalidate. #891 rode along
/// on a reading of `cl`'s indentation that
/// [#1270](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1270) later measured
/// and reversed; generation 5 is where that lands.
///
/// What moves with the byte is the marker becoming a CANONICAL FORM — see
/// `PathCanon::IncludeNoteMarker`, and note that the producer normalizes to it, since
/// only the producing machine knows what language its own notes are in. It changes
/// what a value's bytes look like without changing the key, which is precisely the
/// half the previous paragraph says needs this byte: a generation-2 value from either
/// machine is unusable and is now refused rather than localized under rules it was not
/// written by.
///
/// What it does NOT close: a localized toolchain whose prefix nothing has told this
/// build about still stores an unnormalized region, because an unmatched marker
/// rewrites nothing. Discovering that prefix from the compiler is
/// [#878](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/878), and it needs no
/// further generation — the stored form is already locale-free, so #878 only supplies
/// a better value to normalize with.
/// **Generation 5 retired generation 4 at
/// [#1270](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1270), which put
/// back the half of the anchor #891 gave away.** #891 read `cl`'s inclusion-depth
/// indentation as preceding the marker and widened `Grammar::ShowIncludes` to skip
/// leading blanks. Measured on both installed toolsets and on `clang-cl`, under `/c`
/// and `/EP`, at depths one to six: the marker is at COLUMN ZERO on every note and the
/// depth is a run of blanks BETWEEN marker and path. The widened rule therefore
/// matched a shape no driver emits, while admitting one that occurs — an indented line
/// that merely begins with the marker, which in a DIAGNOSTIC region is a path a
/// compiler quoted and one layer up, in preprocessed source, is a line the launcher
/// deleted from the bytes the key is hashed over.
///
/// The byte moves because the two rewrite text differently: a generation-4 value whose
/// diagnostic region carried such a line was stored canonicalized, and a generation-5
/// build replaying it would put a `<SRCROOT>` token into the build log rather than a
/// path. That is what `ForeignGeneration` refuses, and refusing it costs a miss.
///
/// **And ONLY this byte moves: no `objkey-v*` or `manifest-v*` bump rides with it.**
/// `PathCanon.hpp` names both mechanisms in one sentence with this one, so the reasoning
/// is written down here rather than left to be re-derived at the next bump:
///
/// - **The key construction is unchanged.** #1270 changes what the hashed text CONTAINS
///   -- `SplitIncludeNotes` stops deleting a line from it -- not how it is hashed, and
///   `ComputeKey`'s pinned vector is green across the change.
/// - **There is no input for which the key is unchanged and the right object differs.**
///   That is the whole safety case. The narrowing only ever ADDS bytes back to the text
///   the key covers, so a source carrying a line that used to be deleted now hashes
///   DIFFERENTLY and misses every entry written under the old rule, while a source with
///   no such line hashes identically and its old entries are still correct for it. The
///   two populations do not overlap, which is what a tag bump would otherwise be for.
/// - **Direct mode fails CLOSED, so `manifest-v*` stays put.** A manifest stores the
///   object key by value and its own key never sees the preprocessed text, so an old
///   manifest does still resolve -- but it resolves to a generation-4 VALUE, and the
///   direct path decodes through `DecodeCompileValue` exactly as the ordinary path does.
///   `ForeignGeneration` refuses it and the launcher takes the miss. Checked rather than
///   assumed: were direct mode able to reach an old object without passing the generation
///   gate, this would be a three-version change.
///
/// **Generation 6 retires generation 5 for two changes to what a server does with one
/// region, paid for with one cold cache.**
///
/// - **The MSVC family's streams carry `Grammar::MsvcStream`**, notes AND diagnostics.
///   Tagged `ShowIncludes`, which rewrites note lines only, every `cl` and `clang-cl`
///   warning, error and `note:` was stored and replayed carrying the producing checkout's
///   absolute path -- measured as C4100 in a header, served across two checkouts with
///   direct mode off, under a key those checkouts share by design. The diagnostic head
///   is anchored at column zero and tightened to `(<digits>[,<digits>]): `, which also
///   narrows `MsvcDiagnostics`. An older server meets tag 4, refuses the frame, and the
///   refusal costs a miss; a generation-5 value holds foreign paths nothing marks, and
///   this byte is what retires it.
/// - **`CanonicalizeRegion` collapses `..` out of a span before matching the roots**
///   ([#1593](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1593)). A driver
///   reports `D:\proj\build\..\inc\a.hpp` for a header reached through a relative
///   include chain, and generation 5 stored it as `<BUILDTREE>/../inc/a.hpp` -- a token
///   naming a file the path does not name, which localizes into a consumer whose build
///   tree sits elsewhere as a path to nothing. A span whose collapsed form lies under no
///   root is canonicalized exactly as before, from its own spelling. #1593 was held open
///   to ride the next bump rather than buy one; this is that bump.
///
/// The key construction does not move with either, and needs no second bump here: this
/// branch's `objkey-v7` / `manifest-v7` already retire every entry and manifest an
/// earlier launcher wrote, and the `ForeignGeneration` gate is what refuses a generation-5
/// value that reaches a generation-6 build any other way.
///
/// **Generation 7 retires generation 6 for four changes the Job 2 review measured**, each
/// a region a generation-6 server stores differently:
///
/// - **A span whose collapsed form lies under NO root is stored as that collapsed
///   absolute spelling.** Generation 6 matched it as written, and `<SRCROOT>/../third/x.h`
///   resolves against the CONSUMER's root depth, so it named a different file there --
///   #1593's hazard, in the one place #1593's first fix did not reach.
/// - **The MSVC diagnostic head accepts `(<digits>) : `**, the `#pragma message(__FILE__
///   ...)` idiom MSVC documents: direct mode shares its manifest across checkouts and the
///   stream grammar is all that keeps the replayed message local.
/// - **`Grammar::MsvcStream` reads `clang-cl -fdiagnostics-format=clang`'s GCC-format
///   head**, `<path>:<line>:<col>: `.
/// - **The `..` collapse holds a UNC share aside as its anchor**, so `\\host\share\..\x.h`
///   is `\\host\share\x.h`, where Windows resolves it, and never `\\host\x.h`.
///
/// Generation 6 never left the branch that introduced it, and it is retired rather than
/// amended anyway: a frozen generation is a claim about behaviour, and a server built
/// from that branch still stamps 6 on text it rewrites the old way. No key moves.

// The whole difficulty of testing this is that the evidence lives in memory the
// allocator has just handed back. Reading a freed heap block is undefined and ASan
// reports it, so the obvious test cannot be written -- and a test that only checks the
// container's own bytes proves nothing, because a `std::vector` keeps the secret on the
// heap and not in its footprint.
//
// So the test OWNS the storage. `Arena` is an ordinary object with a lifetime the test
// controls; `ArenaAllocator` hands out slices of it and never reuses or returns them.
// `SecureAllocator`'s real `deallocate` then runs against that arena, and afterwards the
// bytes are still a live object this test may read. Nothing is undefined, nothing is
// freed, and the wipe is observable by construction.
//
// This is the dependency-injection rule applied to memory: production substitutes
// `std::allocator` for the upstream and changes nothing else.

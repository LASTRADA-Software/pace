// Sealing the frames of an authenticated session (#178).
//
// A session is what two ends agree on at the end of a handshake: a KEY only they hold,
// derived from an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exchange both of them signed. Every frame after
// the handshake carries an HMAC-SHA256 tag under that key, over the frame's position in its
// session and its bytes -- so a frame changed, dropped, replayed, reordered or carried over
// from another session fails its tag, and there is no field an attacker could set to make it
// pass.
//
// **Here, in `Core/`, rather than in the Raft peer wire it was written for**, because it is
// not about Raft: it is what the `0xFC` wire needs next, and a second copy of "tag a frame
// under a session key at an implicit position" would be two constructions that can drift.
// What a wire derives its key FROM -- which transcript, which labels -- stays with the wire.
//
// **One direction per key.** A sealer and an opener over one key agree on ONE count, so a
// wire that sends both ways derives a key per direction; one that shares a key between two
// senders has two counts claiming the same positions, and each end refuses the other's frames.
// The Raft peer wire derives one per direction on every connection, and seals with the
// acceptor's only on one whose proof asked for `RaftWire::SessionDirection::TwoWay`.
//
// Pure: no socket, no clock, no randomness. The key arrives from a caller that drew it.

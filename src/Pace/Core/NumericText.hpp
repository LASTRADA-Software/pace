/// @file NumericText.hpp
/// Parsing numbers out of text, where the obvious spelling is not portable.
///
/// **This exists because `std::from_chars` has no floating-point overload on some
/// libc++ versions** -- macOS before 26.0, which is what `macos-14` runners have --
/// so `std::from_chars(first, last, someDouble)` compiles on libstdc++ and MSVC and
/// fails to compile on macOS. Every integral use of `from_chars` in this tree is
/// fine; only the floating-point one is not.
///
/// The implementation below was written for `RedisResp.cpp`'s `INCRBYFLOAT` and lived
/// in that file's anonymous namespace, with its reasoning in a comment there. That is
/// exactly where a rule reaches nobody: a new file's author has no reason to open the
/// RESP handler, and the natural thing to write is the `from_chars` call that does not
/// build on one platform. It cost `pacectl` a red `macOS-clang-release` on its
/// first push. Moved here rather than copied -- a second implementation citing the
/// first in a comment vouches for its bugs without inheriting its fixes.

/// Parse a finite double from @p text in a locale-independent way, rejecting trailing
/// garbage and non-finite inputs.
///
/// Two steps, and both are load-bearing:
///
/// 1. **Validate the bytes against the numeric grammar** first: an optional sign, then
///    digits carrying at most one `.` anywhere among them, then an optional exponent
///    whose own digits are required. `3.` and `.5` are accepted, as `strtod` accepts
///    them and as the callers this was written for expect. This step is what catches an
///    embedded NUL, whitespace, and a locale-specific decimal separator (`,`) that no
///    wire here speaks -- and it runs BEFORE the stream, so a refusal never depends on
///    what the host's locale happens to be.
/// 2. **Parse with `std::istringstream` pinned to the classic C locale.** Without the
///    `imbue`, a host whose `LC_NUMERIC` does not use `.` -- `de_DE.UTF-8`, say --
///    would reject the very format this project's own `std::format` writes. Portable
///    across POSIX and Windows, unlike `uselocale`.
///
/// Non-finite is refused rather than returned: a caller that wants RESP3's `inf`,
/// `-inf` and `nan` matches those names itself, because they are spellings rather than
/// numbers and nothing should be guessing which of the two it has. That refusal happens
/// in step 1, not in the finiteness guard -- those three words carry letters, so the
/// grammar has already rejected them.
///
/// One `istringstream` construction per call. On no hot path -- `INCRBYFLOAT`, and a
/// reply type the client does not request.
///
/// @param text Text to parse.
/// @param out Receives the parsed value on success; untouched on failure.
/// @return True iff the whole of @p text is a finite double.

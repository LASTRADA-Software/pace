/// What a consensus refusal is *about*.
///
/// The distinction a retrying caller needs, and the one that has no other spelling:
/// a refusal either describes the **command** -- in which case offering it again
/// changes nothing, ever -- or it describes the **moment**, in which case the command
/// is fine and the next one would be refused identically.
///
/// It exists because `ConsensusTier::Reconcile` proposes a LIST. Abandoning the pass
/// at the first refusal is right for a moment-shaped one, and it was the only kind
/// that could arise when that code was written; a command-shaped one silently costs
/// the cluster everything after it in the list -- including the quorum reconciliation
/// that follows -- on every pass, forever, with one log line per interval as the
/// symptom. That is half of the trap #159 records.
///
/// **`Satisfied` is a third state and not a shade of the other two** (#196). "The
/// proposed member set is the one already in force" is a refusal only in the sense
/// that nothing was appended: the caller's goal is TRUE, which neither *this change
/// can never work* nor *ask again later* can express. Folded into `Command` it is
/// reported at Warn as a record somebody must go and correct; folded into `Moment` it
/// abandons a pass that had nothing left to do anyway. Both are the misleading
/// symptom this classification exists to remove, so the state is named -- which is
/// this repository's own rule that skipped, absent, unstarted and failed are four
/// states and every convenient summary collapses them.

    Satisfied, ///< Already true. Nothing was appended because nothing needed to be.
};

/// What each refusal is about, one row per `ConsensusErrorCode`.
///
/// A table rather than a comparison against the one enumerator that is different
/// today, because the failure it guards against is a code appended later and
/// classified by whichever way an `if` happened to be written -- which is a silent
/// cluster-wide stall if it lands on the wrong side.

/// `Cluster::Validate` is the sole producer -- and wrong for one from proposing a
/// membership change. That was guarded by a sentence in `SubjectOf`'s own doc and by
/// `ConsensusTier::ReconcileQuorum` declining to consult it, which is the weakest
/// kind of guard: the obvious next tidy-up would have wired it in and reported *wait
/// for the change in flight to commit* as **can never be recorded as it stands**, at
/// Warn, every reconcile interval, for a condition that resolves itself in one
/// commit. Splitting the enumerator is what makes the table say something true
/// wherever it is consulted -- and it fails the BUILD until each new code has decided
/// what it says on the wire, because `SchedulerService`'s `WireCodeFor` is an

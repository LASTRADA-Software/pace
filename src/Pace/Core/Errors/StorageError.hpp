    /// than numbering it, so a fresh log line no longer carries an ordinal at

    /// that number would otherwise silently start matching a different condition

    /// Deliberately not `IoError`: the file is intact and the remedy is the

    /// inspect a healthy store is most of what made the silent version of this
    /// bug expensive.
    ///
    /// Appended for the same reason as the enumerator above, and the reason
    /// survives even though `ToString` now names the code rather than
    /// numbering it: a log line written by an OLDER build still carries an
    /// ordinal, so moving an existing enumerator would retroactively change
    /// what those lines appear to say.

    /// A stored value did not decode as the type its flags claim.
    ///
    /// **Deliberately not `Corrupt`, and this one is reachable on demand.** A set or
    /// a stream is an ordinary value blob distinguished only by its `flags` word, and
    /// the memcached text verbs let any client choose that word -- so a client can
    /// plant six bytes, tag them as a set, and read them back with SMEMBERS. Reporting
    /// that as `Corrupt` told an operator their DISK had failed, on a store whose every
    /// record still verified: the rule `.agent/rules/storage.md` records about an old
    /// store applies here with more force, because this is an INPUT rather than a rare
    /// migration edge, and `Corrupt` is what gets a healthy cache deleted.
    ///
    /// The remedies are opposite, which is the test for whether two conditions may
    /// share a code. `Corrupt` means the bytes on disk are damaged and there is
    /// nothing to recover. This means the bytes are exactly what somebody wrote and
    /// they are not a well-formed value of that type -- nothing is wrong with the
    /// store, and the thing to look at is the client.
    ///
    /// **A value codec could never honestly report `Corrupt` in the first place**,
    /// and that is the sentence to keep: integrity is verified BELOW those codecs.
    /// `CowTreeStorage` checks CRC32C and `Core/Compression` checks its own framing,
    /// and each returns `Corrupt` itself before a byte reaches a decoder. So by the
    /// time `SetCodec::Decode` or `StreamCodec::Decode` runs, the bytes are known to
    /// be the bytes somebody stored -- the only remaining question is whether they
    /// are a well-formed value, which is this code and nothing else.
    ///
    /// It is also **not** a persistence failure, and that omission is load-bearing
    /// rather than incidental. `Corrupt` IS one, so a malformed set moved
    /// `pace_write_errors_total` and wrote a `storage write failed` warning --
    /// an unprivileged client driving the disk-failure signal at will, which is the
    /// mechanism that would actually walk an operator to deleting a healthy cache.
    /// `WriteErrorReportingStorage::IsPersistenceFailure` therefore leaves this code
    /// out, deliberately. It has a counter of its own (`CacheMalformedValues`)
    /// because an absence of signal would be the other way to get this wrong.
    ///
    /// Distinct from `WrongType`, which is the neighbouring answer and a different
    /// question: `WrongType` is "the flags say string and you asked for a set", while
    /// this is "the flags say set and the bytes are not one".

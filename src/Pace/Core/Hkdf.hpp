// HKDF over HMAC-SHA256 (RFC 5869), on this tree's own `HmacSha256` (`Core/Sha256`).
//
// **No production caller yet, by design.** PR 1 of #178's staged plan: PR 3 turns each Raft peer
// session's raw X25519 secret into its frame key with this. Do not remove it as unused before then.
//
// It is the sibling of `Core/Ed25519` and `Core/X25519` but needs no Monocypher: HMAC-SHA256 is
// already here, verified against RFC 4231, and a second SHA-256 would be a second implementation
// of one function to keep identical on every machine. So it is NOT one of the files allowed past
// the crypto seam, and `ctest -R crypto-seam` would refuse it for including a Monocypher header.
//
// Every intermediate that carries key material -- the PRK, each block T(i), the buffer T(i) is
// computed over -- lives in a `SecureByteBuffer` or is wiped with `SecureZero`, the tree's one
// zeroing primitive, before it goes out of scope.

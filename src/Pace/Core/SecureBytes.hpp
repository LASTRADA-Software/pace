///
/// **Why an allocator rather than a wrapper that wipes in its destructor.** Every release
/// goes through one door, so no holder has a line it can forget to write. That is the
/// `Refuse`/`ClaimReadSlot` argument: a guard folded INTO the operation is self-enforcing,
/// a guard called alongside one needs a scan to stay true.
///
/// It is also what makes COPIES safe without anybody thinking about them, which is not
/// hypothetical here — an `Ed25519KeyPair` is an ordinary copyable value whose secret half
/// is one of these, so a node's identity key exists in as many buffers as its key pair has
/// copies, with independent lifetimes, and each one's block is wiped when that buffer
/// dies. A destructor-wiping wrapper gets this right too, but only for holders somebody
/// remembered to wrap.
///
/// And it covers REALLOCATION, where a destructor-based design cannot: a vector that grows
/// moves its elements to a new block and frees the old one long before it dies, leaving a
/// copy the destructor will never see. **Two holders in this tree grow one**, and both
/// arrived with #1125: `ReadSecretFile` in `fastcache-cli/main.cpp` and in
/// `fastcache-compile-node/AdminEndpoint.cpp` each `insert` chunk after chunk into an
/// unreserved `SecureCharBuffer`, so a secret larger than one chunk is reallocated while
/// it is being read and every intermediate block is freed before the buffer dies. This
/// paragraph said there was no such holder, which was true when it was written and was
/// falsified by the commit that added it — a claim of the form *nothing does this yet* is
/// only ever as current as its last reader, and the two readers are named here so the next
/// change to them meets the reason instead of the count.
///
/// **What it does not cover, stated rather than left to be discovered.** A container that
/// stores small values inside its own footprint never calls an allocator for them, so this
/// seam cannot reach them. `std::vector` has no such optimisation and is fully covered.
/// `std::basic_string` does, and the threshold is a property of the STANDARD LIBRARY rather
/// than of the language: measured, an inline capacity of **15 on libstdc++ 14** and **22 on
/// libc++ 22**, so a 16-to-22-character secret is on the heap on Linux and inline on macOS.
/// One secret, one build, two answers.
///
/// **That is what `SecureString` below is for, and it resolves the question this paragraph
/// used to leave open** ([#1125](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1125)).
/// The sentence here predicted *"a secret string needs this allocator AND an inline wipe"*.
/// The second half turned out to be avoidable rather than necessary, and avoiding it is the
/// stronger answer: a wipe of the inline footprint cannot be made correct, because a string
/// that GROWS past the threshold moves its characters to the heap and leaves the inline
/// bytes behind, and nothing can wipe them at that moment. Backing the text in a
/// `std::vector`, which has no such optimisation at all, removes the storage the wipe would
/// have had to chase — so there is one mechanism here, not two, which is the condition
/// #1125 set for itself.
///
/// **Why not `std::pmr`.** A `memory_resource` would inject the arena without a template
/// parameter, and it was considered. It loses on two counts that matter here rather than
/// on taste: the whole point of the alias below is that adopting it at a holder is a type
/// change and nothing else, and `std::pmr::vector` puts a `memory_resource*` inside every
/// `DiscoveryConfig` and `SchedulerService` that has to be pointed somewhere; and pmr's
/// default resource is process-global mutable state, which is what the injection rule in
/// AGENT.md exists to keep out of this tree.

///
///  - **Small-string optimisation.** Such a string is covered only while its characters are
///    on the heap, and whether they are is a property of the standard library rather than of
///    the program: 15 characters fit inline on libstdc++ 14 and MSVC STL 19.51, 22 on
///    libc++ 22. The same secret in the same source is heap-allocated on Linux and Windows
///    and inline on macOS.
///  - **The inline-to-heap transition, which has no answer at all.** A string that GROWS
///    past the threshold copies its characters to the heap and leaves the old ones sitting
///    in the inline buffer. A destructor-time wipe reaches the storage the object is using
///    NOW, never the residue of storage it has already left, and no allocator is called for
///    the buffer it abandoned. There is no hook at that moment.
///
/// **Read those in that order and stop at the first, and you will write the wrapper**: SSO
/// alone looks answerable, because an inline wipe answers it. It is the second that cannot
/// be wiped, only avoided — which is the same argument as *the wipe is an allocator, not a
/// destructor*, one step further along. A `std::vector` has no inline footprint to leave
/// behind and no transition to miss, so both gaps close by construction rather than by
/// anybody remembering.
///
/// So the characters live in a `std::vector`, which has no small-object optimisation, and
/// **every** byte of the secret is therefore in a block the allocator above releases — on
/// destruction, on assignment and on reallocation alike, identically on every platform. One
/// mechanism, which is the condition #1125 set for itself: this is `SecureAllocator`
/// instantiated over characters, not a second seam beside it.
///
/// **Not a `std::string` replacement, deliberately.** It carries `empty()`, `size()`, a
/// `std::string_view` and equality — which is the whole of what a credential is asked for
/// in this tree, and is why adopting it at a holder is a type change rather than a rewrite.
/// It grows no concatenation, no `c_str()` and no formatting: every one of those spells a
/// way to make a copy the allocator does not own.

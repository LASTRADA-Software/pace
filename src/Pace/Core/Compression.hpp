/// with the build green and every test passing. `AvailableCodecsCoverEveryCodec`
/// in `WorkerProtocol_test.cpp` fails when that happens; a public enumeration here
/// would remove the need for it.
///
/// `Identity` is always available — even in a build configured with
/// `FASTCACHED_ENABLE_COMPRESSION=OFF` — and stores the value verbatim. It is
/// also the shrink-check fallback: a value that does not get smaller when

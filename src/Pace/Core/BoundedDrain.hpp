/// The second reader is why this is here and why it stays in PRODUCTION rather than being a test
/// affordance. It is also what makes an abandoned TEST binary legible at all: a test's `ILogger` is
/// a `CapturingLogger` nobody reads, so before this line a case that reached the ceiling did not
/// fail -- it vanished, taking every case after it in that process, with two lines of banner and no
/// explanation anywhere a person looks (#297).
///
/// **The trailing newline is load-bearing.** `std::_Exit` runs no `atexit` handler and flushes
/// nothing, deliberately -- that is the whole reason it is used here -- so delivery rests on a
/// property of the stream rather than of this code. C11 7.21.3p7 requires stderr to be *not fully
/// buffered*, which permits unbuffered OR line buffered, and a message ending in `\n` is delivered
/// under either. Measured separately, and NOT the same claim: on glibc the text survives even
/// without the newline, to a pipe and to a file, because glibc leaves stderr unbuffered -- that is
/// this platform, not the guarantee. So do not drop the newline, do not "fix" this with an

/// The one answer to *what may an XML-family document carry, and what does it write
/// instead* -- shared by everything in this tree that interpolates untrusted text
/// into markup.
///
/// **Why this is in `Core/` rather than beside its first consumer.** It began in
/// `Distributed/FleetText.hpp`, which was right while the fleet page and the fleet
/// charts were the only consumers. The third consumer is
/// `Platform/ServiceControl.cpp`, which interpolates a path, a launch argument, a
/// label and an account name into a launchd plist -- and `Platform` must not depend
/// on `Distributed`, which sits above it. The content is a pure function of
/// `Core/Utf8.hpp` with no fleet in it, so `Core` is where it belongs and where the
/// comment on `TextEscape` below already anticipated it going.
///
/// **Where its tests are, which is not here.** `Distributed/FleetText_test.cpp`.
/// That is deliberate rather than an oversight left behind by the move: those cases
/// assert markup, JSON and the tab-separated format *as a family* -- "Whatever these
/// are given, what comes out is UTF-8" is one case over all three -- and the family
/// property is what a reader needs to see, so splitting the cases to follow the
/// declarations would cost more than the convention of a `_test.cpp` per header buys.

/// How markup spells a code point the bytes did not encode.
///
/// A numeric character reference rather than the three bytes of U+FFFD, so the
/// repair is visible in a `view-source:` and costs the document nothing: the
/// output stays ASCII exactly where the input stopped being text.
inline constexpr std::string_view MarkupReplacement = "&#xFFFD;";

/// One byte an output format must not carry literally, and what it writes instead.
///
/// Here rather than in a `Detail` namespace because SEVERAL translation units spell
/// the same rows: `fastcache-cli`'s `--format=tsv` writes the same four as
/// `/fleet.txt`, and an operator pipes both into one script. It was a second struct
/// there, with the replacement field named `replacement` rather than `spelling` --
/// and two names for one concept is the worse half of a duplicate, because a reader
/// who knows one file does not recognise the other (#1334).

/// exists: over a `std::array` libstdc++ and libc++ yield a raw pointer, so
/// clang-tidy's `readability-qualified-auto` asks for `auto const* const`, which
/// MSVC's class-type iterator cannot deduce. `TraitsOf` in `Platform/ServiceControl.cpp`
/// is the same two lines.
///
/// This site used to hand-roll the scan, and the rule in
/// `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` permits that -- a site wanting a VALUE out
/// of a range may scan and name no iterator. It takes the helper anyway because the
/// function is cross-binary API, and a shared helper that re-derives what a shared
/// helper already solved is how a tree ends up with the explanation written out
/// seventeen times instead of the answer used once. Where the helper is genuinely
/// unreachable the scan is still right: `CompileCacheWire::FindOp` hand-rolls it
/// because that header must stay dependency-free for the launcher.

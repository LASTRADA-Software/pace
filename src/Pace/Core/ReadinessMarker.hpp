/// node's marker as. Leaving the enumerator out means the mistake cannot be spelled
/// here.

/// `Unstated` is the zero value, so a row that omits the column has it and the
/// `static_assert` below refuses the build. That is `BindFailurePolicy`'s idiom and
/// it is the answer to the `0 of 0` shape

/// ## Why these literals are a table and not four format strings
///
/// `compile node ready` is a readiness contract for **four fixtures in two
/// languages** and was named by no constant and pinned by no test
/// ([#654](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/654)). Rewording a
/// human-facing log line is an ordinary thing to do; every unit test would pass, the
/// build would be green, and four fixtures would then wait on a string nothing
/// writes -- each failing by TIMEOUT, the slowest and least informative failure
/// there is, reported against whatever the fixture happened to be waiting for.
///
/// The worse case is already on record and involved no rename at all: #365 changed
/// what the node's line MEANT, from *surveyed* to its present sense, while every
/// fixture went on matching the string, and three include-tree walks silently
/// stopped being serialised (#634). **A rename breaks loudly but late; a re-meaning
/// does not break at all** -- which is why `fact` and `meaning` are columns rather
/// than comments, and why the test over this table asserts the text byte for byte.
///
/// The daemon's row is here for the same reason and to avoid a second source of
/// truth: `ReadinessAnnouncer` reads its text from this table rather than keeping
/// its own copy, or the fix for #654 would contain #654.

/// ## Why this is shared rather than written where it is needed
///
/// An IPv6 literal contains colons, so the obvious `rfind(':')` splits `::1:6674`
/// at the wrong one and hands back a host of `::1:` — or, worse, succeeds with a
/// plausible-looking wrong answer. The bracketed form `[::1]:6674` is what the
/// grammar exists for, and getting it right is four lines that every caller would
/// otherwise write for itself.
///
/// `pace-cc`'s `TcpClient.cpp` had the only correct copy, file-local. A
/// second caller — the worker's `--admin-listen` — is what turned "a private
/// helper" into "a rule with two authors", which is the shape this codebase
/// treats as a defect rather than a coincidence.
///
/// ## Why `Core/` and header-only
///
/// The same constraint `WireFields` and `Cli/Options` are under: `pace-cc`
/// compiles against these without linking `Pace`, so anything needing a
/// translation unit would break the launcher's *link* rather than merely its
/// build. Nothing here touches a socket — it is text in, text out — so there is
/// nothing to link.

/// Split `host:port` into its parts, honouring the bracketed IPv6 form.

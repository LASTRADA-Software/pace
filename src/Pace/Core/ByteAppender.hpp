/// The writer half of the wire grammar `ByteCursor` reads.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// `ByteCursor::ReadField` gave `[u32 length][bytes]` a name on the reader's side, and
/// the writer's side went on being spelled by hand in six encoders -- four of them
/// building the length prefix with `WriteBigEndian` into a local array, one with a shift
/// chain, each then inserting the payload itself
/// ([#305](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/305)). Naming one
/// direction and not the other is the worse of the two states: the hand-rolled writer
/// stops reading as leftover and starts reading as deliberate, and an encoder and a
/// decoder that do not share a statement of the grammar are how the two drift.
///
/// ## What it borrows
///
/// It holds a **reference** to the caller's buffer and appends to it, exactly as
/// `ByteCursor` holds a span over the caller's bytes. It is a walk, not a value: the
/// buffer outlives it, and nothing here is returned by value to a caller that might
/// outlive what it points at. See `.agent/rules/wire-and-protocol.md` on why a decoded
/// struct returned by value must not borrow -- this is the other shape, and the
/// distinction is that this one never leaves the expression that made it.
///
/// ## Where it lives
///
/// Beside `ByteCursor` and under the same constraint, which `Core/WireFields.hpp`
/// argues in full: it must be includable from a header `pace-cc` compiles
/// **without linking `Pace`**, so it stays header-only and reaches nothing but
/// `Core/Bytes.hpp`, `Core/Endian.hpp`, `Core/WireFields.hpp` and the standard library.
/// Anything added here keeps both properties.
///
/// ## No bare `u32` append
///
/// The public surface has none, mirroring `ByteCursor::ReadU32` being private and for
/// the same reason turned around: a bare `u32` on this wire is either a field's length
/// prefix or an element count, and each of those has a member that enforces something a
/// bare append cannot. `AppendField` refuses a payload whose length cannot be declared;
/// `AppendCount` refuses a count that cannot be written. Both refuse rather than
/// truncate, the way `WireFields::RequireEncodable` already did for a whole field list,
/// and every site this replaced cast the size down instead.
///
/// The surface is otherwise deliberately only what a caller reaches today, as
/// `ByteCursor`'s is. A member that would pull in a new dependency belongs elsewhere.
///
/// @tparam Buffer The buffer being appended to.

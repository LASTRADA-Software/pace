/// The fixed frame header every length-declaring binary protocol here starts

///
/// ## Why this is a header of its own
///
/// The same argument `WireFields` next door makes about the *payload* grammar,
/// applied to the *frame*. `CompileCacheWire` and `RaftWire` each spelled these
/// seven bytes out — the encoder character-identical, the decoder differing only
/// in what it named the third byte, and `IsSupported` identical outright. Sharing
/// the field grammar and then hand-rolling the frame around it leaves the two
/// halves of one format with different authors, and the half left duplicated is
/// the half a reader reaches first.
///
/// What the header does **not** decide is what any of it means. The magic is the
/// caller's, so two protocols on two ports stay distinguishable; the kind byte is
/// returned raw and validated against the caller's own table; and the supported
/// version range is passed in, because the wires version independently and always
/// will. This is the byte layout and nothing above it.
///
/// ## Why `Core/`, and why header-only
///
/// Inherited from `WireFields`, for the same reason stated there: it must be
/// includable from `Protocol/CompileCacheWire.hpp`, which `fastcache-cc` compiles
/// in **without linking `Pace`** — so anything here that needed a
/// translation unit would break the launcher's *link*, not merely its build.

/// A wire protocol version.
///
/// A plain integer rather than an `enum class`: it is an ordered quantity
/// compared against a supported range, and an enumeration would need a cast at
/// every comparison.

/// indistinguishable from a lost reader, which is the difference between skipping

/// Every file a compile node keeps in its state directory, and the ONE place each is named.
///
/// Header-only and in Core, because the files are written from four layers -- consensus
/// (`FileRaftStorage`), cluster (`FileFormationStore`, `FleetEndpointsFile`), distributed
/// (the histories) and the node itself (its key and id) -- and a name spelled
/// in any one of them would be a state file the node's table of them (`Node::NodeStateFiles()`)
/// does not know. Every writer takes its name from here, the node's table is keyed by the same
/// enum, and both tables are asserted complete: a new file is a new enumerator, and an enumerator
/// without both rows does not compile.
///
/// **And its ACCESS**, for the same reason: who may read a state file is decided here, per row, and
/// the create every writer calls (`Platform/FileTrust`'s `CreateStateFile`) takes the file rather
/// than a mode -- so on POSIX a file's mode is the row's, EXACTLY, and never whatever the umask of
/// the process that happened to write it leaves.

/// Bytes nobody can predict and no two draws share, from the operating system (#1527).

/// **A seam apart from `IRandomSource`, because the two answer different questions and fail
/// differently.** `IRandomSource` hands out values in a RANGE for election jitter and
/// tie-breaking, where a predictable or repeated draw costs a slower election and nothing
/// else, and where a fixed seed that replays a failure is the whole point. What this hands
/// out is what a handshake nonce and a minted node id are made of, and there a REPEAT is the
/// failure: a nonce drawn twice lets a recorded exchange be replayed whole, and an id minted
/// twice is two machines the cluster cannot tell apart.
///
/// **Why a seeded engine cannot stand in for this, which is what #1527 found.** Both of those
/// were drawn from `SystemRandomSource`, an `std::mt19937_64` seeded from `std::random_device`,
/// on the argument that a 64-bit-seeded engine meets a never-repeat bound. The argument
/// assumed its seed was random. On the WSL2/libstdc++ host #1507 was measured on,
/// `std::random_device` answers ZERO for 57% of draws (measured: 1652 of 2880, across 32
/// processes). Both seed halves zero is then roughly a third of processes (0.57 squared --
/// inferred, not reproduced), each drawing the same "random" stream, so an acceptor restarted
/// there can re-issue the challenges its previous run issued. A never-repeat bound needs an
/// ENTROPY SOURCE, and an engine is only ever as good as the one it was seeded from.
///
/// **A failure is a REFUSAL, and there is no fallback** -- not to `std::random_device`, not to
/// a clock, not to an engine. A fallback turns *this host cannot produce entropy* into *this
/// host produces a weak nonce and says nothing*, which is the defect this seam exists to
/// remove. Every caller that cannot draw stops what it was doing, by name.

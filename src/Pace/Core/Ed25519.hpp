// Ed25519 signatures (RFC 8032 §5.1), over the vendored Monocypher (#178).
//
// **The key pair's first production caller is a node minting its identity key (#178 PR 2); signing
// and verifying have none yet, and that is the plan rather than dead code.** PR 3 signs the Raft
// handshake with that key. Do not remove `Sign` or `Ed25519Verify` as unused before it lands -- the
// design comment on #178 is the argument, and this header is its seam.
//
// This file and its two siblings (`Core/X25519.hpp`, `Core/Hkdf.hpp`) are the ONLY way into the
// vendored implementation: no other first-party file may include a Monocypher header, and
// `ctest -R crypto-seam` refuses one that does. A caller that wants a curve operation this seam
// does not offer adds it HERE, where it is reviewed against the RFC vectors in `Ed25519_test.cpp`,
// never by reaching past it.
//
// Pure Ed25519, the RFC 8032 function: SHA-512 inside, no context, no pre-hash. NOT Monocypher's
// default `crypto_eddsa_*`, which is EdDSA over BLAKE2b -- a different signature scheme whose
// signatures no other Ed25519 implementation verifies, and which the RFC's vectors cannot test.
//
// No randomness is drawn here. Ed25519 signing is deterministic, and a key pair is derived from a
// seed the CALLER supplies -- from the operating system's generator (#1527's `ISecureRandom`) for a
// new identity, or from the file a node's identity was minted into. So these functions touch no
// ambient state and need no seam of their own.

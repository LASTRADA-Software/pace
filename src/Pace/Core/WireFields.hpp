/// The length-prefixed field grammar every binary protocol here packs its
/// payloads with: a sequence of `[u32 length][length bytes]`.
///
/// ## Why this is a header of its own
///
/// It was written once, inside `Protocol/CompileCacheWire.hpp`, whose own
/// documentation states the reason it should not be written twice: *"a second
/// hand-rolled packer is how a producer and its parser drift"*. That is exactly
/// what a second protocol needing the same grammar would have produced, so the
/// grammar moved here and `CompileCacheWire` now consumes it. The consequence
/// worth knowing is that a change to the packing rules here changes **every**
/// protocol that shares it — which is the point, and is why the encoder and the
/// splitter live side by side rather than in the two files that use them.
///
/// ## Why `Core/` and not `Protocol/Framing/`
///
/// `Protocol/Framing/` is where the *stream* readers live, and they are compiled
/// into the library. This is a pure byte-level transform with no socket, no clock
/// and no state, and it has to be includable from `Protocol/CompileCacheWire.hpp`
/// — which `fastcache-cc` compiles in **without linking `Pace`**, so an
/// include of anything that needs a translation unit there breaks the launcher's
/// link rather than merely its build. Sitting in `Core/` beside `Endian.hpp` and
/// `Bytes.hpp`, header-only and dependency-free, is what keeps that constraint
/// satisfiable rather than merely stated. Anything added here must keep both
/// properties.
///
/// ## What it deliberately does not do
///
/// It knows nothing about frame headers, magic bytes, opcodes or versions. Those
/// are per-protocol and stay with their protocol; only the payload grammar is
/// shared. A caller frames the result however its own wire says to.
///
/// The module performs no I/O and holds no state, so there is nothing to inject —
/// the same deliberate exception to the project's dependency-injection rule that
/// `CompileCacheWire` documents, for the same reason.

/// Largest payload a single field can carry, since each length prefix is a u32.
///
/// Enforced by the encoder rather than assumed. Casting an over-large size down
/// to `std::uint32_t` would quietly emit a field whose declared length disagrees
/// with its contents, which is precisely the desynchronisation a declared length
/// exists to prevent.
inline constexpr std::uint64_t MaxPayload = 0xFFFFFFFFULL;

/// Bytes a field costs before its contents: its length prefix.
inline constexpr std::size_t FieldPrefixSize = sizeof(std::uint32_t);

/// Whether a peer's declared element count is achievable in the bytes that remain.
///
/// **A declared count is a claim about bytes the frame must already contain.** It is
/// not a request, and it is not a size to allocate from -- it is an assertion that can
/// be checked, because every element costs at least some fixed number of bytes in this
/// grammar and the frame either carries them or it does not. It sits beside
/// `FieldPrefixSize` because that constant is usually the answer to @p minBytesEach.
///
/// This is the rule behind issue #267. Three decoders reserved container capacity from
/// a `u32` count with no such check, and the worst of them turned a **nine-byte** frame
/// into a request for roughly 172 GB -- reachable on the daemon's STORE path and from a
/// worker's reply to the launcher. `Protocol/CompileCacheWire.hpp` states the same
/// intent for a codec envelope's expansion field: the number exists so a decoder can
/// refuse an impossible claim before it allocates.
///
/// **It REFUSES; it does not clamp.** A clamping variant -- `reserve(min(count, cap))`
/// -- keeps a frame that is provably malformed alive and merely makes its allocation
/// smaller, so the decode fails later, deeper in, having already committed memory. The
/// refusal is the useful answer, and it is available to the caller precisely because
/// this returns a `bool` rather than a size. It also takes a REAL per-element cost
/// rather than assuming one byte, which is what makes the bound `remaining /
/// minBytesEach` instead of `remaining`.
///
/// **Necessary, and on its own not sufficient.** It bounds a count by the bytes
/// present, which still permits amplification when an in-memory element is much larger
/// than its wire minimum. A decoder therefore validates the claim with this AND sizes
/// any reservation from something it owns -- the bytes in hand, or its own configured
/// ceiling -- never from the peer's number alone.
///
/// The division is deliberate and is not a rearrangement of `count * minBytesEach`,
/// which is the overflowing spelling: at `u32` counts and any element size above one
/// byte the product wraps a 32-bit type and can wrap a 64-bit one, so the check would
/// pass on exactly the values it exists to refuse.

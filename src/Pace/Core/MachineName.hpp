/// (`cpu_busy_ratio`), so a script reading both had to know which surface it was on (#1445). Each table's names are
/// `static_assert`ed through here, so a row spelled any other way fails the build.

/// Whether the name @p parts join into is kebab-case: runs of `a`-`z` and `0`-`9`, each separated from the next by
/// exactly one `-`, with none at either end.
///
/// **The parts of a COMPOSED name** -- a tier, a separator, a column -- are judged as the one string they join
/// into, so a name no table holds whole (`memory-items`) meets the same walk as one that is, with nothing
/// allocated and inside a constant expression.
/// @param parts The pieces, in order; the name is their concatenation.
/// @return True when that name is non-empty and kebab-case.

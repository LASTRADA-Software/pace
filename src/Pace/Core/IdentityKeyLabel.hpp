///   transcript one field longer is another construction whatever its arity, since a
///   length-prefixed grammar separates fields and not field LISTS.
/// - `node-challenge-v2`, `node-proof-v2`: `node-proof-v1` was the pre-shared key's MAC label.
/// - `ticket-v1`: new with its construction (spec §5), and the label tickets were first signed
///   under, so routing them through this table moved no byte on the wire.
/// - `enroll-admission-v1`, `enroll-request-v1`: new with their constructions.
/// - `lease-v4`: the claims gained the granted worker's identity key (W-4), versioned with the

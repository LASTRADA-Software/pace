// Every readiness line this repository publishes is waited on by something this
// build does not recompile, so each is pinned by its BYTES below.
//
// ## Why a symbol both ends spell is not enough
//
// A wire constant has two facts, its name and its value, and a test that reads the
// constant can only check the first: change `ReadinessMarkerTable`'s text and every
// in-tree reader agrees with itself perfectly while every fixture stops matching.
// That is the rule `wire-and-protocol.md` states for an opcode, and these literals
// are in the same position -- the difference being that an opcode's other end is a
// deployed binary and this one's is four fixtures in two languages plus a workflow
// step.
//
// So the assertions below deliberately restate the literal. It looks like the code
// smell it is normally right to remove, and it is the anchor: it is the only thing
// in the repository that fails when the published text changes.
//
// ## What a failure here means
//
// Not "a string changed". It means the listed waiters are about to fail by TIMEOUT
// against a line nothing writes -- the slowest and least informative failure mode,
// each reported against whatever that fixture happened to be waiting for. If the
// reword is intended, every waiter named beside the assertion has to change in the
// same commit, and none of them is reached by this build.

/// **One type rather than four parameters, because the rule that governs the SET is a
/// compile-time one and a rule spread over a parameter list is a rule each new
/// parameter sits outside of**
/// ([#1051](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1051)).
///
/// The rule: a connection's coroutine frame can be DESTROYED rather than resumed. A
/// reactor that stops with a chain parked on it frees that chain from its own
/// destructor (#1025), and a destructor body runs before the members declared beside
/// it -- so by the time such a frame unwinds, every local declared after the reactor
/// in `ReactorServerLoop`'s serving functions is already gone. The listeners, the
/// servers, the expiry pool, the reaper and the per-bind `core::net::ITlsContext` are all in that
/// set.
///
/// **A destroyed coroutine frame runs no user code except destructors.** That is what
/// makes trivial destructibility the exact test here rather than a proxy for one: a
/// member that is only ever READ cannot be read by a frame nobody resumes, so a
/// pointer into a dead sibling is harmless in this specific window, while a member
/// whose destructor does anything at all is the one way the window can bite. So the
/// requirement is exactly *anything handed to a connection whose destructor does more
/// than nothing must outlive the reactor*, and the `static_assert` below is that
/// sentence with a reader.
///
/// The socket is the deliberate exemption and is a SEPARATE parameter so it cannot
/// hide inside the checked set. `~EpollSocket` / `~IocpSocket` call back into the
/// reactor, which is alive precisely because it is the object being destroyed.
///
/// What this does NOT cover, stated rather than left to be discovered: `Connection::Run`
/// builds its own locals -- a `SourceLogger`, a protocol handler, a `std::string` --
/// and holds them across suspension, and several have non-trivial destructors. They
/// are safe for a reason one level up rather than by this check: an object the
/// coroutine constructs itself can only own its own storage or reach what it was
/// GIVEN, and what it was given is this struct. Constraining the root set is therefore
/// what bounds the whole frame. A third constructor parameter would sit outside it,
/// which is why there are two and why widening the signature has to be a deliberate,
/// visible act.

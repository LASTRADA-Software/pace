/// Emits the daemon's readiness line once every acceptor is actually armed.
///
/// ## Why this is a type rather than one `Logf` call
///
/// `pace-kv` logged `ready, accepting connections` **before** starting a single
/// accept loop ([#646](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/646)).
/// Nothing observably broke -- the listen backlog covers the window -- and that is
/// exactly what made it worth fixing: the line reads like a readiness marker, so a
/// fixture author looking for one finds it, waits on it, and has been given a fact
/// **weaker than the bind they already had**. The failure is asymmetric in the
/// dangerous direction. Over-waiting costs seconds; under-waiting produces a test
/// that has never once exercised its property and is green throughout.
///
/// This repository has already paid for the same shape on the other binary: #634's
/// `compile node ready` changed from meaning *surveyed* to meaning *bound*, same
/// wording, different fact, and three include-tree walks silently stopped being
/// serialised.
///
/// So the line is emitted by the thing that knows every acceptor armed, and there is
/// no `Logf` at a call site for somebody to move back above the acceptors.
///
/// ## The expected count is REGISTERED, never computed
///
/// `ExpectAcceptor()` is called by the code that creates each participant, in the
/// same loop that creates it, and `AcceptorsAllSpawned()` closes the set. There is
/// deliberately no count parameter, because the two failure directions are not
/// symmetric and the arithmetic can only get the dangerous one wrong:
///
///   - A total too **low** announces early. That is #646 again, mild, and visible.
///   - A total too **high** means the announcement **never fires at all**. The line
///     never appears, and two out-of-tree waiters plus a CI step block on it -- a
///     hang, behind a line a green suite says nothing about.
///
/// A number derived by hand from two other numbers (`binds.size() + reactorCount`,
/// say) can disagree with what actually started; a count incremented where the
/// participant is created cannot. So the type offers no way to state a total.
///
/// ## And it cannot end silently
///
/// If this object is destroyed having never announced, it says so, naming how many
/// of how many armed. A readiness contract that can quietly never fire is worse than
/// one that fires early, because early is at least observable -- so the one state
/// with no log line of its own is the one state this must not be able to reach.
///
/// ## Why it counts rather than being called once at the end
///
/// Only one of the three server loops has a place where "the acceptors have started"
/// is a statement one thread can make. On POSIX with `--threads N` each reactor arms
/// its own accept loops on its own thread and then blocks in `Run()`, and on Windows
/// each bind gets an acceptor thread of its own. Whoever arms **last** is the only
/// caller that can announce, and which thread that is changes from run to run -- so
/// the count decides, and the announcement happens on whichever thread brings it home.
///
/// ## The wording is a contract with things outside this repository
///
/// `bench/runner.py` (`READY_MARKER`) and the packaging job in
/// `.github/workflows/build.yml` both wait on the literal substring
/// `ready, accepting connections`. This change makes that substring name a *stronger*
/// fact and deliberately does not reword it, so neither waiter needs to change and
/// neither silently starts waiting on something else.

///   1. the bind-flag shape (`ValidateBindFlagShape`): the legacy single-bind flags beside
///      `--listen` would silently vanish;
///   2. the keyspace-event grammar (`ParseKeyspaceEvents`), which the body parses again;
///   3. every other rule decided by the configuration and the build alone
///      (`DaemonStartupRejection`).
///
/// A function of its own, and in the library rather than in `main`, because `main` is in no test
/// target: the gate was a bare `if` there that nothing could hold to its table.
/// @param outcome What the command line asked for.
/// @param assembled The effective configuration, as `AssembleEffectiveConfig` built it.
/// @return The refusal's words, or nothing when this outcome may proceed.

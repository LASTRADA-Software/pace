/// **A close with the peer's bytes still unread is an RST, not a FIN**, and an RST
/// destroys what the peer had not read yet. Measured on loopback (#1553): Windows drops
/// every byte already buffered for the reader and reports the reset at once; Linux and
/// macOS hand those bytes over first. So a server that answers a request it did not
/// finish reading -- a `431` over a head past its cap, a `-ERR Protocol error` over a
/// value past its limit, a `408` to a head that dribbled -- and then closes, delivers
/// that answer to a Linux client and a reset to a Windows one. The refusal is the whole
/// point of answering at all, and it was lost exactly where it was aimed.
///
/// So the close lingers, the way web servers have for decades: half-close first, so the
/// answer is followed by a FIN and a well-behaved peer closes on reading it; discard what
/// the peer is still sending; close once it has closed, or once the bounds say stop. A
/// peer that closed first costs ONE read, which reports EOF or the reset at once -- so an
/// ordinary goodbye is never turned into a wait, and the outcome says so. A peer
/// that keeps sending past the bounds meets the reset anyway -- bounded best effort, and
/// never a promise to read an unbounded upload in order to refuse it.
///
/// A socket that is already closed is only closed again, which is a no-op.
/// @param socket The socket to close; must outlive the task.
/// @param reactor Where a reactor socket's deadline is armed, or nullptr for a blocking
///        or in-memory one.
/// @param bounds How long and how much to listen.
/// @return A task that completes once the socket is closed, with how the linger ended.

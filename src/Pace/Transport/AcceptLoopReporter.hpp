/// **What a failed accept MEANS is core-cpp's** (`<core/net/AcceptPolicy.hpp>`, graduated from this
/// tree at 0.6.0): only a closed or dead listener ends a loop; one connection's failure is accepted
/// past, exhaustion is backed off on, and a failure nothing classifies is backed off on without end
/// and reported as the loop being degraded if it persists. **What it is REPORTED as is this tree's**,
/// and it is one class rather than five copies, because the five loops -- the node's 0xFC surface,
/// the Raft peer server, the admin surface, the daemon's cache binds and its Windows acceptor
/// threads -- must agree: a line at the same level, and one entry in the process's one registry
/// (`core::net::AcceptLoopHealth`) that `/healthz` and the node's conditions read.

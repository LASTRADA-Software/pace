/// drives is `core::net::listen`, bound as `ClientListenOptions` says. What core-cpp does not
/// offer, and this file does, is a listener a thread BLOCKS on: `BlockingListener` for the admin
/// endpoints, and `AcceptRaw` for the Windows multi-reactor's accept thread. Both are candidates
/// for graduation into core-cpp; until then they are this file, and nothing else in this tree
/// binds.
///
/// **Exclusive**, exactly as core-cpp's listeners: `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` on Windows, where
/// `SO_REUSEADDR` would let a second process take a port already being served, and `SO_REUSEADDR`
/// on POSIX, where it only steps over a dead socket's TIME_WAIT. A port several loops share is
/// `core::net::PortSharing::Shared`, which only `core::net::listen` binds.
///
/// **Every listener here states a queue DEPTH** (`ListenQueue.hpp`), and the two places this file
/// hands a backlog on -- `ListenOptions::backlog` and `::listen` -- spell it for the platform, since
/// a plain number asks Windows for at most about 200 whatever it says (#1679).

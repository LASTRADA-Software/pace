/// **Not the limited broadcast.** `255.255.255.255` leaves by whichever interface the stack infers,
/// and on a Windows host with a VPN-type adapter that was the adapter -- measured: source
/// `172.31.255.2`, not the LAN's `192.168.86.24/24` -- so a default node beaconed where no LAN peer
/// ever heard it. A directed broadcast is ON-LINK: it leaves by its own interface, with that
/// interface's address as its source, which is also what keeps a discovery cookie's host binding
/// true of an honest peer (`ChallengeCookies`): it answers from the address it was challenged at.
///
/// **Re-enumerated on an INTERVAL, never per beacon**: the enumeration costs a syscall, two orders
/// of magnitude dearer on Windows (`QueryLocalAddresses`' measurement), and a beacon is sent every
/// few seconds. Stale in both directions, and both degrade safely:
/// - A link that came UP since the last refresh is not beaconed on until the next: for up to one
///   interval peers there do not hear THIS node, while it still hears them -- receiving is on the
///   wildcard, whatever this answers.
/// - A link that went DOWN, or changed address, is still beaconed at its old broadcast until the
///   next: datagrams to nobody, or to a subnet this node has left. A beacon is an unauthenticated
///   announcement, and whatever answers it is proven, so a stale send costs a datagram.
///
/// **Never a silent no-op**: a refresh that finds no eligible interface says so, naming each
/// interface and why it was passed over, with the remedy -- and says again when one comes back.
///
/// **A walk that FAILED is not a machine with no interfaces.** It keeps the destinations it had --
/// the staleness above, which degrades safely -- and says so naming the error: counted per new
/// error, said at most once per `WalkFailureReportInterval`. Its end is said -- where beacons go,
/// whether or not that changed -- only once no walk has failed for a whole interval, so a walk
/// that fails every other time is one line, not a Warn and an Info per two refreshes.

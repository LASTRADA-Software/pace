/// An answer is worth something only against a nonce the asker chose and has not spent. A plain
/// `Nonce` says neither: any caller can build one with any bytes, and copy it to check a second
/// answer against. So what a fleet probe verifies an answer against is an `IssuedNonce` -- drawn by
/// `ChallengeIssuer` from the injected generator, never built by hand, never copied, and spent by
/// the verification that takes it, whatever that decides. Discovery's challenges are not issued
/// here: they are cookies, which no table holds (`ChallengeCookies`).

/// A nonce this node drew for ONE question and has not yet checked an answer against: the

/// **Move-only, and a move EMPTIES the source.** The nonce is held in an `optional` that a move
/// hands on and disengages, so the source holds nothing and is `Spent()`. A defaulted move would not
/// do that: an `optional`'s move leaves the source engaged, and the nonce is an array, whose move is
/// a copy -- so the source would keep a nonce able to verify a second answer. Emptiness rather than
/// a flag beside the nonce, so there is one state and not two to keep in step, and reading a spent
/// nonce is an access to an empty `optional`, which the analyser refuses unless the reader asked
/// first. **And only `ChallengeIssuer` makes one**, so an answer is verified only against a nonce
/// this process drew: a recorded nonce is bytes, and no bytes make an `IssuedNonce`, so a recorded
/// answer cannot be replayed against its recorded question. Consumed BY VALUE by
/// `ProvenFleetSummary::VerifyAnswer`, whatever it decides.

/// What a node signs when it answers a joiner -- an admission, a refusal or a "not yet" -- and the
/// one check of that signature.
///
/// An admission's roster is PUBLIC: every member's id and key, which every beacon and summary
/// already carries. So no check of its content can tell the fleet's answer from anybody's who
/// answered at the endpoint polled -- a roster listing the proven key and the joiner is a copy of
/// public facts. What binds an answer to the fleet is a signature the joiner can verify, by a key
/// it has itself PROVEN for that fleet, over a nonce it chose for that one request.
///
/// **Every outcome is signed, not only the admission**: a refusal sends a joiner back to solitary
/// for an hour and a "not yet" keeps it from giving a dead join up, so an unsigned one is a lever
/// anybody at the polled endpoint could pull. The outcome is inside what is signed, so one answer's
/// signature is never another's.

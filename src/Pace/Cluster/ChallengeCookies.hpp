/// @file ChallengeCookies.hpp
/// Discovery's challenges, held by NOTHING: each nonce is a MAC over who it was sent to, so a
/// proof carries back everything needed to judge it and no table waits on an answer.
///
/// A table of outstanding challenges is a table a beacon grows, and a beacon is unauthenticated:
/// anything on the segment can name any cluster and any node. Every bound on such a table is spent
/// by displacing somebody, and whoever is displaced is a real peer as soon as the flood is fast
/// enough -- four spoofed ids of another fleet displaced that fleet's challenge before it could
/// answer. So there is no table. The nonce a challenge carries is a COOKIE this node can recompute:
/// a serial, then a MAC under a key this node drew, over the serial, this node's cluster, the
/// cluster, node and endpoint the challenge was sent to, and the HOST it was sent to. The proof
/// echoes it; this node recomputes it from what the proof claims and the host the proof ARRIVED
/// from, and a proof that names anything other than what was challenged, or comes from anywhere
/// but where the challenge went, names a cookie this node never made. Checking that costs one
/// HMAC, BEFORE any signature and before any budget.
///
/// **The host binds a cookie to an address its answerer OWNS.** Without it, a flood collects real
/// cookies at its own address and answers them from as many source addresses as it can type, each
/// a fresh per-source budget -- so the per-source bound was a bound per TYPED address, and forged
/// proofs over real cookies drained the shared check budget before an honest proof arrived (the
/// reviewer's P9). Bound to the destination, a spoofed-source answer fails the HMAC; a forger has
/// to receive the challenge at every address it answers from. The assumption this rests on, and
/// states: **an honest peer answers from the address it was challenged at.** Discovery is
/// LAN-local and answers from the socket it beaconed from, so no NAT stands between the two.
///
/// A cookie never REPEATS, which is the property a nonce needs (`Core/Nonce.hpp`): the serial is
/// unique within this process, and the key is drawn afresh by every process and every epoch.

/// **A state for EVERY issued cookie, so the record is never full.** Serials are issued in order, so
/// an epoch keeps two bits per serial it issued: unanswered, forged once, exhausted, or spent. An
/// epoch issues at most `MaxEpochChallenges` and then a new key is drawn at the next challenge, so
/// its record is a fixed bitmap every cookie it issued has a place in. A record with a capacity
/// below what was issued was a race again: a flood of VERIFIED proofs under a key of the attacker's
/// own, answering cookies it collected, filled it before an honest proof arrived, which was then
/// refused (the reviewer's P8). Filling a bitmap is not possible; forcing the two rotations that
/// would expire an honest cookie inside one round trip takes twice `MaxEpochChallenges` challenges.
///
/// **Spent once VERIFIED.** A cookie that answered a proof whose signature verified is recorded as
/// spent until its epoch is let go, so a recorded proof cannot be replayed inside its window. A
/// proof that did NOT verify does not spend it: it proves nothing about the cookie, and spending on
/// it would let a forger who saw a challenge go out destroy the honest answer at once. It is
/// COUNTED instead, and after `MaxForgeriesPerChallenge` failed checks the cookie is exhausted --
/// so a cookie buys a bounded number of signature checks however many sources name it, and what
/// a forger racing the honest answer buys is that one challenge, re-asked at the next beacon.

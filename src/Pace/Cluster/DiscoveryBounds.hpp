/// Every bound on what an unauthenticated datagram can make discovery hold or sign, as ONE table.
///
/// A beacon is unauthenticated by construction: anything on the segment can send one, naming any
/// cluster and any node, from any source address. So every table a beacon grows is BOUNDED, and the
/// bound is spent in one way everywhere: **what the roster or an answered challenge vouches for is
/// kept; at the bound, the OLDEST entry nothing vouches for is displaced.** Refusing the newcomer
/// instead would let a few spoofed datagrams a second hold a table full forever and keep every real
/// peer or fleet out of it; displacing the oldest makes a spoofer race the real peer's round trip.
/// Every displacement and every drop is counted (`DiscoveryBeaconsOverBound`).
///
/// **No table holds an outstanding challenge**: a challenge's nonce is a cookie this node
/// recomputes from the proof (`ChallengeCookies`), so a flood of invented ids has nothing to
/// displace. What a key epoch DOES keep is a two-bit state for every cookie it issued -- answered,
/// forged at, spent -- so it issues at most `MaxEpochChallenges` before a new key is drawn, and its
/// record is never full for a cookie it issued.
///
/// The WORK BUDGETS bound signature work rather than memory (`WorkBudgets`): answering a challenge
/// costs this node a signing, and checking a proof whose cookie holds costs it a verification. Each
/// is rate-limited twice -- per SOURCE host, in a table of at most `MaxBudgetedSources` hosts, then
/// all together. Past either, the work is not done, and the next beacon round asks again.

/// The one fleet an operator allowed this node to belong to (`--fleet-id`), and the one predicate
/// every formation decision asks of it.
///
/// **Zero-config discovery is trust-on-first-use.** A fleet's proof binds a KEY, never the truth of
/// its summary (`ProvenFleetSummary`), and a key costs nothing: anybody on the segment can mint one
/// and prove "established, created at 0", and every solitary node that hears it would yield to it,
/// enroll, and on its approval adopt its roster -- dispatching its launchers' source to that fleet's
/// workers and compiling that fleet's jobs.
///
/// **The pin is a KEY pin, because a cluster id is a name.** Every beacon carries the id, so a pin by
/// name alone stops nobody who can hear the fleet it names: a machine on that very segment proves a
/// fleet CLAIMING the id under a key of its own. So a pin names the cluster AND the identity keys of
/// its voters -- an office has one or two, so listing them is cheap and no chain of trust is needed --
/// and what a pinned node accepts on its way INTO its fleet is what one of those keys SIGNED: the
/// summary it yields to, every answer to its `Enroll`, the leader it is redirected to, the admission
/// its record keeps. **It anchors the JOIN**: once joined, the fleet's applied state is the authority,
/// as for any member, so a capture of the fleet's quorum after the join is not something a pin sees.

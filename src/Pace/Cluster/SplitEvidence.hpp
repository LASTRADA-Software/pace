/// Whether a proven fleet of another cluster is THIS fleet split in two, decided only on a fact a key
/// this fleet already held verifies.
///
/// Two fleets that each admitted a machine of the other -- a one-sided or mutual admission, or a
/// network split that formed on both sides -- are one fleet. But a proven summary's member list is its
/// speaker's CLAIM: the signature proves who spoke, not what it records, and ids ride every beacon.
/// Believed on its own, a fleet claiming to be older and listing this fleet's leader would make an
/// established fleet dissolve into whoever minted it -- a one-beacon takeover. So a split is
/// recognised on exactly two facts, each tied to a key this side held BEFORE the encounter:
///
/// - **(A) Their speaker is our member**: recorded in this fleet's state under the id it speaks as,
///   WITH the key it proved. Forging it needs that member's private key. This is what the side that
///   RECORDED the other's machine sees.
/// - **(C) We asked them, and they list us**: a machine of this fleet once asked that fleet to admit
///   it, under the key that proves this summary now, and the summary names that machine. This is what
///   the side that was RECORDED sees.
///
/// **Only (A) by a VOTER heals by itself** (`SplitEvidenceRow::healing`). (C) is trust on FIRST USE: a
/// solitary machine asks whichever fleet beaconed oldest, so the key behind a memo is one anybody who
/// beacons can have it hold -- and a fleet that refused the asker, never answered it, or admitted it and
/// then dissolved itself away leaves the same memo as a real split does. A learner's key is first-use
/// trust too, since auto-approval admits learners. Both are READ and told to an operator, as
/// `fleet-split-healing`; neither moves a fleet.

/// empty. Hosts compare through `SameHost`, and the result is joined by `FormatHostPort`, so an IPv6
/// literal keeps its brackets. A seat that is not dialled (a learner) is never coupled: its leftover
/// Raft endpoint is nobody's to dial, and moving it would record a port nobody listens on. Hosts

/// The keys a node's Raft peer wire is proved with: its own pair, and what the cluster says
/// every other member proves itself with (#178).
///
/// ## Two sources, and which one wins
///
/// - **The bootstrap members** -- the roster its formation record starts it from -- are what a node knows
///   before the cluster has told it anything. They are the only keys a cluster that has not
///   yet elected can verify, so a fresh cluster whose members were given none cannot form, and
///   says so in its refusal counters rather than trusting whoever answers first.
/// - **The replicated state** (`ClusterState::members` and `revokedKeys`) is what the cluster
///   agreed, and it WINS wherever it says anything: a member re-admitted under a new key is
///   proved with the new one whatever a command line typed a year ago.
///
/// A bootstrap key the state has REVOKED is revoked, whatever the command line says: a
/// revocation that a restart with the original command line could undo would be removal
/// failing open. A member the state does not record falls back to its bootstrap key only when
/// that key is not revoked.
///
/// ## A forgotten member keeps its key here until the configuration drops it
///
/// A forget revokes a member's key in the committed entry, and the configuration stops
/// counting the member a reconcile pass LATER (`Cluster::NextQuorumChange`, #1555). Cut off
/// at the revocation, the member would be a counted voter that can no longer vote for that
/// pass -- and a cluster losing one more voter inside it can WEDGE for good: four voters, one
/// forgotten and cut off, the leader lost, leaves two of four, which elects nobody, so nobody
/// ever proposes the removal that would have made two a majority. So a key revoked under an
/// id stays live FOR THAT ID while this node's configuration counts it (`AdoptConfiguration`),
/// and is refused the moment the configuration drops it -- which is Raft's own rule for a
/// removed server, stated about keys. Nothing else is graced: the same key under any other id
/// is refused, and a forgotten member the configuration never counted is refused at once.
///
/// ## Every revoked key, whatever id is asked about
///
/// `KeysOf` hands back EVERY key the state has revoked, not the ones revoked under the id asked
/// about. The id a revocation carries is whose the key WAS (`RevokedKey`), and a removed machine
/// may claim whatever id it likes. Filtering on that id would report n3 claiming another id as
/// a key nobody gave, when it is the removed machine itself. The list decides a diagnosis and
/// never an acceptance: a revoked key is refused whatever id it claims, because only the id's
/// live key proves it. The cost is one signature check per revoked key on a proof that did not
/// verify under the live key. That is bounded by the keys an operator has ever revoked, as
/// `revokedKeys` is, and never by traffic.
///
/// Thread-safe: the reactor's handshakes and every frame's re-check read it while the state
/// machine's apply thread writes it.

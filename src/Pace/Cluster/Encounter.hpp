/// What a node does when it meets another fleet, as one pure decision both sides compute alike.
///
/// Two machines that each bootstrapped a solitary cluster and then see each other must end as ONE
/// fleet, so exactly one of them yields -- and each decides on its own, with no message saying which.
/// That works only because the decision is a function of the two summaries alone, and orders them
/// the same way from either side: whatever one node concludes about the pair, the other concludes
/// the mirror of it.
///
/// **The seen side is a `ProvenFleetSummary`, never a bare `FleetSummary`.** These functions trust
/// every field they are given, and a beacon is unauthenticated by construction: deciding on one
/// would let a single spoofed datagram claiming an older fleet make a node yield. So the seen
/// summary is a type only a verified signature produces, and a raw beacon cannot be passed at all.
/// Proven means the signer holds its key, not that what it says is true; see `ProvenFleetSummary`.
///
/// **Two established fleets decide only on SPLIT EVIDENCE**, the third input, and only on the kind
/// that HEALS AUTOMATICALLY. Two fleets proven to be one fleet split in two heal by the same tiebreak;
/// two that share nothing are foreign and neither moves. What tells them apart is never the seen
/// fleet's member list alone -- anybody can mint a fleet listing any id -- but a fact a key this fleet
/// already held verifies (`SplitEvidenceFor`). And only a VOTER's key moves a fleet on its own: the
/// other kinds rest on a key this fleet came to hold on somebody's first-use trust, so they are told
/// to an operator and decide nothing (`SplitEvidenceRow::healing`).
///
/// **A pending node is a POINTER, never a fleet to join.** It has asked another fleet to take it, so
/// its own cluster ends when that fleet admits it; a node yielding to it would be left in a cluster
/// nobody runs. Its summary names the fleet it asked (`FleetState::Pending`), and a solitary node
/// meeting one is told to `Follow`: ask that fleet for itself and decide on what IT proves, exactly
/// as if its own beacon had arrived. Nothing is yielded to on the pointer's word alone.

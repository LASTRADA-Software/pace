/// `WorkerRegistry` and `LeaseTable` are pure -- every rule below is a table-driven unit

/// because this node has more than one: its own record, which only it can supply,
/// and the peers discovery has proved. Two callers each deciding "is this already
/// there?" would be two places for the answer to drift.
///
/// ## What it never proposes
///
/// **A removal.** A member vanishes from what this node can see for reasons that are
/// almost never "it left": a beacon lost on a broadcast, a switch rebooting, a laptop
/// closed for an hour. Removing on absence would take a node out of the quorum the
/// moment the network hiccupped, and a cluster that re-computes its own membership
/// from reachability is one that can shrink itself below a majority and never come
/// back. Raft already tolerates a member that does not answer; leaving is an operator
/// decision, and stays one.
///
/// **A record that already matches.** Proposing one costs a log entry, a replication
/// round and a snapshot's worth of growth per beacon interval, forever. So the
/// comparison is on the *whole* record rather than on the id -- a member whose
/// scheduler endpoint has just been announced differs from the one recorded, and must
/// be re-proposed, while one that agrees in every field must not.
///
/// **A seat something else placed.** A recorded member keeps the seat the operator's
/// verb wrote, so neither this node's own record nor a rediscovered peer promotes a
/// demotion back or demotes a promotion. One recorded nowhere but counted by @p active
/// -- a bootstrap member, which nothing puts in the state -- is recorded in the set
/// consensus already counts it in, so recording a bootstrap voter never demotes it. Only a
/// member neither places is a newcomer, and it joins as `NewcomerSeat`: a learner, which
/// an operator promotes (#1535).
///
/// ## What it refuses to propose
///
/// **A record for an id the cluster has FORGOTTEN (#1528, #1555).** Everything this
/// function is handed is an OBSERVATION -- a peer proved its key, this node knows its own
/// record -- and a forget is an operator's positive act, so an observation must not undo
/// one. It would, and silently: `--cluster-forget` leaves the machine running and a
/// machine always desires its own record, so the next pass would put the member back and
/// the quorum would flap -- removed on one pass, re-added on the next.
///
/// A forget revokes the id's key, and that revocation is what this asks: a desire for an
/// id `revokedKeys` names is refused, WHEREVER it now dials from -- an address is not an
/// identity, so no host enters into it. A forget always leaves one (`PrepareForget`
/// refuses one that would revoke nothing), and a member is never admitted without a key
/// (`ValidateAgainst`), so there is no forgotten member this cannot see.
///
/// Decided HERE, against the state, and not by forgetting the desire: whatever holds the
/// desire hands it back at the next pass, for as long as it runs. Asked only of a desire
/// that would propose something -- one the state already matches changes nothing. It
/// covers this node's OWN record too: a leader that was forgotten stops re-proposing
/// itself, and proposes its own removal instead (`NextQuorumChange`, #1539).
///
/// **Undoing a forget is the operator's, and it is deliberate**: `--cluster-admit`
/// commits `AddMember` directly -- never through this function -- under a NEW key, since
/// the revoked one is never admitted again (`KeyRevoked`). After it the id is recorded
/// again, and a desire for it passes once more -- unless it still carries the revoked key,
/// which is the forgotten machine whatever the record now says.

/// safety rules. Until this existed the second answer never moved: a node
/// admitted at runtime was served by every surface and voted in none, so growing a
/// cluster's consensus meant restarting its members with a longer bootstrap list.
///
/// ## One change, and which one
///
/// A configuration change may add, remove, promote **or** demote exactly one member
/// (§4.3, and `Consensus::Membership::Classify`), so this returns one step and is
/// called again when it commits. Additions come first -- into whichever set the
/// member's record names -- then promotions, then demotions, then removals: growing
/// the voter set before shrinking it keeps the quorum reachable while a replacement is
/// in progress, where the other order passes through a configuration that is smaller
/// than either endpoint.
///
/// ## Learners (#1449)
///
/// A learner is proposed, moved and removed on the same terms as a voter, with one
/// difference that follows from what it is: adding one changes no quorum, so it is
/// always safe -- and it still waits for a dialable address, since a member nothing
/// can replicate to never catches up. A demotion or removal that would leave no voter
/// is never proposed: a configuration nobody is counted in can commit nothing,
/// including the change that would undo it.
///
/// ## A voter is counted only once it has caught up (#1537)
///
/// **Every member enters the configuration as a learner**, whatever its record names,
/// and one recorded as a voter is PROMOTED -- a second change -- once it is dialable
/// AND its match index has reached the commit index (`Replication::CaughtUp`). The
/// record still says voter throughout; only consensus is staged, which is Raft's own
/// answer (§4.2.1: catch a new server up before it is counted). Counted before it has
/// caught up, a voter that is away makes every commit wait for it: in a one-voter
/// cluster the promotion itself needs both machines, so nothing after it commits until
/// it returns -- reproduced, before this rule, by promoting an absent learner.
///
/// It covers an operator's promotion of a learner and an admission of a fresh voter
/// alike, since both are the member being COUNTED. It is not a decision about WHETHER
/// to promote -- that is the operator's (#1535) -- only about WHEN the promotion may
/// take effect. A member waiting for it is named in `QuorumPlan::catchingUp`.
///
/// **A learner is never removed for being absent**, which is the property bootstrap
/// members already have below, and for the same reason: nothing here asks whether a
/// member ANSWERS. Only a member the operator forgot -- gone from the state, admitted
/// at runtime -- is removed, whichever set it is in.
///
/// ## What it refuses to propose
///
/// **A member with no dialable address.** Counting a node the transport cannot
/// reach is precisely the failure this whole change exists to avoid, reached from
/// the other side: the cluster's quorum grows and the votes to satisfy it cannot
/// arrive. A member already *counted* is never dropped for this, though — an
/// endpoint that has become unreadable is a bad record, and shrinking the quorum
/// over one would turn a typo into a cluster that cannot elect. A dialable address
/// is necessary and not sufficient: the votes have to be able to arrive NOW, which is
/// the catch-up rule above.
///
/// **This node's own removal -- until the operator forgets it (#1539).** A leader
/// taking itself out of the quorum it leads is an operator's decision, and absent a
/// forget it would not stick anyway: a node always desires its own record, so the
/// next pass would propose putting it back, and a configuration flapping on a timer
/// is worse than one that is merely wrong.
///
/// A forget IS that decision, and it means the same thing whoever currently leads. A
/// leader whose own record is gone AND whose key the cluster has revoked -- what
/// `Forget` writes, and the one reading of *forgotten*
/// that the first pass of a fresh leader, which has recorded nothing yet, cannot
/// produce -- stops re-proposing its record (`MembershipProposals`, #1528) and proposes its
/// own removal, LAST: after every other change it can still make as the leader.
/// Once that commits it steps down (`RaftNode`, §4.2.2 -- #1449's demoted leader is
/// the same rule), and the remaining voters elect a leader that never admits it
/// again. Never the last voter: a configuration nobody is counted in can commit
/// nothing, and forgetting the only voter is refused BY NAME before anything is
/// proposed (`PrepareForget`), so the record never runs ahead of a quorum that
/// could not follow it.
///
/// Its own bootstrap entry does not protect it, for a reason that holds only for
/// this one entry: a node cannot start without naming itself, so that entry records
/// how it was started, not an operator's assertion about who belongs. Every OTHER
/// member this node's command line names is still such an assertion -- until the
/// cluster forgets it, which outranks it (below).
///
/// **A forgotten member leaves the quorum, whoever typed it (#1555).** A forget revokes
/// the key the member was admitted under, and on the consensus wire that takes effect when
/// the configuration stops counting the member: until then it keeps its key for itself
/// (`RosterKeys`), because cutting a counted voter off could leave a quorum nobody can
/// reach. So a forgotten member this policy KEPT would go on voting for as long as it runs
/// -- the forget failing open on the wire it most concerns. Whoever leads therefore
/// removes a counted member that is recorded nowhere and that `revokedKeys` names, with a
/// bootstrap set or without one. That is not absence read as removal: the
/// revocation is the forget's own record, which nothing else writes and a fresh leader's
/// empty state cannot contain. A forget that would leave no revocation is refused before
/// it is proposed (`PrepareForget`).
///
/// **The removal of a bootstrap member.** This is the one that is not obvious, and
/// getting it wrong shrinks a healthy cluster to one node: the bootstrap set puts a
/// member in the *configuration* and nothing puts it in the *state*, so on a cluster
/// whose members were bootstrapped rather than admitted, `state.members` holds the leader's
/// own record and nothing else. Read as "everybody else was forgotten", that
/// proposes removing every peer, one per commit, until the leader is alone and
/// refuses the others as strangers — which is what it did, exactly once, before
/// @p bootstrap existed.
///
/// So absence means removal only for a member that was **admitted at runtime**,
/// which is what tells "the operator forgot it" apart from "nobody ever wrote it
/// down". A bootstrap member is a member by the record it was started from, and
/// taking it out of the quorum is an operator's decision -- a forget, never absence.
///
/// The bootstrap set rather than a record of what this process has observed, and
/// the difference is a restart. An observation is rebuilt from live members only, so
/// a fleet restarted after a removal — a rolling restart, or one rebuilt from its
/// command lines — would count a forgotten member forever, with a correct-looking
/// member set and nothing logged. The bootstrap set comes off the command line and
/// says the same thing after every start.
///
/// **A node given no bootstrap set removes no member merely for being absent**, which
/// is the same rule read at its limit rather than an exception to it -- a FORGOTTEN one
/// it removes, above. A node that joined a fleet was
/// told nothing about the cluster's shape, so every member is equally unexplained to
/// it — and once such a node is elected it would otherwise remove all of them, one
/// per commit, which is the identical failure the parameter exists to prevent
/// reached through the one path that has nothing to compare against. What it costs
/// is that a fleet whose only bootstrapped node is gone can no longer shrink its
/// quorum until one leads again; it fails closed, counting a member too many rather
/// than too few.

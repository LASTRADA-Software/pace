/// **Per source first, then shared, and the order is the point.** A source that has spent its own
/// burst is refused BEFORE the shared budget is asked, so one host flooding from a real address
/// drains only its own bucket and every other peer's work still comes out of a full shared one.
/// Asked the other way round, each of the flood's datagrams would take a shared token on its way to
/// its own refusal. A flood that varies its source ADDRESS gets a fresh bucket per address and meets
/// the shared budget, which is what bounds the work.

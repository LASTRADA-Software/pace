/// multi-megabyte objects written constantly are the opposite of both.
///
/// ## Idempotence across restarts
///
/// `IRaftStateMachine` documents that a recovered node re-applies from the start of
/// whatever log it holds, because the commit index is not durable. This machine is
/// naturally idempotent — every command is a set-or-replace, and re-applying a
/// prefix reaches the same state — but the *observer* below is not something a
/// caller may assume is called once per change. It is called whenever the state
/// moves, including during that replay, so it must be cheap and must not be a place

/// @file EnrollRequestSignature.hpp
/// What a joiner signs when it asks to be admitted, and the one check of that signature.
///
/// An `Enroll` names an id and a key, and both are PUBLIC: a discovery beacon carries the key and
/// the roster names both. Unsigned, any host could poll under a joiner's id and key with an endpoint
/// of its own, and the leader recorded whichever poll came last before the approval -- an endpoint
/// the operator never saw, beside a key that matched. So the request is signed by the key it asks
/// under, over every field it states, and the leader verifies it before it records or refreshes
/// anything: only the key's holder can say where its machine answers.
///
/// **And it is FRESH for the leader**: a refresh signs over the challenge the leader's last `Pending`
/// answer issued for that row (`EnrollRequest::challenge`), which the refresh replaces -- so a
/// request recorded on the way and replayed later answers a challenge the row no longer holds, and
/// moves nothing. A first ask carries none; it creates a row, which moves nothing that was there.

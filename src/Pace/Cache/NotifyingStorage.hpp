/// IStorage decorator that fires `IStorageMutationObserver::OnMutation`
/// after every successful key-level mutation on the inner storage.
///
/// Centralising notification at this layer fixes three correctness
/// bugs that scattered per-handler emission caused:
///
///   1. Memcached writes (`set`, `add`, `replace`, `delete`, `cas`,
///      `incr`/`decr`, `append`/`prepend`, `flush_all`) used to bypass
///      WATCH dirty signals entirely. A Redis WATCH'd key mutated by a
///      concurrent memcached client silently committed the watching
///      client's EXEC. (Only the WATCH half: memcached writes still fire
///      no keyspace events, because memcached has no convention for them
///      and the Redis handlers own the per-verb names. See
///      `docs/operations/known-limitations.md`.)
///
///   2. Storage-internal events — a TTL found lapsed during a lookup or a
///      sweep, an LRU tail dropped under memory pressure — never fired
///      WATCH dirties or `__keyevent@0__:expired` / `:evicted` events, so
///      watched keys that vanished under TTL pressure passed an EXEC the
///      WATCH should have aborted. The tiers now name what they reclaim
///      (`IReclaimLog`), this decorator drains that once their call has
///      returned, and `RedisMutationObserver` publishes it.
///
///      Reclamation also runs on a timer, so a key that lapses and is
///      never touched again is still reported: `ExpiryReaper` drives a
///      bounded `PurgeExpired` from the reactor. Without it expiry was
///      entirely access-driven — and with the default `Approximate` LRU a
///      read does not erase either, so an untouched key was never reported
///      at all.
///
///   3. `FLUSHDB` / `flush_all` wiped the entire keyspace without
///      firing the canonical `__keyevent@0__:flushdb` event or
///      dirtying any WATCH'd keys.
///
/// Because the decorator sits BELOW the protocol handler in the storage
/// chain (typically wrapped around `LayeredStorage` or `ShardedStorage`),
/// every protocol pays the notification cost exactly once per mutation,
/// regardless of which wire the request came in on.
///
/// The observer pointer may be `nullptr` to disable notifications
/// (cheap: every call short-circuits on the null check before the inner
/// call). When non-null, the observer's own `HasObservers()` fast probe
/// is consulted to skip the OnMutation call when nothing is listening —
/// keeping the steady-state overhead to a single atomic load on the
/// hot write path.

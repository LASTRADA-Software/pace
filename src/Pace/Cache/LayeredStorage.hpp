/// Two-tier storage that fronts a canonical lower tier with an in-memory
/// LRU cache. Reads hit L1 first; on a miss they fall through to L2 and
/// the returned entry is mirrored into L1 with **L2's CAS preserved**, so
/// the in-memory mirror always agrees with the canonical store on
/// identity. Writes are write-through: L2 is mutated first (canonical CAS
/// issued there) and the resulting entry is mirrored into L1 verbatim.
///
/// L1 is held as a concrete `InMemoryLruStorage` (not a polymorphic
/// `IStorage`) so this class can use `InsertVerbatim` to mirror an entry
/// with a pre-chosen CAS — the public `IStorage::Set` always issues a
/// fresh CAS, which would break coherency. Future tiering generalisations
/// can templatise on the L1 type.
///
/// ## Operation semantics
///
/// | Op | Behaviour |
/// |---|---|
/// | `Get`            | L1 first; on L1 miss, try L2 and on hit mirror to L1 preserving L2's CAS. |
/// | `Set`            | L2 first (canonical CAS); mirror to L1 verbatim. |
/// | `Add` / `Replace`| Routed to L2 (the canonical store) for existence checks; mirror result to L1. |
/// | `Append`/`Prepend`/`CompareAndSwap`/`IncrementOrInitialize` | Same — L2 enforces semantics; mirror outcome to L1. |
/// | `Delete`         | L2.Delete; always drop from L1 (best effort). |
/// | `FlushWithGeneration` | Forward to both (each maintains its own gen). |
/// | `PurgeExpired`   | Forward the same budget to both; L2's counts are canonical. |
/// | `Snapshot`       | itemCount/bytesUsed/bytesLimit from L2; LayeredStorage tracks its own
/// cmdGet/cmdSet/getHits/getMisses. |
///
/// ## Concurrency
///
/// Not internally thread-safe. Intended to live inside one shard of a
/// `ShardedStorage`, whose per-shard `unique_lock` serialises all calls
/// into this object. Sharding **outside** the layered pair keeps the (L1,
/// L2) atomic unit under a single lock so a `Get` populating L1 from L2
/// or a `Set` writing through both happens without inversion.

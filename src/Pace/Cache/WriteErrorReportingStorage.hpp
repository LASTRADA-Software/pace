/// IStorage decorator that surfaces *value-write failures* — the class of
/// errors that mean the cache could not persist a write at all: a full disk or
/// I/O error, an exhausted memory budget, on-disk corruption, or read-only
/// storage.
///
/// It exists because those failures were otherwise invisible in production. A
/// failed `SET` propagates as a `StorageError` up to `TracingStorage`, but that
/// decorator (a) logs only at `Trace` and (b) is inserted only when the log
/// level is already `Trace` — so at the default level a disk-full write
/// vanishes: no `storage:` line, no metric, just a store that silently did not
/// happen. This decorator is **always** in the stack. On each value write -- and on
/// each removal, which a disk can fail to persist just as well -- it
/// forwards to the inner storage and, when the result is a persistence-class
/// failure, logs one `Warn` line (visible at the default level) and increments
/// a counter surfaced through `Snapshot().writeErrors` — which the Prometheus
/// exporter renders as `pace_write_errors_total`.
///
/// Benign conditional-write outcomes (`KeyExists`/`KeyNotFound`/`CasMismatch`)
/// and client-side rejections (`ValueTooLarge`) are **not** counted or logged:
/// they are normal control flow, already visible to the client via the protocol
/// reply, and would dilute the disk/persistence signal an operator watches.
///
/// Thread safety: the counter is atomic and the injected logger is thread-safe,
/// so the decorator is safe above a `ShardedStorage` reached from several
/// reactor threads. All calls forward to the inner storage; this class adds no
/// semantic behaviour of its own.

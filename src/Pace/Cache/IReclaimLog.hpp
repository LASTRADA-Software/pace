/// mutations no caller asked for, so nothing above the tier knows the key.
///
/// **This is a buffer and not a callback, and that is the whole design.** A
/// tier reclaims from inside its locked region — `InMemoryLruStorage::EvictToFit`
/// runs under the `ShardedStorage` shard lock — while an observer publishes into
/// other connections' output buffers and takes its own locks to do it.
/// `NotifyingStorage::Update` already documents why the second must not happen
/// inside the first. So the two sides run under different rules:
///
///   * `Record` is called from **inside** the tier's lock. It appends and
///     nothing else: it must not publish, must not block, and must not re-enter
///     storage.
///   * `Drain` is called by `NotifyingStorage` **outside** every storage lock,
///     once the inner call has returned, and that is where events are fired.
///
/// Recording is gated by `IsRecording()` so a daemon nobody is watching pays one
/// relaxed atomic load per reclaimed entry rather than a string copy — the same
/// fast-probe shape as `IStorageMutationObserver::HasObservers`.

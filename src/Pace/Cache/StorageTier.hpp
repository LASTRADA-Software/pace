/// Which kind of storage a set of statistics describes.
///
/// A cache in this project is frequently more than one store — the daemon's
/// `--storage` and the node's `--cache-dir` both build an in-memory LRU over an
/// on-disk B+tree — and a merged view of the pair loses precisely the numbers an
/// operator needs. `LayeredStorage::Snapshot()` reports L2's item count, bytes and
/// budget with the composite's hit/miss patched over them, so the in-memory half
/// is invisible: a node whose RAM tier is full and whose disk tier is nearly empty
/// reads identically to one whose RAM tier was never populated.
///
/// A taxonomy rather than a bool because the third case is foreseeable — a tier
/// held on a peer, a tier on a second filesystem — and each would otherwise be
/// another field somebody adds to every struct that carries these numbers.
///
/// **The enumerator values are an index, so they are appended and never
/// reordered.** `TieredStorageStats` is a table indexed by them, and every
/// consumer that carries a tier apart from its label -- a scrape, a record on a
/// wire, anything positional -- inherits that indexing. Renumbering would read
/// one tier's numbers under another's name with nothing anywhere reporting a
/// fault, which is the shape of failure this whole file exists to prevent.
/// **ORDINALS ARE A WIRE CONTRACT. Append only; never insert or reorder.** (#308)
///
/// The paragraph above says these values are an index; this says who else reads that
/// index. `CompileCacheWire.hpp` carries cache tiers POSITIONALLY, so the ordinals cross
/// the network to a peer built from a different commit -- AGENT.md already records that
/// its enumerator order is part of the protocol, and this is that fact at the
/// declaration, where somebody adding a tier is actually looking.
///
/// The explicit `= N` is the enforcement: a mid-enum insertion is otherwise one added
/// line with nothing else visible, and the consequence -- one tier's numbers read under
/// another's name, on a peer -- shows up in no test here.
///
/// `Last` carries one too, because `readability-enum-initial-value` accepts all, none or
/// only-the-first and this tree does not silence clang-tidy. That is not merely the
/// lint's price: forgetting to bump it while adding a tier makes the new enumerator
/// COLLIDE with `Last`, which shortens `EnumeratorCount` and fails
/// `RowsInEnumeratorOrder`'s static_assert against `StorageTierTable`. The friction is
/// one line, and it is caught at compile time rather than on a peer.

/// Each shard is itself an IStorage and is owned by this object. A
/// `std::shared_mutex` per shard provides per-shard serialisation:
///
/// - Every call into a shard's storage takes an *exclusive* lock on the
///   relevant shard. The wrapped backends (InMemoryLruStorage,
///   CowTreeStorage) mutate state on `Get` and `Snapshot` too (LRU
///   ordering, stats counters, mutable `_stats` member), so a shared
///   lock would race concurrent same-shard operations.
/// - A call to shard N never blocks any operation on a different shard,
///   so distinct keys distributed across shards run in parallel on up to
///   `shards.size()` cores at once. The shared_mutex type is retained
///   in case a future split of Get into Lookup + deferred-promote
///   recovers read parallelism on a single shard.
///
/// Sharding is purely by key, which the cache engine maps to a single
/// shard for each operation. Operations that cross shards by definition
/// (`FlushWithGeneration`, `PurgeExpired`, `Snapshot`) iterate the
/// shards under each shard's appropriate lock.

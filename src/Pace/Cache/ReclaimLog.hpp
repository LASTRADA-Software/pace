///
/// Thread-safe by construction. `ShardedStorage` fans writes across shards and,
/// on Windows, drains its IOCP reactor from several threads, so two shards can
/// evict concurrently into one log.
///
/// **Bounded on purpose.** In the steady state the log holds almost nothing:
/// reclaims happen *inside* a storage call and `NotifyingStorage` drains as soon
/// as that call returns. One call can still reclaim without bound, though —
/// `Resize()` to a smaller budget evicts until it fits, and on a large cache that
/// is millions of keys in a single `EvictToFit`. Buffering all of them to publish
/// events nobody asked for would be a memory spike at exactly the moment the
/// operator was trying to *reduce* memory. Past the cap, entries are dropped and
/// counted: keyspace notifications are best-effort in redis too, and a bounded
/// loss the daemon can account for beats an unbounded buffer it cannot. Which end
/// goes is the same choice `core::async::AsyncQueueOverflow::DropNewest` names — the entries
/// already queued are the ones a subscriber is closest to receiving.

/// The cluster's configuration, as it travels through the replicated log.
///
/// ## Why a log entry and not a setting
///
/// A member set that could be edited on each node independently is not a
/// configuration, it is a way to build two clusters that both think they are
/// one. Putting it in the log makes every node adopt the same changes in the
/// same order, under the same rules that already order everything else.
///
/// ## One server at a time
///
/// A change is restricted to ONE member moving (§4.3): added, removed, promoted from
/// learner to voter, or demoted from voter to learner. That restriction is what makes
/// the change safe without joint consensus: any majority of the old configuration's
/// VOTERS and any majority of the new one's must share at least one voter, so the two
/// cannot elect different leaders in the same term. Change two at once — three voters
/// to five, say — and `{n1,n2}` is a majority of the old while `{n3,n4,n5}` is a
/// majority of the new, with nobody in common and nothing to stop both electing.
///
/// Joint consensus lifts that restriction and is deliberately not implemented:
/// it is a large, subtle mechanism, and a peer-to-peer compile fleet grows and
/// shrinks one machine at a time anyway.
///
/// ## Learners, and what one change at a time means for them (#1449)
///
/// A learner is replicated to and counted by nothing, so the argument above is about
/// the VOTERS and a learner change touches no voter majority at all:
///
/// - **Adding or removing a learner changes no quorum**, so the old and new voter sets
///   are the same set and every majority of one is a majority of the other. Always
///   safe -- and still one change at a time, because the rule that a second change
///   waits for the first to commit is about a configuration a truncation can still
///   roll back, which a learner entry is as much as any other.
/// - **A promotion is a voter addition** and a **demotion is a voter removal**, so
///   each is the single-voter delta the paragraph above already argues for.
///
/// **One at a time is load-bearing for READS as well as for commitment**, and that is
/// restated here for voters because it is the half nobody re-derives. CheckQuorum --
/// what everything reading from a leader rests on -- consults the COMMITTED
/// configuration while a change is in flight (`RaftNode::HasQuorumContact`). That is
/// only safe because any majority of the old voters and any majority of the new share
/// one voter, which would have had to move to a higher term to elect a competitor and
/// would have stopped confirming this leader. Promoting and removing in one proposal is
/// two voter changes, so it is `Unsafe` for exactly that reason and not merely by rule.
///
/// ## The rule that surprises people
///
/// A node uses the **latest configuration in its log, committed or not**. That
/// looks unsafe and is the opposite: a configuration that only took effect once
/// committed could not be used to *reach* the commitment, because committing it
/// requires a quorum of the very set it describes. The consequence to keep in
/// mind is that an uncommitted change can be rolled back by a log truncation,
/// so the active configuration has to be re-derived from the log whenever the
/// log changes — it is not a value that only ever moves forward.
///
/// ## Where the layout is versioned
///
/// Not here. This payload travels inside two containers that each carry a version of
/// their own -- a `FileRaftStorage` record and a `RaftWire` frame -- and it changes
/// only when BOTH move: `FileRaftStorage`'s `FormatVersion` so a store written in the
/// old layout reads as `UnsupportedFormatVersion` rather than as a configuration this
/// build misreads, and `RaftWire::CurrentVersion` so a peer that spells it the old way
/// is refused at the handshake. A third version inside the payload would be a third
/// thing that has to move with those two. `RaftMembership_test` pins the bytes, so a
/// layout change is a red test naming both.

/// Encode a list of ids as one field list.

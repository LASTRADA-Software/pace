/// The `0xFA` Raft peer wire format: how one node's `RaftMessage` reaches another.
///
/// **Header-only and pure.** Every function here is a transform between bytes and
/// the structs in `RaftTypes.hpp` — no socket, no clock, no state — which is the
/// same deliberate exception to the inject-every-dependency rule that
/// `CompileCacheWire` documents, and for the same reason: there is nothing to
/// inject. Keeping serialization out of `IRaftTransport` is what lets a whole
/// cluster run in one process over direct calls, which is how the algorithm is
/// tested against partitions and reordering at all.
///
/// ## Frame layout
///
/// ```
/// frame   := [u8 magic=0xFA][u8 version][u8 type][u32 payloadLength] payload
/// payload := field*        where field := [u32 len][len bytes]
///
/// connection := Challenge(acceptor -> dialler)
///               Proof(dialler -> acceptor)
///               Verdict(acceptor -> dialler)
///               (frame [32-byte tag])*   dialler -> acceptor, once Accepted, and
///                                        acceptor -> dialler too when the proof asked
///                                        for `SessionDirection::TwoWay`
/// ```
///
/// The first three are the HANDSHAKE and carry no trailer: their own fields hold the
/// signatures. Everything after is a SESSION frame, and its tag sits after the payload,
/// outside `payloadLength` -- so the header keeps exactly the meaning `WireFrame`
/// gives it, and the compile-cache wire that shares it is untouched. Which types are
/// legal in which part is `FramePhase`, a column of `MessageTable`. What the signatures
/// cover, and what key the tags are made under, is `RaftPeerSession`'s (#1308, #178).
///
/// The field grammar is `Core/WireFields.hpp`, shared verbatim with the
/// compile-cache wire so the two cannot drift. All multi-byte integers are
/// big-endian — a host-order length is a frame that only round-trips between
/// machines of the same architecture.
///
/// ## Why a declared length, when nothing here ever replies
///
/// The compile-cache wire needs its length so a rejection can be a *reply*
/// instead of a dropped connection. Raft has no replies to make: `IRaftTransport`
/// is best-effort and returns nothing, because the algorithm already assumes any
/// message may be lost and recovers on the next heartbeat.
///
/// The length earns itself for a different reason, and it is the one that matters
/// in a fleet nobody upgrades atomically. A peer connection is long-lived and
/// carries a stream of messages, so a frame a receiver cannot interpret is not
/// the end of the conversation — it must be **stepped over** so the next frame,
/// which the receiver very likely does understand, still arrives. Without a
/// declared length the only available response to an unrecognised type is to
/// close, and a node running a newer build would silently partition itself from
/// every older peer it talked to. That is why `FrameHeader::kindRaw` is kept
/// **raw**: an unknown type is a recoverable condition the reader skips, not a
/// decode failure, and validating it into an enum too early is what would throw
/// that away.
///
/// ## Why there is a handshake now
///
/// This section used to argue the opposite, and its reasoning was sound for what it
/// was asked: a VERSION negotiation re-run on every reconnect costs a round trip at
/// the moment a cluster is least healthy, while one byte per frame answers "can I
/// read this?" from the frame alone. That still holds, and the version byte still
/// travels in every frame.
///
/// What changed is that the wire authenticates (#1308), and freshness is the one
/// thing a frame cannot prove about itself. A tag over a frame alone accepts that
/// frame again tomorrow, on another connection, from anybody who recorded it. So each
/// connection opens with a challenge the ACCEPTOR chose, and every frame after it is
/// bound to that exchange. A reconnect costs one round trip, two signatures, two
/// verifications and a Diffie-Hellman exchange at each end (#178), which is the price the
/// old section was right to refuse for a version check and is cheap for the question it now
/// answers.
///
/// It also makes the version a property of the CONNECTION. A handshake frame at a
/// version this build does not speak ends the connection before anything is read, and
/// a session frame whose version byte differs from the handshake's ends it too --
/// stepping over it would mean guessing whether a trailer follows.

/// First byte of every Raft frame. Distinct from the compile-cache magic (0xFC),
/// the memcached binary magic (0x80) and every RESP first byte, so a frame that
/// arrives on the wrong port is rejected rather than half-parsed.
inline constexpr std::byte Magic { 0xFA };

/// Protocol version, carried in every frame header.
///
/// Deliberately not derived from the release version — the wire changes far more
/// rarely than the product, and tying them would force a flag day on every
/// release. The type itself is `WireFrame`'s, since the header it appears in is.

/// 2 since #1308, which changed the GRAMMAR -- a handshake before the first message
/// and a tag after every frame -- rather than only a MAC input, which is why this
/// moved where `DiscoveryWire::CurrentVersion` deliberately did not for #402.
///
/// 3 since #1449, and it is the grammar again, one level down. A configuration
/// carries voters AND learners, as two nested id lists where version 2 had one flat
/// list, and it travels in two places: `InstallSnapshotRequest::configuration`, and
/// the payload of every `EntryKind::Configuration` entry an AppendEntries carries. The
/// frame's arity did not move, so the frame itself would still decode -- which is
/// exactly why the version must: a version 2 peer's flat list read by this build's
/// decoder is refused as malformed at best, and a version 3 configuration entry
/// replicated to a version 2 follower is one it cannot read and silently ignores,
/// counting a quorum of the configuration before it. The question the #402/#1308 pair
/// asks is always WHICH changed, and here a field's grammar did.
///
/// 4 since #178, and it is the grammar a third time: every handshake frame changed shape. A
/// connection is proved by each end's OWN key rather than by a key every member shares, so a
/// proof and a verdict carry a 64-byte Ed25519 signature where they carried a 32-byte MAC, and a
/// challenge and a proof each carry an X25519 ephemeral key, from which the two ends agree a
/// session key nobody else holds. A version 3 peer's handshake is refused by its arity before
/// any field is read -- and should it ever decode, it proves nothing this build can check.
///
/// 5 since the office-fleet flag day, and it is the grammar a fourth time: the proof carries a
/// sixth field, the `SessionDirection` it asks for, and the session keys are derived per direction
/// under their own label (`fastcache-raft-session-v3`). A version 4 peer's five-field proof is
/// refused by its VERSION before any field is read, so the mismatch is reported as the unsupported

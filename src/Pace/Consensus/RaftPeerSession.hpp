/// `sig_d`: the dialler's Ed25519 signature over `[nonceA, ephA, d, a, dir, nonceD, ephD]`.
/// `sig_a`: the acceptor's, over all of that, `sig_d`, the verdict and its own id.
/// The frame keys: two, one per direction, each HKDF-SHA256 over X25519(ephA, ephD), salted
///               with both nonces, bound to the direction it seals, `dir`, both ephemeral keys
///               and both ids. Each frame's tag is an HMAC under its direction's key, over its
///               implicit position and its bytes (`Core/SessionSeal.hpp`).
///
/// ## Why each part is what it is
///
/// - **Each signature covers the WHOLE transcript so far.** Every field a peer sent is one it
///   can be held to: a signature that left one out would let whatever sits on the path change
///   that field and keep the signature -- an ephemeral key swapped for its own is a session key
///   it shares. `RaftPeerSession_test` changes each field in turn and requires each change to
///   be refused.
/// - **Signed by each end's OWN key.** A pre-shared key proved only "holds the cluster key", so
///   any holder could claim any id and removing one machine meant rotating the key on all the
///   others. A key per machine proves WHICH machine, and revoking one is one roster entry.
/// - **The acceptor challenges FIRST, before it has read a byte.** Its port is the surface
///   anything on the network can reach, so it signs nothing until the other end has proved an
///   id. A dialler signs only for an address it chose to dial.
/// - **Fresh values from BOTH ends in every signature.** The acceptor's nonce makes a proof
///   unreplayable; the dialler's makes the verdict fresh as well, so a recorded Accepted cannot
///   answer a dialler talking to something else.
/// - **Ids in the transcript, and NOT the endpoint.** What this produces is "the frames on this
///   connection come from d, for a", and the endpoint is routing neither side can state
///   identically: an acceptor binds the wildcard, a dialler reaches it through `--raft-self` or
///   NAT.
/// - **A verdict is SIGNED, including the refusals it can make.** A dialler told "you dialled
///   the wrong member" by a bare close could not tell that from an unknown key, and would report
///   a stale address book or a copied state directory as a key problem -- a confident wrong
///   signal. There is no oracle in it: a verdict exists only once the proof's signature has
///   verified, so only the member that signed learns anything.
/// - **The frame key is agreed, never sent.** Only the two ends hold their ephemeral secrets,
///   so a machine that recorded every handshake it ever saw still cannot open or forge a frame
///   of a session it was not an end of.
/// - **The position is implicit.** Both ends count, so a frame dropped, replayed or reordered
///   inside a connection fails its tag, and there is no field an attacker could set.
/// - **The direction is SIGNED, by both ends.** Whether the acceptor writes on the connection
///   is decided by the proof, so a relay that could flip that byte could make an acceptor
///   write to a peer that never asked, or starve one that did. Inside both transcripts, a
///   flipped byte is a forged proof.
/// - **One key per direction.** Both ends count their positions from zero, so under ONE key the
///   acceptor's first frame and the dialler's first frame are sealed at the same position under
///   the same key -- and a frame reflected back at its own sender opens. Each direction's key is
///   its own HKDF output, labelled with the direction, so a reflected frame fails its tag.

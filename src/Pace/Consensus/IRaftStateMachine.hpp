/// needs no idempotence within a single run.

/// **Across a restart it does need idempotence**, and that is the one thing worth
/// stating plainly: a recovered node re-applies from the beginning of whatever
/// its log holds, because the commit index is not durable and is re-learned from
/// the first leader that reaches it. Making the commit index durable would trade
/// that for an extra flush on the hot path, and re-applying a deterministic state
/// machine from a log is cheap by comparison — but a state machine with side
/// effects outside itself has to know.
///
/// **And a recovered node that holds a snapshot starts from the snapshot**: its
/// state is handed to `RestoreSnapshot` when the driver is built, before any entry
/// above it is applied, and only the entries above it are re-applied. The log below
/// the snapshot is gone, so this restore is the only way the state it produced comes
/// back (#1542).
///
/// **Or it does not start at all.** A node whose own snapshot, or any command its
/// own log still holds, is something this machine cannot read refuses to start --
/// `CanRead` and `RestoreSnapshot` answer for it, and `RaftDriver::Create` asks both
/// before anything is applied. The alternative is a node running on part of its own
/// state: a snapshot left unread takes the members, the settings and the revoked keys
/// with it, and a removal that fails OPEN reports nothing.

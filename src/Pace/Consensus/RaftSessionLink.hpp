/// A socket has one read operation and one write operation, and core-cpp ends the process for a
/// second of either (`contract::claimReadSlot`, `claimWriteSlot`). So the roles are fixed: the
/// server's loop only READS this socket once the handshake is over, and only the transport's
/// sender for this link WRITES on it -- after the server has finished writing its verdict, which
/// is before the link exists at all. The `FrameSealer` is that sender's alone for the same reason:
/// its position is the count of frames written, and one writer is what keeps it true.
///
/// ## Destroyed on the reactor
///
/// Every owner of a link lets go of it on the one reactor the server and the transport are built
/// on: the server's connection coroutine, and on the transport's side its map entry, the link's
/// sender and a stop's snapshot of the links. So the socket is destroyed on that reactor's thread
/// whichever of them lets go last. `RaftPeerTransport::Send`, which runs on any thread, must
/// never hold one -- it holds only the link's outbox, for exactly this reason.

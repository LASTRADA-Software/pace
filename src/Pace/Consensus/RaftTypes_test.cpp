// under the `WireEnumBound<E>::Highest` trait neither of these compiles at all
// without a specialization naming its last enumerator, and appending `C` to the
// second would need a second edit that nothing reminds you to make.

// that appends to a real wire enum to observe the bound move would be changing the
// wire, and one that does not append cannot observe anything -- the old and new
// bounds agree exactly for every enum in the tree today, which is why this is not
// a correctness bug and why no runtime assertion on a production enum can separate

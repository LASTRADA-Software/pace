/// every rule below be an ordinary unit test instead of a fixture.

/// ## What this class is actually for
///
/// Not storage. The container is a `std::vector`; anybody could write that. What
/// lives here is Raft's **Log Matching** property (§5.3):
///
/// > If two logs contain an entry with the same index and term, then the logs are
/// > identical in all entries up through that index.
///
/// That property is not maintained by the vector. It is maintained by `TryAppend`
/// being the only way a follower's log can change, and by that function refusing
/// an append whose `prevLogIndex`/`prevLogTerm` do not already match. Every other
/// mutating entry point would be a hole in it, which is why there are none —
/// see *Why nothing here can truncate on demand* below.
///

/// Raft's **Leader Append-Only** property says a leader never overwrites or
/// deletes entries in its own log. A public `Truncate()` would make violating that
/// a one-line mistake, and the violation is invisible: the leader keeps serving,
/// and what goes missing is somebody else's committed entry. Truncation is
/// therefore private and reachable only from `TryAppend`, which performs it only
/// on a genuine term conflict. The public surface makes the property structural
/// rather than something a reviewer has to keep watch over.

/// A sink bound to its target AFTER construction: the transport exists before the driver it
/// delivers into.
///
/// `RaftDriver::Create` takes the transport, so the transport is built first -- and a learner's
/// transport takes a sink, because it reads what an acceptor writes back. This breaks that cycle
/// without a null reference: the transport is handed this, and this is bound to the driver's sink
/// once the driver exists.
///
/// ## A message before the bind is DROPPED, never dereferenced
///
/// The caller binds before it starts the transport and asserts that it did (`Bound()`), so
/// nothing arrives unbound in a correctly wired process. Should something -- a reordering nobody
/// meant -- the message is dropped rather than delivered through a null pointer: a crash on the
/// reactor's thread would take every peer with it.
///
/// A drop there is recoverable only while it is TRANSIENT. Raft retransmits whatever it lost, so
/// a message or two before a late bind costs nothing; a sink left unbound drops EVERY message, and
/// a learner behind it never catches up -- which nothing here reports, so the precondition is the
/// guard, not the drop.
///
/// ## `DroppedUnbound()` is an in-process observation, not a series
///
/// No metrics surface renders it, and no `MetricsCatalog` row should: the only thing that can
/// move it is a wiring defect in the same process, so in every correct binary it would read zero
/// forever -- the plausible zero a row no writer in the process could move must not be rendered
/// as. It exists for a test to ask, and for a debugger.

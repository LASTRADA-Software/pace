/// **Every row has a writer.** The fleet's shared cache catalogued fifteen counters ahead of the
/// tasks that write them, each named meanwhile by `DeclaredAheadOfItsWriterTable` in
/// `CounterAttribution_test.cpp`; that table is empty now, and its own check refuses a row the
/// moment its counter gets a real writer -- so an exclusion cannot outlive the reason for it.
///
/// **The figures are pinned rather than pointed at**, which the rulebook asks for a
/// measurement's conditions: they describe this tree at one instant and must not silently
/// re-attribute themselves to a later one. `ctest -R counter-attribution` re-derives every one
/// of them from the source and fails when they drift -- so a stale figure here is a red build
/// rather than a sentence nobody re-reads, which is what the previous "106 of 144" became.

/// The binary form of a `StatsReading`: what a live-stats snapshot carries over `0xFC`
/// ([#1399](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1399)).
///
/// ## Positional, and protected by a layout digest
///
/// Every field travels by POSITION -- the catalogue's row order, then each struct's fields in
/// the order the tables below list them -- with no name and no tag, because a node pushes
/// this every tick and a name per series is what made `/metrics` 50 KB. What makes position
/// safe is `StatsReadingLayout`: a digest computed at COMPILE TIME from the very tables the
/// encoder walks (every catalogue row's series name and type, every struct field's name and
/// width, the tier and role names). It is the first eight bytes of every encoding, and
/// `DecodeStatsReading` refuses a reading whose digest is not this build's by name
/// (`StatsReadingFault::ForeignLayout`) before it reads a single field.
///
/// So two builds whose catalogues differ by one row -- inserted, removed or moved -- cannot
/// misread each other's figures shifted by one; they refuse. That is the property an
/// explicit `= N` on every enumerator would otherwise be asked to carry, and it is carried
/// here instead: `IMetricsSink::Counter`'s ordinals are transmitted, the enum says so at its
/// declaration, and the digest is the enforcement that makes a mid-enum insertion a refusal
/// rather than a silent shift (the transmitted-enum bullet in
/// `.agent/rules/wire-and-protocol.md`). `= N` on a hundred rows would make every insertion a
/// renumbering and still say nothing about a struct field.
///
/// **What the digest cannot see**, stated so nobody over-reads it: a row whose NAME and member
/// POINTER disagree inside one build (`{"bytesUsed", &StorageStats::itemCount}`) encodes and
/// decodes self-consistently in that build. Name and pointer sit on one line for that reason.
///
/// ## Absent stays absent
///
/// Every optional member travels as a presence bit, and a counter this build's sink cannot
/// carry is a clear bit rather than a zero (#1353). A decoded reading therefore renders
/// through `RenderPrometheus` to the same body the node itself would have served.
///
/// ## Grammar
///
/// Big-endian, as the rest of this wire:
/// ```
/// u64 layout digest
/// counter presence bitmap, ceil(rows/8) bytes; then u64 per present counter, in row order
/// u8 presence: bit0 storage, bit1 host, bit2 upstreamConfigured, bit3 consensus, bit4 hostLoad;
///             bit5 RETIRED (a certified roster's lapse), never reused
/// storage (if present): u64 per StorageStatsWireFields row
/// tier presence bitmap, ceil(tiers/8) bytes; then StorageStatsWireFields per present tier
/// host (if present): u64 per HostCapacityWireFields row
/// hostLoad (if present): u8 presence (bit0 cpu, bit1 availableMemoryBytes);
///                        u64 busy, u64 total (if cpu); u64 bytes (if availableMemoryBytes)
/// upstreamConfigured (if present): u8, 0 or 1
/// consensus (if present): u32 member count, then per member u32 length + bytes;
///                         u8 leader present, then u32 length + bytes; u64 term; u64 commitIndex; u8 role
/// u64 uptime seconds
/// u32 length + bytes: the version of the build that captured the reading

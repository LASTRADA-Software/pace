/// Command counts, hit/miss splits and evictions do **not**: those are
/// `StorageStats`, produced by the storage that actually performs them, and that
/// is what `stats`, `INFO` and `/metrics` all report. This enum used to carry a
/// second set of enumerators for the same concepts — `CmdGet`, `CmdSet`,
/// `CmdDelete`, `GetHits`, `GetMisses`, `Evictions`, `BytesIn`, `BytesOut` — and
/// not one of them was incremented anywhere in the tree, so each exported a
/// permanent zero under a name an operator would reasonably read as the real
/// count. They are removed rather than wired up: a second source of truth for a
/// number `StorageStats` already owns is the thing to avoid, not to complete.
///
/// Every remaining enumerator needs a row in `Metrics/MetricsCatalog.hpp`, which
/// `static_assert`s that it has one — that is what makes a new counter reach
/// `/metrics` by construction rather than by somebody remembering.

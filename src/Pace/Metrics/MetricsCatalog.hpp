/// ## Why this table exists
///
/// A counter used to be described in two unrelated places: the
/// `IMetricsSink::Counter` enumerator, and — only if somebody remembered — a row
/// in `PrometheusFormatter`'s render table giving its exported name, help text
/// and kind. Nothing tied the two together, and a counter present in one but not
/// the other is not a build error. It is a counter that increments and is never
/// exported.
///
/// That is not hypothetical, and it was not a corner case. **Seven of the eleven
/// live counters were missing from that table**: both TLS splits, and all five
/// `dispatch_*` — which `docs/getting-started/distributed-compilation.md`
/// documents as the things to read off `/metrics` when distribution misbehaves,
/// with a table naming each one. An operator working the commonest setup failure
/// ("no worker matches this toolchain") followed that guide to an endpoint that
/// had never carried a single one of those series.
///
/// So the row is the definition. The renderer walks this table, and
/// `CoversEveryCounter()` is `static_assert`ed below — a counter added to the enum
/// without a row here fails to compile, which is the only version of this that
/// cannot drift again.

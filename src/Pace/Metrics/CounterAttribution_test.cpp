/// @file CounterAttribution_test.cpp
/// `CounterSoleWriterTable` against the tree it describes.
///
/// ## What this is for
///
/// The attribution decides whether a figure is REPORTED, never whether it is correct, and the
/// two directions of error are not symmetric. A row attributed too WIDELY renders a plausible
/// zero -- the cost this tree paid for every row before #1484, and one somebody has already
/// been surprised by. A row attributed too NARROWLY renders `-`, which reads as *this process
/// does not do that*, and nobody re-checks it. **Only the second is silent**, so it is the one
/// a check has to be built around, and #1501's acceptance says so in as many words.
///
/// ## Why this is not a scan for `Increment(Counter::X)`
///
/// Such a scan finds 39 of 148 rows. The other 109 are written through a table -- a
/// `SurfaceRefusal` row spent by `Refuse(row)`, a `LeaseToken` outcome row, or a classifier
/// returning the row for its caller to spend -- so the counter's name appears at no call site
/// at all. A writable set derived that way would have rendered all 109 absent, which is the
/// same defect as the bug it was meant to fix, nearly four times over.
///
/// ## How the check avoids having to tell a write from a read
///
/// Distinguishing the two needs all four write spellings plus the read ones, and the list grew
/// from two to five while this was being written. Two properties do the same work without it:
///
/// 1. **Every production file naming `Counter::` is classified** -- it is in `WriterFiles` with
///    its surface, or in `ReadsOnlyFiles` with a reason. A new writer in an unlisted file then
///    fails the build, which is the direction that would otherwise be silent.
/// 2. **A classified writer file may only name counters attributed to its surface.** That is
///    exactly "attributed too narrowly", and it needs no notion of what a write looks like.
///
/// A file that only READS a counter is on the second list, so property 2 never asks about it.
///
/// ## Counters declared ahead of their writer
///
/// A catalogue row landing before the task that writes it is legitimate -- a fleet feature
/// crosses several tasks, and the wire layout, the surface attribution and the catalogue row want
/// to move together in the change that pins the format, before dispatch or the host exist to
/// write them. `DeclaredAheadOfItsWriterTable` names each such counter and what will write it, and
/// the mechanism-figures case below excludes them from its pinned totals BY NAME rather than
/// discovering an absence and shrugging. The staleness case beside it is the other half: a row
/// left in the table after its counter gets a real writer is refused, so the table cannot become a
/// second, silent way to mark a row "attributed but nobody has to prove it".

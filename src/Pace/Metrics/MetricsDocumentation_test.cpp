/// The daemon's documented per-series table against the exposition it renders.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// `pace-kv` exported two compile-cache refusal counters that appeared in **no
/// documentation at all**, while `pace-node` documented its twin of one
/// of them ([#648](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/648)). An
/// operator watching a rolling upgrade follows the node series because it is the one
/// the documentation names, sees it settle, and reads a mixed fleet as a converged
/// one — which is the exact judgement those counters exist to support.
///
/// `.agent/rules/metrics-and-observability.md` already records the failure of an
/// operator being told to scrape a series that was never exported. This is the same
/// fact from the other end: a series exported that nobody was ever told to scrape.
/// Nothing connected the two — `MetricsCatalog` decides what is rendered, and the
/// prose is prose — so this is the connection, and it fails in **both** directions:
///
///   - a series the daemon renders and the page does not name, which is #648;
///   - a series the page names and the daemon does not render, which is what a
///     rename leaves behind and is the worse direction, because an operator then
///     alerts on a series that will read "no data" forever.
///
/// ## Why it renders rather than reading `CounterTable`
///
/// Reading the catalog would cover the counters and miss everything else: the
/// storage block, the per-tier series and `pace_uptime_seconds` are rendered
/// from `MetricsSnapshot` and appear in no table this test could walk. Rendering the
/// production formatter over a snapshot that has every optional part present asks
/// the question about the actual exposition instead.
///
/// ## What it does NOT cover, stated rather than left to be discovered
///
/// **The `pace_*` series** (no `d`). Every process that serves this endpoint
/// exports every counter, so a daemon's scrape also carries the worker, node and
/// scheduler series — flat at zero, because nothing in that binary moves them. They
/// are `pace-node`'s and are documented on its page; documenting sixty
/// permanently-zero rows on the daemon's page would bury the rows that mean
/// something. The deployment page says so in prose, and that prose is outside what
/// this check can verify.
///
/// **Whether a description is right.** This compares names. A row whose sentence is
/// wrong passes.

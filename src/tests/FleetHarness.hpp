/// A compile fleet running deterministically in one process.
///
/// Test infrastructure, header-only and never linked into the library — the same
/// shape as `Consensus/RaftClusterHarness.hpp`, which is the model, and the same
/// argument for existing.
///
/// ## Why this exists rather than more unit tests
///
/// `SchedulerService`, `WorkerRegistry` and `LeaseTable` each have cases pinning
/// their rules in isolation, and that is not the same as the fleet being right.
/// Several rules in `.agent/rules/distributed-compilation.md` are about a
/// **sequence** across two machines — a lease granted by one scheduler and
/// resolved against that same one after leadership has moved — and no
/// single-transition test reaches an interleaving. The only other way to arrange
/// one today is a script that spawns processes, binds ports and waits on a
/// wall clock, which cannot schedule the interleaving at all: it can only hope
/// for it.
///
/// ## Why it lives in `src/tests/`
///
/// By shape it belongs beside `RaftClusterHarness`. It does not go there.
/// `RaftClusterHarness` sits in `Consensus/` because everything it touches sits
/// in `Consensus/`; a fleet spans `Distributed/`, the node and the launcher's
/// client sources, so putting it under `src/Pace/` would make a library
/// directory include an app header. This tree already enforces that `Net/` must
/// not depend on `Core/` with a ctest; library-depending-on-app is the worse
/// version of the same thing and has no gate to catch it.
///
/// ## What is real here and what is not
///
/// Real: `SchedulerService` and `SchedulerProtocol` decide and frame every reply;
/// the launcher's own `Cc::ExchangeFramed` writes and reads the client side;
/// `Cc::Dispatch` runs unmodified, so the lease-redirect and release-routing
/// logic under test is the shipped logic.
///
/// Not real: there is no socket and no worker process. A request is handed to the
/// addressed scheduler's protocol object, and its answer is replayed to the
/// client through a `ScriptedSocket`. The worker's endpoint answers whatever
/// `SetWorkerReply` (or, per address, `AddWorkerAddress`) was given, or reaches nothing
/// once `SetWorkerUnreachable` has taken it off the network.
///
/// Time moves only in `Step`.
///
/// ## Machine tickets
///
/// A request presenting a `MachineTicket` credential to a scheduler is decided as production's
/// session surface decides it: that node's production `Distributed::TicketVerifier`, over a
/// `StateLeaseRoster` adopting the node's own cluster state, a per-node spent set and an audience
/// that is exactly the endpoint dialled. The AUTH reply is scripted ahead of the command's, and the
/// command's caller is `Distributed::CallerContextOf` over the node's oracle with the ticket's
/// machine folded in -- so a case sets a production `NodeMembership` (`PublishMembershipAt`) and a
/// non-loopback caller host (`SetCallerHost`) before it asserts anything about admission.
///
/// A WORKER address answers a presented ticket without looking at it, unless
/// `VerifyTicketsAtWorker` named it: then the same production verifier decides, over an audience
/// the case supplies -- production's `NodeAudience` when the question is which endpoints a ticket
/// may name, as it is for a dial hint.
///
/// ## Rosters (#178)
///
/// Every scheduler signs its grants with its own identity key -- `TestKeyPair` of its
/// endpoint, which is also its member id -- and holds a cluster state of its own, set by
/// `SetClusterStateAt`: an ex-leader that has not heard a change is a node holding an older
/// one. A node's presence round dials a scheduler through this harness (`Dial`, `SetUnreachable`), so
/// `SchedulerLink`'s redirects and fallbacks run as production runs them. A `LearnerWorker` is a
/// machine admitted as a LEARNER: a production `Pace::Node::NodeRoster` fed the state of the
/// scheduler it learns from -- re-applied at every `Step` and at `Apply`, as a learner applies what its
/// leader replicates -- with the production lease validator and ticket verifier over it.

/// **This exists because a per-process counter is not unique.**
/// `catch_discover_tests` registers every TEST_CASE as its own ctest test, so
/// cases run as separate PROCESSES -- and under `ctest -j` several run at once.
/// A `static int counter` starts at zero in every one of them, so the first
/// scratch directory in each process is `<prefix>-1`. Two of them then share a
/// path, and whichever constructs second wipes the files the first is still
/// using: a fixture that fails only under parallelism, only sometimes.
///
/// That was found and fixed once already, in Stats_test.cpp, whose comment
/// records it as "a real, reproduced flake ... not a hypothetical". The fix
/// lived as a private helper in that one file, so three later test files
/// reintroduced the same bug -- which is why it became a shared header rather
/// than a fourth copy.
///
/// It then happened a FIFTH time, in `RaftStorage_test.cpp`, and that occurrence
/// is why this header lives here rather than beside the launcher's tests. The
/// shared version sat under `src/apps/fastcache-cc/`, which the library test
/// binary does not have on its include path -- so the one test suite that could
/// not reach it re-derived it, counter and all, and ten of its cases failed
/// under `ctest -j 8`. A helper is only shared if it is somewhere everything
/// that needs it can include from; `src` is on all three test targets' include
/// paths, which is the same reason `tests/Unwrap.hpp` lives beside this file.
///
/// **And unique among LIVE processes is not unique across TIME: the path is handed out EMPTY.**
/// A pid is reused -- on Windows within minutes -- so a directory an earlier process left behind
/// under the same pid and counter is the path a later process is handed. A fixture that died
/// before its teardown, or never had one, left a Raft log, a snapshot and a key there, and the
/// next process to draw that pid opened them as its own: `ConsensusTier_test` failed SaveLog in
/// every section of one case, and refused a tier start in another, at 9 runs in 200 (both cases
/// per run, through ctest, against the 1400 such directories one machine had accumulated). So
/// whatever sits at the path is removed before it is returned. That is safe for the reason
/// `ScratchDirectory` always cleared: the name carries THIS process's pid, so what it can reach is
/// this process's own -- never a live peer's, whose pid differs -- or a dead one's.
/// @param prefix Short, human-recognisable tag so a leaked directory can be
///        traced back to the test that made it.
/// @param parent Directory the name is placed under. Defaults to the system
///        temp directory; a caller that reparents the name elsewhere passes
///        its own, so the clear below reaches the path it actually uses
///        rather than the default one it discarded.
/// @return A path under `parent`, absolute exactly when `parent` is, guaranteed
///         not to exist at return time. Nothing is created there.

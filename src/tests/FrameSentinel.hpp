/// a test fake is a shared helper too, because three private copies of one scripted
/// `core::net::ISocket` carried the same defect in two of them. Four private copies of a
/// destruction counter across four test files is the same shape with one more copy.
///
/// **Why a sentinel at all, when LeakSanitizer already reports a leaked frame.** A leak
/// only a sanitizer notices is a red once in N runs on one platform, and reads as a
/// flake; counting destructions fails for the case's own reason everywhere, including
/// the Windows and macOS legs where no leak checker runs at all. The sanitizer stays as
/// the independent second opinion, never as the assertion.
///
/// **Passed BY VALUE into every coroutine**, which is both this project's coroutine rule
/// and what puts the sentinel in the FRAME: a body local would not exist in a lazy
/// `core::async::Task` that has never started, and the ownership cases are precisely about such a
/// task. Move-aware, so the caller's temporary dying at the end of the call expression
/// is not counted as the frame dying.
///
/// **It only means something beside a case that must NOT count.** A counter that never
/// observes a frame it expected to survive cannot distinguish *the fix works* from
/// *everything is freed*, and freeing what something else owns is a double free rather
/// than a leak repaired. Every use of this pairs a detached case with an owned one.

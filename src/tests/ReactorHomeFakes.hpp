/// `core::async::syncRun` over a blocking connector -- since a home is a required reference and
/// null is not a spelling.

/// A home over a `TestLoop` nobody turns: a timer armed on it never fires, and what is retired to it
/// is held until the home goes -- declared after the loop, so freed before it, which is the "with
/// that reactor stopped" arm of `TeardownIsSerialisedWithDispatch` by construction.
///
/// Right for a case whose sockets are blocking ones, where nothing is timed on a reactor and a kept
/// session ages out by the pool's own clock alone. A case that means the idle timer to FIRE runs on
/// a real loop (`NodeIoLoop`) instead.

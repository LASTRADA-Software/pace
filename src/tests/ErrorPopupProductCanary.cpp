// Built with the PRODUCT policy (`PACE_ERROR_POPUPS_POLICY on-request`), so the
// startup object installs the suppression only when the environment carries the variable.
// `scripts/error-popup-product-gate.cmake` runs it twice -- with the variable and without --
// and requires the two answers to differ in the right direction: routed to a file when

// binary by hand keeps.

// It REPORTS the mode rather than asserting. The other canary proves an assert ends the
// process; this one has to show the NOT-suppressed direction too, and an assert there would
// open the dialog it is describing -- on a desktop that waits for a click, and on a runner
// with no desktop it proves nothing either way. `_CRTDBG_REPORT_MODE` asks the question
// without firing anything.

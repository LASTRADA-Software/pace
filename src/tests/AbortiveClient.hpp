/// A loopback client that leaves by RESET rather than by FIN.
///
/// **`core::net::ISocket` cannot express an abortive close, and should not.** The two
/// departures are different bytes on the wire -- FIN says *I have finished
/// sending*, RST says *this connection is gone* -- and a server tells them apart
/// through different arms: `WaitReadable` answers `0` for the first and an ERROR
/// for the second, on all three reactors. `Net/WaitReadable_test.cpp` is the
/// measurement of that, one abortive close per platform.
///
/// A fake that can be told to return an error proves nothing about either, because
/// the whole question is which of the two the KERNEL sends. So the close has to be
/// real, which means a raw handle: there is no `core::net::ISocket` verb for it, and adding one
/// would have exactly the consumers `ShutdownWrite` was added to avoid.
/// `ShutdownWrite` earned its place by making a rule about half-closing statable in
/// PRODUCTION; nothing in production wants to reset its own peer, since the shape of
/// a close belongs to the client.
///
/// **Shared because a second consumer arrived, and because drift here is SILENT.**
/// Two files need an abortive close as of this change --
/// `Net/WaitReadable_test.cpp`, which measures what the primitive reports, and
/// `apps/pace-node/FrameEndpoint_test.cpp`, which needs the surface to
/// notice a reset peer. The hazard is not maintenance, and it is a property of the
/// code rather than a story about its history: **a consumer's case stays GREEN when
/// this stops working.** A `SO_LINGER` that stops taking degrades the close to an
/// ordinary FIN; the EOF arm answers instead of the error arm; the departure is
/// still counted; the assertion still passes. `FrameEndpoint_test.cpp` cannot
/// distinguish those by construction -- both of `WatchPeer`'s arms reach the same
/// `RecordDeparture`, which is #817, closed as refuted. One implementation is what
/// makes `WaitReadable_test.cpp`'s assertion -- that this really does report an
/// ERROR rather than a `0` -- the guard for every other user.
///
/// It builds on core-cpp's handle type (`core::platform::NativeHandle`) and on
/// `Pace::CloseNativeSocket`, and two of its steps are not optional.
///
/// **`core::platform::ensureWinsockInitialized` because Winsock** returns
/// `INVALID_SOCKET` with `WSANOTINITIALISED` for a `::socket` call that precedes it,
/// so a client that omits it works only for as long as something else happens to
/// have bound a listener first.
///
/// **`SO_NOSIGPIPE` because macOS**, where `MSG_NOSIGNAL` does not exist and the
/// suppression lives ENTIRELY in the socket option; Linux has the send flag instead.
/// Sending to a peer that has already gone would raise SIGPIPE and abort the whole
/// Catch2 process: a crash rather than a failed assertion, on the one platform where
/// this client's own subject makes a dead peer likely.

/// The one scripted `ISecureRandom` (#1527).
///
/// Shared rather than written per file, for `NodeProofFakes.hpp`'s reason: every case that
/// reaches for this asserts either that a nonce or an id CARRIES the scripted bytes, or that a
/// draw that FAILS is refused -- and a second copy that served its bytes in another order, or
/// failed in another way, would make both kinds of case pass for the wrong reason.

/// An `ISecureRandom` that serves scripted bytes, or refuses every draw.
///
/// **Two modes and one class**, because the two questions a case asks of this seam are *did the
/// bytes come from here* and *what happens when nothing can come from here*, and both are asked
/// of the same production call sites.
///
/// Scripted bytes are served in order across calls and CYCLE once exhausted, as
/// `ScriptedRandomSource` does. That makes the fake more permissive than the thing it stands for
/// in exactly one way, stated rather than hidden: a script shorter than what a case draws
/// REPEATS, where the real source never does. A case that needs two nonces to differ scripts at
/// least two nonces' worth -- `Ascending` is the spelling for that.

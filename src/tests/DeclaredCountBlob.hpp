/// A wire blob assembled field by field, so a case can declare a count the blob
/// cannot possibly supply and stop right there.
///
/// This exists because of ONE recurring defect class -- a declared element count
/// reserved from before the bytes behind it were counted (#241, #267, #269, #271) --
/// and the test for each instance has the same shape: build a header, write a
/// hostile count, leave some trailing bytes, and check the decoder refuses rather
/// than reserving. Three files had written that shape independently, down to an
/// identical `for (auto const shift: { 24, 16, 8, 0 })` loop, and the class is not
/// finished: #304 and the encoder ticket still have to write it again. A test idiom
/// that reappears with each instance of a recurring bug class is the one worth
/// lifting, because its whole job is to make the next instance cheap to guard (#306).
///
/// The encoder ticket was #305, and it landed a SECOND use for this: `Field` below
/// spells an encoder's expected output field by field, so what a codec emits is
/// asserted against something other than the decoder that reads it back.
///
/// **No format is baked in.** The copy this generalises put `StreamCodec::Magic` and
/// `TypeStream` in its constructor, which is exactly why neither of the other two
/// sites could adopt it -- a builder that knows one format is a builder for one file.
/// Every prefix is a STEP, so a caller spells its own header and this class stays
/// ignorant of what it is building.
///
/// The width conversions are `WireFields::ToBigEndian`, not a fourth shift loop. That
/// is not tidiness: a hand-rolled loop in a test is a second implementation of the
/// convention under test, so a blob built wrong the same way the decoder reads wrong
/// would still round-trip and the case would pass.

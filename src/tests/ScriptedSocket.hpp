/// An `core::net::ISocket` that replays a fixed reply stream and records what was written.
///
/// ## Why this is one file rather than three
///
/// It existed three times — `ScriptedTcpClient` in `CacheProtocol_test.cpp`,
/// `ScriptedScheduler` in `WorkerProtocol_test.cpp` and `ScriptedSocket` in
/// `AuthRefusalContract_test.cpp` — and **the same defect was live in two of
/// them**: `WriteVectored` answering `0`, which is a short write and which
/// `core::net::sendAll` correctly treats as a failure. Nothing had ever tripped on it,
/// because `CacheProtocol::Exchange` is the first caller to send a vectored write
/// and no case reached it. The second copy was found and fixed while writing
/// #340; the first was still carrying the identical defect a day later and was
/// found only by reading the three side by side (#362).
///
/// That is the argument. A fake nothing exercises does not report its own bugs,
/// so the copies drift silently and the drift is discovered by whichever test
/// happens to walk into it.
///
/// ## Why `src/tests/` rather than beside one of its callers
///
/// `AuthRefusalContract_test.cpp` carried a comment saying its copy was
/// deliberate, because the point of that file is that the launcher and the node
/// share *nothing* but the wire, and a fixture reaching across would be the
/// coupling the test denies. That argument is about the two **binaries**, and it
/// still holds: this header is neither binary's — it is test infrastructure both
/// borrow, exactly as they both borrow `Unwrap.hpp` — and it includes nothing
/// from either app.
///
/// ## What it is not
///
/// A script, not a server. It answers with bytes decided before the call, so it
/// cannot model a peer whose reply depends on what it was sent. Where a *live*
/// responder is wanted, `Net/InMemoryTransport` is the tool.

/// correct one on any host where a sleep costs what it asked for. Windows' ~15 ms
/// timer granularity is what made the two shipped copies enforce 15 s and 7.5 s
/// against a stated 5 s; a fake that can overrun on demand reproduces it on every
/// platform, and deterministically.
///
/// A shared fake, for `ScriptedSocket.hpp`'s reason: a copy per file drifts in
/// silence. The factor is REQUIRED, so no case gets an overrun it did not ask
/// for. `ServiceControl_test.cpp`'s fixed-cost wait is a different fake: its
/// sleeps cost a constant, not a multiple of the request.

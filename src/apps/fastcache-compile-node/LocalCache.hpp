/// ## Why a node caches at all
///
/// The shared `fastcached` already holds every object, so a second copy looks
/// redundant. It is not, and the reason is the one this whole architecture was
/// reshaped for: a **local rebuild on a slow or bad network should not go to the
/// wire at all**. A developer who rebuilds the same tree twenty times a day pays
/// the round trip twenty times for objects that never left their machine, and on a
/// link that is slow or lossy that cost is the difference between a cache that
/// helps and one that hurts.
///
/// ## The rules, and why each is not the obvious one
///
/// **A local hit does not consult the upstream at all.** That is the entire point;
/// an implementation that revalidated would have moved the round trip rather than
/// removed it. Object keys are content-addressed -- the key is a digest over the
/// preprocessed text, the arguments, the compiler identity and the dependency set --
/// so a key that matches names the same object by construction. There is nothing an
/// upstream could tell us about it that we do not already know.
///
/// **A local miss populates the local tier from the upstream.** Otherwise the second
/// build is as slow as the first, and a "cache" that never fills is a proxy.
///
/// **A store writes local FIRST, then offers upstream.** The local write is the one
/// that must not be lost: it is what makes this machine's next build fast, and it
/// cannot fail for a reason the network chose. Offering upstream afterwards is
/// best-effort by contract -- a fleet that cannot be reached costs the fleet a
/// shared entry and costs this machine nothing.
///
/// **An unreachable upstream is a miss, not an error.** Every caller's answer to
/// both is "compile it", so distinguishing them at this layer would buy nothing and
/// would give the build a failure mode it does not need. The distinction is kept
/// where it is actionable: a counter an operator can read.

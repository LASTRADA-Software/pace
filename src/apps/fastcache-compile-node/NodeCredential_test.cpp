// **Every site in one file, and that arrangement IS the test** (#404).
//
// `--requirepass` on this worker is presented and never required, and it was captured
// by value at three construction sites: the cache tier's upstream client, the cluster
// admin verbs, and the heartbeat round. A rotation that reached two of the three is a
// process running a configuration no file describes -- in the one area where the
// symptom is an authentication failure nobody can reproduce, on a machine nobody is
// watching.
//
// Since then the heartbeat round presents NOTHING, and the case for it here says so: the
// secret is the `--upstream` cache's, a scheduler checks no password, and presenting it
// there handed it to every scheduler this node dialled. So the sites are two that rotate
// and three rounds that must stay bare, and a suite spreading them across files is one in
// which the next site is the one nobody adds. Each case reads the bytes that went OUT,
// because a site holding a stale copy -- or presenting where it should not -- still
// returns a correct object, still logs nothing, and still moves no counter.
//
// What is deliberately NOT asserted anywhere here is `ICredentialSource::Current()`
// alone. A source that rotates while every site ignores it is precisely the bug, and a
// case asserting the source would pass under it.

/// Every grant is signed by the voter that issued it, with its own identity key, so a worker
/// asks "is this signer one of the cluster's voters, unrevoked" -- and the answer is the state
/// the node's own consensus applied (`Distributed::StateLeaseRoster`), which needs no certificate
/// and never expires. Every serving node runs consensus, a learner included, so that is the only
/// roster there is; a node no other machine can reach runs none and checks no grant -- the rule

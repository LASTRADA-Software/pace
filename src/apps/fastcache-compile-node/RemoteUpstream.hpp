/// interval rather than one per miss.
///
/// ## Safety was decided first, and it is what licenses remembering at all
///
/// `AGENT.md`'s *Caching an expensive repeated answer*: the question is what a STALE answer does,
/// not what the probe costs.
///
/// - **Stale UNREACHABLE** -- the cache came back inside the interval. A local miss it could have
///   answered is answered as a miss and compiled locally, and a store is not offered upstream.
///   That fails CLOSED (it is the answer an unreachable upstream already produced) and self-heals
///   at the next probe, at most one interval later.
/// - **Stale REACHABLE** -- the cache went away since the last exchange that was answered. Every
///   operation that passed `ShouldDial` before the first failure LANDS is already dialling, and
///   each of them pays its own ceiling -- the connect ceiling where the dial fails, the connect
///   and I/O ceilings where the peer accepts and stalls. On a reactor that is every miss in flight
///   at that moment, not one. Only operations arriving after the first failure lands are spared.
///   Each operation still pays at most what EVERY operation paid before this existed, so this
///   direction is no worse than no memo at all.
///
/// Neither direction produces a wrong answer that looks right: every outcome this changes was
/// already a miss or a declined store.
///
/// ## An exchange that never completed counts, exactly like a dial that failed
///
/// A connection that opened and then timed out or lost its peer -- `CacheOutcomeKind::Transport` --
/// is remembered as a failed dial is. It is the COSTLIER failure: it spends up to the per-operation
/// I/O ceiling, not a connect ceiling. Both staleness directions stay safe:
/// - a peer that recovered costs a MISS for at most one interval;
/// - a peer that stalls again costs one wasted exchange per interval rather than one per miss.
///
/// ## Refreshed on an INTERVAL, never on a miss
///
/// Only whether the EXCHANGE completed is evidence. A `Miss` or a `Rejected` from a cache that
/// answered says the cache is up, and no answer moves this toward unreachable -- so no request
/// pattern can make it probe more than once per interval, which is the amplifier
/// `RemoteUpstream::DialTarget`'s own comment rules out.
///
/// ## The probe is stamped BEFORE it runs
///
/// `ShouldDial` moves the next-probe instant the moment it grants a probe, not when the probe
/// fails. A dial suspends on the reactor for up to the connect ceiling, and every miss arriving
/// meanwhile would otherwise find the window expired and dial too -- a burst of exactly the dials
/// this exists to remove, at exactly the moment the cache is least likely to answer.
///
/// That keeps probes from overlapping only while a probe finishes inside one interval, which is
/// why `CacheTier.cpp` asserts the interval above the connect and I/O ceilings together. It is a
/// floor rather than a guarantee: `RemoteUpstream::DialTarget`'s address lookup is bounded by
/// neither ceiling, so a probe whose lookup hangs can still outlast an interval.
///
/// ## One thread
///
/// Read and written only on the node's I/O reactor, which is one thread (`NodeIoLoop`), as
/// `RemoteUpstream::_lastLookupAt` is -- so it takes no lock.

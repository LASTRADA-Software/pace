/// It also outlives both tiers by construction, which matters because a node may run

///
/// A machine that is not this one is admitted by what it can PROVE -- a live identity key,
/// through a session proof or a ticket its own key signed -- or by `--fleet-open`, never by
/// the address it dials from. A client machine, which is no cluster peer and never will be,
/// is admitted the same way as a member: the roster names its key.

/// Whether this configuration admits a machine that is not this one.

/// The routes `NodeMembership`'s constructor composes, asked of the configuration instead of
/// a caller, and it lives HERE for that reason: a reader adding a route has this function in
/// front of them. Left elsewhere it was a second reader of the same policy with nothing
/// pointing at it, and a new route would silently stop the startup rule firing: an open
/// compile port, every refusal counter at zero, and a fleet green from both ends.
///
/// **The route the rulebook promised has arrived, and it is a CREDENTIAL**: a roster admits
/// machines by proof and by ticket, whatever address they dial from. So the question needs to
/// know what the caller counts of that route, and the caller states it: `Absent` counts none,
/// `Unknown` counts it on every node running consensus -- the only node that holds a roster, its
/// applied state -- which is the fail-closed reading a guard wants, and `Formed` is consensus's own
/// roster, which admits exactly the members the formation half below names. Removing a route fails OPEN through exactly this
/// function, because a worker that reads it as false builds a lease check that verifies nothing.
///
/// It cannot be answered by asking the oracle, which is why it is a separate function rather
/// than a method. `Oracle()` answers "is this caller admitted" in the present tense; this asks
/// whether the admitted set will EVER contain another machine, and the key roster is empty at

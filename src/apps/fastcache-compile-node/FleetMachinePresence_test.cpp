// These are the ticket's own acceptance cases, and they need two machines to say anything, so

// a scheduler-only machine appears on a page that a DIFFERENT machine's worker also appears on,
// and that its history survives leadership moving to somewhere else.
//
// **Every case here is impossible to write against worker registration**, which is the point
// rather than an aside. A node with `--slots=0` registers nothing, so before `NodeAnnounce`
// existed there was no verb through which any of this could have been arranged -- the fixture
// itself is the evidence that the old shape could not express the fact.

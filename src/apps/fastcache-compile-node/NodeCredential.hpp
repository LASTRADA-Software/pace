/// What this worker PRESENTS to its peers, asked afresh at every exchange.
///
/// ## Outbound, and that is why the daemon's answer does not transfer
///
/// `fastcached` REQUIRES a credential of its clients and answers that question with
/// a shared auth source behind its protocol handlers. This worker does the opposite:
/// `--requirepass` here is presented to the shared cache behind `--upstream` and is never
/// checked against anybody. The two are different shapes of the same word, and reaching
/// for the daemon's type would put an inbound policy object on an outbound path
/// ([#404](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/404)).
///
/// ## To `--upstream` alone
///
/// It is that cache's secret, so it goes nowhere else. A scheduler checks no password --
/// this machine's credential there is its node proof -- and a round that presented one
/// anyway handed the secret, in the clear, to every scheduler it dialled and to every
/// endpoint a `NotLeader` named; `Cc::ExchangeWithScheduler` takes no credential for that
/// reason. An operator verb chooses per endpoint (`OperatorCredentials`) and hands this to
/// `--upstream` alone, and a cordon asks this machine's own node, which checks none.
///
/// ## Why a seam rather than three values
///
/// The secret is a shared one across a fleet, so rotating it is an operator task
/// rather than an emergency, and it used to mean restarting every worker. Making it
/// reloadable is only half the job: three call sites took a **copy** at construction,
/// and a rotation reaching two of them is a process running a configuration no file
/// describes -- in the one area where the symptom is an authentication failure
/// nobody can reproduce, on a machine nobody is watching.
///
/// So there is one place a `Cc::Credential` is derived from a `NodeConfig`, and every
/// site that presents one holds a reference to this interface instead of a value.
/// That is the type system doing the work: a reference of this type cannot go stale,
/// because it holds no secret to be stale about. A site that wanted a fixed one would
/// have to construct a `Cc::Credential` of its own, which is what the seam case in
/// `NodeCredential_test.cpp` refuses -- `ctest -R node-credential-tests` or, directly,
/// the `[node][credential][seam]` tag. The guard is a scan rather than the type, because
/// nothing forces a site to reach for the seam at all, and forgetting to must not read
/// the same as deciding not to.
///
/// **Named by its TAG and not by a phrase, because the phrase sent a reader looking for
/// a check that does not exist.** This said `node-credential-seam`, which matches no
/// ctest registration and no script in the tree -- so somebody grepping for it finds two
/// comments, nine unrelated `*-seam` checks, and concludes the hazard is unguarded. It is
/// guarded; a scan implemented as a Catch2 case walking the sources is simply invisible
/// to a search shaped for `scripts/check-*`.
///
/// Implementations must be safe to call from several threads at once: the node's reactor
/// and the process main thread each reach one.

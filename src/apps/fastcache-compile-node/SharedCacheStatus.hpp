/// - `None` -- nothing named and nothing overriding: not tried.
/// - `Override` -- `--upstream` is read through to instead, and the detail names the machine the
///   setting names, when it names one. Not tried: that leg proves nothing.
/// - `Setting` -- the fleet half's `ReportFor(target)`, which knows how its last attempt went, judged
///   against THIS target and never one it reads again. Without
///   one -- a node keeping no private tier, or holding no identity to prove itself with -- nothing
///   reads through to it, and that is said; a setting it could not use anyway is `Unresolved`.
/// - `ThisMachine` -- this node serves the tier at the endpoint it advertises: `Serving`, or
///   `Unavailable` with the host's reason, or with *not open yet* while the host has still to
///   reconcile the state that named this machine.
///
/// A `switch` over the source rather than a row table, deliberately: the enum is transmitted and
/// carries explicit values with no `Last`, so no `EnumTable` can hold it. A fifth source unhandled
/// here fails the GCC and Clang legs (`-Wall` implies `-Wswitch`, fatal under
/// `PEDANTIC_COMPILER_WERROR`) and the clang-tidy sweep (`clang-diagnostic-switch`, every warning an
/// error). The MSVC and clang-cl legs do NOT fail: neither gets `/WX` or `-Werror`
/// (`PedanticCompiler.cmake`), and cl's C4062 is off even at `/W4`. So a row table would guard no leg
/// more than this does, and one guard fewer than the switch.

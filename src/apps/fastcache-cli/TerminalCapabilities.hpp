/// §9.11, §9.12). A fixture substitutes the record, which is how the ASCII rung is driven without
/// a terminal that lacks Unicode.
///
/// It names nothing from core-cpp: its DA1 and DECRQM answers are translated into
/// `SixelAnswer` and `SynchronizedOutputAnswer` where they are read, in `TerminalEventStream.cpp`.

/// What the terminal said about Sixel graphics, or why it said nothing.
///
/// TRANSMITTED/PERSISTED: no. Private; enumerators may be inserted.

/// dashboard draws no Sixel: a query nobody sent is not a terminal that declined, and a terminal
/// that stayed silent until the deadline is neither.

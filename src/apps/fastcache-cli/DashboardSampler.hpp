/// Reading a live-stats stream without stalling the dashboard.
///
/// **`ILiveSubscription::Open` and `Read` are synchronous and do socket I/O.** Run on the reactor
/// they would stall ticks, input AND quit together -- the loop would freeze at exactly the moment
/// an operator wants out, which is the worst time for a dashboard to stop answering. So each goes off
/// to a pool and the result comes back: `core::async::ResumeOn(pool)`, the call, `core::async::ResumeOn(reactor)`. That is
/// the same two-hop the compile surface already uses for the same reason.
///
/// **The hop back is invisible at every call site**, which is what makes it easy to get wrong and
/// impossible to notice: a frame arrives either way. So the property worth asserting is the THREAD
/// IDENTITY, not the reply -- `FrameOutcome` carries both, and a test reads them rather than inferring
/// anything from the frame.

/// Where one read of a stream ran, and what it produced.
///
/// The thread ids are here because a test cannot otherwise ask the question. A frame that arrived
/// proves nothing about where `Read()` ran, and an implementation that dropped the pool hop entirely
/// would keep every other assertion about this type true.

///
/// Pointers rather than references, and not as a style preference: a coroutine frame outlives the
/// call that created it, so a reference parameter dangles the moment the referent dies before the
/// coroutine resumes. None may be null.
///
/// **The clock is read on the POOL, while the reactor may be parked, so it must read its source on
/// every call.** A clock cached by the loop -- `core::platform::CachedClock`, or simply the reactor's own clock --
/// answers the time the dashboard reactor last woke, and during a `Read()` that reactor is asleep by
/// design. Every rate's denominator would then be off by up to one read, silently: `core::platform::ManualClock` has
/// no cache, so no test can see it. Pass `core::platform::SteadyClock`.
///
/// @param subscription The stream to read.
/// @param clock What stamps the frame. Must read its source on every `Now()`; see above.
/// @param pool Where the blocking read runs. Sized 1: one stream, whose frames stay in order by

/// @param resumeOn Where the caller is resumed before the result is used.

/// be parsed never becomes a reading at all.

/// - A sample that carried no document is `Unreachable`: the stream's source composes every fleet
///   reading with one, so its absence is a composition fault, never a fleet of nothing. Whether the
///   leader could be reached or refused the watcher is the source's to say, as a failed sample.
/// - A document that does not parse is `Protocol`, naming what the parser refused -- a body naming
///   no section among them, since an empty fleet is a claim only a leader can make.

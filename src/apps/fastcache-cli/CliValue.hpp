/// The one result model every `fastcache-cli` command produces and every output
/// format consumes.
///
/// **Why a shared model rather than a renderer per command per format.** This tool
/// answers in five registers -- a human table, JSON, `key=value`, TSV and CSV. Five
/// formats times a couple of dozen verbs is a hundred-odd render sites, and the
/// interesting property is one that has to hold at every single one of them: *absent
/// is not zero*. Written per site it holds until the first site somebody writes in a
/// hurry, and the failure is silent -- a `0` where nothing was reported reads as a
/// fact. So every command builds a `Value` and the formatters walk it, which makes
/// the property structural rather than remembered.

/// What a cell holds.
///
/// **A private enum**: it is never transmitted, never persisted, and no ordinal of it
/// is read from bytes or from a position, so it carries no explicit values. Stating
/// that is not a formality here -- eighteen enums in this tree do have an ordinal on a
/// wire or in a file, eight of them once said nothing about it, and an explicit `= N`
/// on an enum that needs none asserts a contract that does not exist.
///
/// The kind is carried separately from the text because two formats need it: JSON
/// decides quoting from it, and the human renderer right-aligns numbers. Rendering
/// the value to text at construction and keeping the kind beside it is cheaper than
/// a variant, and it keeps the whole model printable.
enum class CellKind : std::uint8_t
{
    /// Nothing was reported for this cell, and that is different from a zero.
    ///
    /// **This is the enumerator the whole type exists for.** A tier the cache does
    /// not run, a field the chosen stats source cannot supply, a worker that has not
    /// stated its endpoint -- none of those is a reading, and a renderer that flattens
    /// them to `0` publishes a claim about the world: `cores 0` says a machine has no
    /// CPU, and a cache that has served no reads has *no* hit rate rather than one of
    /// 0%.
    ///
    /// The converse matters just as much and points the other way: a **counter** is a
    /// tally of events, so zero is the truth about events that never happened and a
    /// counter must render `0` rather than absent. Which of the two a given number is
    /// is the caller's decision -- this type only has to be able to say either.

    /// A string that is valid UTF-8. Quoted by the formats that quote.

    /// document without asking again.

    ///
    /// A cache value is an arbitrary byte string -- `set` accepts one and nothing in
    /// the protocol says it is text -- so `get` can hand back bytes no text format can
    /// carry. The three ways to handle that are to emit them raw and corrupt the
    /// document, to substitute `U+FFFD` and lose them silently, or to encode them and
    /// say so. Only the third is honest, and the rule it follows is the tree's own:
    /// text a peer sent is refused or carried, never *repaired* -- a repair is the
    /// failure that is quiet.
    ///
    /// The caller pairs this with an advisory on stderr and, where the shape allows,
    /// an `encoding` field on stdout, so a machine consumer is told rather than left
    /// to guess. `get --raw` bypasses this type entirely and writes the bytes.

/// called that function and about twenty-nine called this one, and three of those
/// twenty-nine carried bytes off the wire — a memcached key, `ME`'s key, a meta flag
/// value — where no caller can assert anything about the encoding. So a non-UTF-8 KEY
/// rendered as raw bytes and `--format=json` produced a document that was not UTF-8

///
/// The two functions are one function now, rather than the wire-sourced callers being

//
// ONE difference carries that, and it is worth stating narrowly because the obvious
// second reason does not hold: `Write` RETURNS the path it wrote, and
// `ScratchDirectory::Write` returns void on purpose, so that `operator/` is the
// single way to name what was written. Every case below names each file it writes,
// so converting would spell each path twice.
//
// The nesting is NOT a second reason. `root` sits inside `base` because one name
// below is itself a nested path, and it reads like an obstacle -- but #147 records
// the remedy from converting two other copies: move the nesting into the relative
// paths handed to `Write` and `operator/`, and one `remove_all` still takes the
// whole tree. Left in the list, it would argue against that ticket's own approach
// from a file the person doing the sweep will open.
//
// So: a local convenience over the shared fixture rather than a second copy of it,
// on one property. `DirectManifest_test.cpp` uses `ScratchDirectory` directly (#70)
// and needs neither.

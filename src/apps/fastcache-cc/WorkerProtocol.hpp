/// Where a worker's advertised endpoint is read, at the moment it is PRESENTED.
///
/// ## Why a seam rather than a string
///
/// The advertised endpoint is what clients are told to dial, what the scheduler files
/// this worker's registration under, and what a grant's MAC is taken over -- three
/// audiences for one fact. Captured at construction it is a fact as of startup, which
/// is wrong for every node whose address is not known when it starts: one behind a NAT
/// or a load balancer, one on an interface configured after the service, one whose
/// address is meant to be derived
/// ([#1279](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1279)).
///
/// So it is asked where it is presented, exactly as `Node::ICredentialSource` is asked
/// for the credential this worker presents, and for the same reason: **a change that
/// reaches some presentation sites and not others is worse than one that reaches
/// none.** Here the two sites are the registration and the lease check, and their
/// disagreement is not a degraded service -- it is a worker refusing grants the
/// scheduler authentically signed, at an address nobody typed wrong.
///
/// ## What this does NOT loosen
///
/// The endpoint is still **this worker's own**, never one the request states. That is
/// the property the endpoint is inside the MAC to provide -- it stops a token captured
/// on the way to one machine from being replayed against every other machine trusting
/// the same key -- and it is a rule about WHERE the value comes from, not about WHEN it
/// is read. A `LeaseValidator` therefore still takes no endpoint parameter: a caller
/// with one in hand would be holding something the client supplied.
///
/// ## The implementation owes two things
///
/// **Thread safety**, because the heartbeat thread publishes while a compile thread and
/// the node's reactor read.
///
/// **One moment of change.** A value that moved between the registration and the lease
/// check would leave this worker verifying against an address the scheduler has not
/// been told about -- so an implementation changes what it answers at ONE point, with
/// the re-registration, rather than tracking a configuration snapshot independently at
/// each call. `Node::AnnouncedEndpoint` owns that argument on the production side.

/// The whole `LeaseRefusal` rather than its `reason` alone, because the other member

/// and returning the enum on its own allocated those strings and dropped them. They

/// verified -- everything it names is already in the token the caller is holding, in
/// the clear -- so a refusal an operator can act on costs nothing extra.
///
/// **It does not take the endpoint**, and the reason is the DIRECTION the value comes

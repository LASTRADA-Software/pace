/// What a piece of a key is. The byte is folded into the digest ahead of the
/// piece's length, so a value fed as a `Field` can never digest the same as the
/// identical value fed as an `Item` or a `Path`.
///
/// The two lists these distinguish are adjacent and both hold path-shaped
/// strings, so a dependency path must not be able to read as a trailing
/// argument.
///
/// **ORDINALS ARE A SHARED-KEY CONTRACT. Append only; never insert, reorder or
/// reuse.** (#308) The byte goes into the digest, so it is not decoded anywhere and
/// no census of `static_cast<KeyPiece>(...)` can find it — every launcher in a fleet
/// has to fold the same number or the same compile keys differently. Renumbering is
/// the cheap direction (a fleet-wide miss); SWAPPING two is the expensive one, since
/// two pieces this enum exists to keep apart then digest identically and one value is
/// served under the other's key.

    Field = 0x00,    ///< A standalone field.

};

/// The launcher's key grammar: a schema tag, then length-prefixed pieces,
/// folded straight into a 128-bit digest.
///
/// **The schema tag is a constructor parameter and there is no other way to
/// start a digest.** That is deliberate. Every key this launcher computes has to
/// carry a tag naming the schema it was written under, because nothing else in a
/// key describes how the stored value is framed or canonicalized: without one, a
/// change to either would leave old entries matching new keys and being served
/// under rules they were not written by. Making the tag unskippable turns that
/// from a convention three call sites have to remember into something the type
/// system asks for.
///
/// **It is also the whole of the domain separation between the key spaces**,
/// now that the four salt bytes that used to distinguish them are gone (issue
/// #63 — the salts never separated anything, they were four runs of one CRC).
/// `objkey-v7`, `manifest-v7`, `rootbound-v1` and `header-state-v1` differ in length or bytes,
/// so no blob in one domain can equal a blob in another.
///
/// **Every piece is length-prefixed, not separator-terminated**, and that is
/// what makes the whole encoding injective rather than merely usually
/// unambiguous. Terminating a value with a byte that can occur *inside* a value
/// is not a framing: with `Field` writing `value` then NUL, the inputs
///
///     { compilerId = "cc\0d", preprocessed = "x"   }
///     { compilerId = "cc",     preprocessed = "d\0x" }
///
/// produce byte-identical blobs and therefore the same key — two unrelated
/// translation units sharing a cache entry, which is exactly the mis-serve
/// issue #63 is about, reached by a different route. Preprocessed text can carry
/// a raw NUL and a build system can pass an argument containing 0x01, so this
/// was reachable rather than theoretical. Writing `kind`, then the length as a
/// big-endian `u64`, then the bytes makes the blob parseable in principle and so
/// injective in fact, for every possible field content.
///
/// Big-endian for the length because that is the byte order everything else in
/// this protocol writes (`AppendU32` in DirectManifest.cpp), and because a
/// *host*-order length would make the key differ between a big-endian and a
/// little-endian machine — the same cross-machine hazard `Core/MurmurHash3.hpp`
/// closes for its block loads.
///
/// It also removes the need for the tag to avoid any particular byte: the old
/// scheme rested domain separation on tags being NUL-free, a precondition
/// nothing enforced.
///
/// It streams. `ComputeKey` used to materialize its entire blob — a second copy
/// of a preprocessed text running to megabytes — purely in order to hash it. The
/// digest is a pure function of the concatenation, so feeding the pieces in
/// order produces the identical key with that peak allocation gone, on the path
/// where the machine is already busiest. `MurmurHash3_test.cpp` pins the
/// streaming/one-shot equivalence that makes the two spellings interchangeable.

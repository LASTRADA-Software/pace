/// lowering a store policy silently lower a denial-of-service guard.

/// It is a **default**, not the rule: `Unenvelope` takes the ceiling as an argument
/// so each surface passes its own.

/// opening a request and the launcher opening a worker's reply — and both trusted
/// the declared length, so a guard added to either would have been half a fix and
/// the two would have had to agree forever afterwards.
///
/// `Core/Compression.hpp` states the precondition that makes the guard necessary:
/// `originalLen` is "the trusted expected size taken from the record header", and
/// it bounds the output allocation. Off a socket it is neither trusted nor a record
/// header — and `Decompress` **value-initializes** a buffer of that size, so the
/// pages are touched rather than lazily reserved. A `u32` field therefore turns a
/// twenty-one-byte frame into a 4 GiB allocation the surface's byte budget never
/// charged anyone for.
///
/// `Protocol/CompileCacheWire.hpp` already says this is what the field is for:
/// carrying `rawLen` "is what lets a decoder reject a payload whose declared
/// expansion exceeds its cap before decompressing a byte". This implements the
/// guard that comment promised; no decoder in the tree performed it.
///
/// An **Identity** envelope is checked too, and for a reason worth stating: it
/// takes no decompression path at all, so it never reached `Decompress`'s own
/// length check and could declare any length it liked beside any payload. That is
/// not an allocation, but it is a field describing bytes it does not describe, and
/// a receiver that believes it later is the next defect.
///
/// Two entry points rather than one, because the two callers want different
/// containers and neither may pay a copy for the other's. A single public function
/// returning `std::vector<std::byte>` was tried and cost the *text* caller a copy it
/// never used to pay: an `Identity` source builds its `std::string` straight out of
/// the frame, so routing it through a `vector` first is a second full allocation and
/// memcpy of a preprocessed translation unit, on the path a developer's build is
/// waiting on. (That was once *every* source, because a node negotiated no other
/// codec — see `AvailableCodecs` and #265. It is now the compression-less build's
/// path, which is exactly the one least able to afford a spare copy.) A *generic*
/// public function inverts the same argument the other way: `Decompress` already
/// returns a `vector<std::byte>` sized exactly `rawLength`, which `Unenvelope` moves
/// straight through, while a range-constructing generic result would copy that.

    // VALUE, and its own key is a function of (canonical source, relativized
    // args, toolchain stamp) — none of which the object-key schema touches — so a
    // manifest written by an older launcher is still found, still validates, and
    // still points at an older object. Direct mode is on by default and
    // short-circuits before the preprocessed path, so without this bump the
    // re-key that `objkey-v*` exists to force never happens on the default path:
    // for v2 that meant the Windows entries written while `/EP /P` sent the
    // preprocessed text to a file — the ones carrying no content from the source
    // at all — kept being served indefinitely.
    //
    // v3 has a second, independent reason, and either alone would require it: the
    // key's own construction changed (issue #63 — four salted CRC32C runs over one
    // blob, which carried 32 bits rather than 128, to a real 128-bit digest). A v2
    // manifest is therefore not merely pointing at a v2 object; its key is not
    // reachable by this build at all.
    //
    // v4 moves this tag ALONE, which the lock-step above permits: the coupling is
    // one-way. An `objkey` bump must drag this tag with it, because a manifest
    // points at an object key BY VALUE and would otherwise keep resolving to a
    // pre-bump object. The reverse costs nothing — an unreachable manifest is
    // re-recorded on the next compile and points at objects that are still valid
    // under whatever tag they were written with — so this tag moving did not
    // require the object key to move. (`objkey` reached v4 separately, for issue
    // #64's dependency-set re-key; see ComputeKey for why it was taken rather than
    // forced.)
    //
    // The bump is required because the defect it retires is invisible to the key.
    // A build whose TU source was absolute but whose header paths were relative
    // (a relative `-I`, or a compile run from the source directory) recorded a
    // manifest naming the TU and nothing else: BuildManifest classified the path
    // against the roots before classifying the anchor, and every relative path
    // lies under no root, so every one of them was dropped as toolchain content.
    // This fix changes neither `canonicalSource` nor the args for such a build, so
    // those manifests keep the same key, keep being found, and keep validating —
    // and a direct hit never reaches RecordManifest, so nothing would ever
    // overwrite one. Edit a dropped header and the stale object is served under a
    // zero exit code, indefinitely. Re-keying is the only thing that retires them.
    //
    // v5 is issue #111, and it is the v4 paragraph's argument reaching a second
    // defect by the same route. Issue #104 refuses to cache a compile carrying a
    // drive-relative path under no root, and asks twice — Cc::KeyDependencySet of
    // the paths the compiler actually opened, and Cc::UnkeyableArgument of the
    // command line. The authoritative ask is the first, and it runs AFTER
    // TryDirectMode; the second runs early enough but can only isolate a path an
    // ARGUMENT carries. So a drive-relative header reaching the compiler by some
    // other route — an `#include "C:foo/x.h"` written out in the translation unit,
    // a fused flag spelling PathValueFlags() does not know — is invisible to the
    // early ask, and the late one never runs because direct mode already answered.
    //
    // Such a manifest is invisible to the key for the same reason the v4 ones
    // were: the refusal changes neither `canonicalSource` nor the args, so the
    // entry keeps its key and keeps being found, and ValidateManifest still
    // validates it because the offending path was dropped from the manifest too
    // and there is nothing left to fail on. A stale object under a zero exit code,
    // through the one door #104 could not close without re-keying. Moving this tag
    // is what closes it, and it retires exactly the pre-#104 population: a launcher
    // carrying the refusal never records such a manifest at all, so nothing writes
    // a v5 entry with the defect in it.
    // v6 is the lock-step half of `objkey-v6` (#319): a manifest points at an
    // object key BY VALUE, so leaving this tag behind would keep resolving to
    // pre-bump objects the object tag has just retired. It also retires the hollow
    // manifests that defect produced -- ones recorded from an uncanonicalized hit,
    // naming the translation unit and not one header, which revalidate on the TU
    // alone and serve their object however the headers move.
    //
    // v7 is the lock-step half of `objkey-v7` (root binding), and it would be required
    // on its own. This key is built from the tokenized source path and the relativized
    // arguments and never sees the spelling `__FILE__` expands to, so two checkouts
    // reach ONE manifest, it validates, and a v6 manifest points straight at the
    // producer's object -- the direct-mode half of the defect, and the default path.
    // Only a re-key makes those manifests unreachable; a v7 manifest points at a
    // portable key, which a root-bound object answers with a marker.
    //
    // v8 is #1650 and moved alone: it retires every manifest recorded before #1650, whose
    // hashes were read after the compile, so an edit saved during it paired the new content
    // with the old object. `objkey` did not move, because the objects under their keys were
    // never the defect.

    // an object key of the generation before it.

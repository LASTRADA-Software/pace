/// reconciliation writes and the root scan reads.
///
/// **One list, because "a root and the paths a driver emits are reconciled on both sides,
/// or neither".** The key maps an alias onto a root by RESOLVING it, which accepts any
/// spelling the filesystem agrees with, and the root scan looks for fixed spellings. Two
/// derivations of "which spellings are this root" drifted apart: `RootReconciler` resolved
/// an `-I` spelled wholly in 8.3 short names to `<BUILDTREE>`, so two build directories of
/// one checkout shared a key, while the scan knew only the long spellings, judged the
/// object portable, and the second build directory was served the first one's
/// `__builtin_FILE()` -- measured on `cl` and clang-cl, direct mode on and off.
///
/// So the reconciler RECORDS here, for every path it maps onto a root, an ancestor of that
/// path's spelling for EVERY root any ancestor resolves into -- the lowest resolving TO the
/// root, else the highest resolving INTO it -- walking up the whole spelling, so a second
/// link below the alias does not hide it and an alias running through one root into the
/// other is recorded as both; each ancestor in BOTH spellings, the prefix as spelled,
/// `.` and `..` kept, and its lexical normal form, since which one an object carries
/// depends on the compiler's flags (`cl` collapses under a debug flag or `/FC`);
/// and it maps the path ONLY once that is recorded; a spelling no ancestor of which
/// resolves to a root, or whose spelled prefix leads elsewhere than its normal form, is
/// left unmapped, which costs sharing and never serves a wrong object. `BindCheckout` seeds each part's 8.3
/// short form. The scan reads the list at STORE time, after every mapping the key made.
/// So no spelling reaches the key without reaching the list: `RootReconciler::Translate`
/// has no path to a mapped result that does not pass `RecordAlias`.
///
/// Not thread-safe, and it need not be: one launcher process is one compile, on one thread.

/// Deciding whether two object files are the same compile, when the bytes differ.
///
/// `FASTCACHE_VERIFY` compared object files with a `memcmp`, which is exactly right
/// on ELF and can never succeed on Windows: every MSVC-family driver stamps the wall
/// clock into the COFF header, and a cached object was produced earlier than the
/// fresh compile it is checked against **by construction**. So the one instrument
/// that turns a wrong object from invisible into loud reported a wrong object on
/// every hit, on the platform where the defect it exists to detect was observed
/// ([#493](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/493)).
///
/// **The measurements this is built on, the reasoning, and the two conclusions that
/// are easiest to get backwards live in ONE place**:
/// `.agent/rules/compile-cache.md`, "An object file is not a byte string". They are
/// not restated here -- a figure others refer to belongs where they point at it,
/// never copied. The two worth knowing before reading this file:
///
/// - ELF keeps the byte comparison. This is a platform gap, not a total failure.
/// - `.debug$S` and `.chks64` are volatile in the PATH, not in time, and the
///   verifier holds the path fixed -- so they are **not** excused, or a hit served
///   from another checkout goes unreported.
///
/// The one normalised region is therefore a single header field, whose offset is the
/// only thing the layout table is consulted for. **Parsing never grants an excuse
/// beyond it** -- the section walk exists solely to say where a difference was, so a
/// parser defect can make a message vague and cannot make a wrong object pass.

/// What comparing two object images found.
///
/// Four answers and not three, because `Unsupported` is the one that must not be
/// folded into `Different`: "this is not what the compiler produces" and "this
/// program cannot read this format" are opposite claims, and reporting the second
/// as the first is the defect this file was written to remove.

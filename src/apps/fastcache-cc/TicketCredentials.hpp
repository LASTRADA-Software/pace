/// later exchange. The other is the `missing` half of each failed exchange's
/// `PresentedCredential`, which `RecordedReason` records in place of a refusal it causes. Whether
/// the exchange IS refused is its audience's decision: a cache with authentication off serves it,
/// one backed by a node refuses it `NotAMember`. What a refusal then costs is the caller's

/// while an operator verb fails.

/// is explained exactly as the first one's is.

/// **Precondition: every owner is ONE-SHOT.** The memo never expires, which is sound only because
/// each object lives for one short unit of work -- the launcher's one compile, a node's one operator
/// verb -- so a node started meanwhile is asked by the next. A long-lived owner would hold a stale
/// "no node" for its whole life and must not reuse this object: it would need the memo refreshed on

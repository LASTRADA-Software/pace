/// #309 deleted `StreamCodec`'s five `reserve(count)` calls rather than tightening
/// them, and reported the cost as 34-47% on decoding large honest streams with short
/// SSO field strings. That figure is a quantity UNDER CONDITIONS taken once, on a tree
/// that has moved since, so it is re-derived here rather than cited -- and this
/// benchmark is what any replacement bound has to be argued against.
///
/// **It measures the shipped `Decode`, not a stand-in.** The blob comes from the real
/// `Encode`, so a change to either side moves this number; a hand-rolled byte string
/// would keep reporting after the format moved under it.
///
/// The shape is the ticket's: MANY small elements, because the cost it describes is
/// repeated geometric growth at small sizes rather than the final capacity. Field
/// strings are deliberately inside libstdc++'s 15-char SSO buffer, which is what makes
/// the in-memory cost several times the wire cost -- a 4-byte wire field becoming a
/// 32-byte `std::string` is the amplification that stops `reserve(count)` from being
/// the free answer even though #309 made `count` safe.

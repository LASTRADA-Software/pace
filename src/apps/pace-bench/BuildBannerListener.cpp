/// The banner is printed ONCE per executable, by a Catch2 listener
/// ([#1439](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1439)).
///
/// ## Why a listener and not each bench file
///
/// The build configuration is a property of the BINARY, not of a benchmark, and this binary
/// has no `main` of ours to put a line in: it links `Catch2::Catch2WithMain`. That is the same
/// shape `cmake/ErrorPopups.cmake` met and settled the same way -- one translation unit
/// reaching every case, rather than a call each case has to remember. `RaftPeerFrameBench.cpp`
/// had already started down the per-file road with a `BuildKind` constant of its own, and it
/// had already gone wrong: it called a build with `NDEBUG` *optimised*, which `NDEBUG` does not
/// say. That constant is gone; this is the one answer.
///
/// ## Why STDERR
///
/// `bench/inproc_bench.py` parses this binary's STDOUT as XML. Measured on Catch2 3.6.0 (the
/// version this tree pins): under `--reporter xml` the XmlReporter redirects the streams a test
/// case writes, so `std::cout`/`std::cerr` from inside a case are captured into `<StdOut>` /
/// `<StdErr>` and the document still parses -- but C stdio and `std::println` are not
/// redirected, and text emitted from inside a `BENCHMARK` body lands inside an open start tag
/// and breaks the parse outright. stderr is safe for any API, so every line this binary writes
/// of its own goes there and the rule needs no exception for how it was written.
///
/// That is the whole binary's rule and not this listener's: **stdout belongs to the Catch2
/// reporter, and every line a bench file writes of its own goes to stderr.** The five bench
/// files were moved onto it with this change, `bench/inproc_bench.py` reads the `SCALING`
/// lines off stderr accordingly, and `ctest -R bench-build-banner-streams` refuses a
/// document whose `<StdOut>` carries any text -- so a `std::cout` added tomorrow fails a
/// check rather than being safe by luck about which reporter is running.
///
/// `testRunStarting` and `testRunEnded` run outside any test case, so they reach the real
/// stderr. `benchmarkEnded` runs inside the case, so under the XML reporter its line is
/// captured into that case's `<StdErr>` -- which is where a figure's own marker belongs
/// anyway. `ctest -R bench-build-banner-streams` asserts both halves, and that the document
/// carries no mixed content.
///
/// The cost of that choice, stated rather than left to be discovered: with the two streams
/// MERGED onto one terminal (`pace-bench 2>&1`), a per-figure line lands between the two
/// halves of the console reporter's own row, because the reporter writes a row's name and its
/// number in two writes with the measurement in between. Separate streams -- which is every
/// redirected, piped or reported run -- are unaffected. Moving these lines to stdout would fix
/// the cosmetics and reopen the parse hazard above, and moving them to a summary at the end
/// would separate a figure from its marker, which is the thing the marker is for.

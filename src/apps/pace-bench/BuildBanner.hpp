/// What build produced the figures this binary prints
/// ([#1439](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1439)).
///
/// A timing is a quantity UNDER CONDITIONS, and the condition that decides whether it is a
/// cost at all is the build. Nothing in this binary's output used to say which build that
/// was, and a Debug bench prints a plausible number -- so an MSVC `cl-release` log was read
/// as "a Debug-build signature" while reviewing #1420, and the only tell was the build
/// directory's name.
///
/// ## The label is not the measurement
///
/// `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` arrives here as a compile definition and is printed as a LABEL,
/// deliberately never as evidence. A CMake variable says what the build system was ASKED
/// for: `CMakeCache.txt` has read `ENABLE_SANITIZER_ADDRESS:BOOL=ON` on a tree where not one
/// object was instrumented, and the configure log agreed with the cache. So every fact this
/// banner draws a VERDICT from is one the compiler itself states, as a predefined macro in
/// the translation unit that asks -- which is why `CurrentBuildConfiguration` is defined in
/// `BuildBanner.cpp`, compiled into this executable with this executable's flags, and not
/// inline in a header some other target could instantiate with its own.
///
/// ## Three answers, because "optimised" is not a fact `NDEBUG` carries
///
/// `RaftPeerFrameBench.cpp` used to spell its own `BuildKind` as `optimised (NDEBUG)`, which
/// is a claim `NDEBUG` cannot support: `-O0 -DNDEBUG` defines it and optimises nothing. gcc,
/// clang and clang-cl all state `__OPTIMIZE__` (measured; clang-cl defines it at `/O1` and
/// `/O2` and not at `/Od`), and `cl` states no optimiser macro at all. So a figure's standing
/// has THREE values -- a cost, not a cost, or unconfirmed -- and an `cl` build that cannot be
/// confirmed says so rather than claiming the better answer.
///
/// ## What is NOT covered
///
/// libc++'s `_LIBCPP_HARDENING_MODE` and MSVC's `_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL` are both set by their
/// standard library rather than predefined by the compiler, so reading them would mean
/// including a library header and comparing against its own level macros. They are absent
/// from `BuildFactTable` on purpose; `_DEBUG` covers the MSVC debug runtime, which is what a
/// CMake `Debug` configuration actually switches, and no row claims to answer for libc++.

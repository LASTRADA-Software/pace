# Cross-depth validation for the compile-cache executor.
#
# Proves the core value-portability guarantee with REAL compilations: an object
# compiled at a DEEP checkout path (mimicking a CI runner nested deeper) is
# STOREd through pace-kv, then FETCHed and localized from a SHALLOW checkout
# path — and every localized /showIncludes header resolves on disk at the
# shallow layout. This is exactly the scenario that poisons Ninja today.
#
# Two modes:
#   -Synthetic         : generate a throwaway source tree (no project source).
#   -CheckoutRoots ... : use a real translation unit from a private checkout,
#                        compiled at a deep temp path, fetched to each real root.
#                        Prints ONLY counts + generic status — never absolute
#                        checkout paths or source — so nothing private leaks.
#
# Nothing this script produces is committed; outputs go to the console and to
# temp directories only.

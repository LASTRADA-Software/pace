    // produced -- so rewriting a macro value to a canonical token would be a key change
    // with no cause behind it.
    //
    // Dropping them from the WORKER line changes no generated code, by the include
    // directories own argument one step further along: dispatch sends PREPROCESSED text,
    // so every macro a definition introduced has already been expanded on the client --
    // including a `#include CONFIG_HEADER` resolved through one, whose file the worker
    // never opens. `-D` is a preprocessor switch and the preprocessing is over. This is a
    // NARROWING of what reaches the worker, not a permission.
    //
    // Before #1481 these were unrecognised, so `CouldNameAFile` refused a path-valued
    // `-DFOO="/abs/path"` -- and with it the WHOLE command line, which is the only safe
    // answer for an argument the walk does not know. That is this project own build
    // (`PACE_SOURCE_DIR`) and any project passing a source root, a config directory
    // or a version string with a slash in it: no dispatch at all, one stderr line per
    // translation unit, and no counter anywhere.

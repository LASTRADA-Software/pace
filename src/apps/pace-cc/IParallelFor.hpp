/// This is the launcher's PARALLELISM seam, and it lives here beside
/// `IProcessRunner` for the same reason that one does: it is an app-local
/// injected seam for an ambient dependency, defined where its consumer lives,
/// with a fake in tests.
///
/// ## Why not `core::async::IExecutor`
///
/// `Pace/Async/IExecutor.hpp` is the **coroutine-resumption** seam -- AGENT.md
/// calls it "the one thing `core::async::ResumeOn` needs" -- and its only method takes a
/// `std::coroutine_handle<>`. Its one implementation, `core::async::ThreadPoolExecutor`, offers
/// nothing else, `core::async::ResumeOn` is usable only from inside a coroutine, and `core::async::Task<T>` is
/// awaitable-only: nothing in this repository can drive a task to completion from
/// synchronous code. The toolchain walk is synchronous startup code, so reaching
/// `core::async::IExecutor` would mean either adding a sync-wait primitive to `Async/` -- which
/// is a deadlock generator the first time somebody calls it from a pool or reactor
/// thread, and the tree already has the rule that names the shape -- or
/// hand-writing coroutine frames and a latch here, which is more bespoke
/// concurrency machinery than a pool rather than less.
///
/// So the seam is shaped for the job. The dependency-injection rule asks that the
/// interface be defined and injected; it has never asked that the interface already
/// exist, and every property it protects holds: no hidden pool, substitutable, no
/// ambient global, and the correctness requirement below is testable without a race.
///
/// **One consumer, one home.** If a second appears, that is the moment to ask
/// whether this belongs in `Pace/` -- not before. A seam moved somewhere
/// shared while it has one caller is a shared thing pretending otherwise.

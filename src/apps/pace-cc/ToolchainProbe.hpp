///
/// ## Why the saving is worth a branch at all
///
/// The launcher is ONE PROCESS PER TRANSLATION UNIT, so a second spawn here is a
/// second spawn per unit of the whole build rather than a one-off. Measured rather
/// than assumed: a 5-unit project built through a real `pace-cc` produced 5
/// records in its `invocations.log`, with a positive control on the launcher being
/// wired (5 `LAUNCHER =` bindings in `build.ninja`; zero would have voided the run).
/// That is also why memoizing the triple buys nothing -- a within-process memo has
/// nothing to hit -- and a cross-process one is unsound, `clang-cl` taking
/// `-fms-compatibility-version` from an MSVC install that can be upgraded beside a
/// byte-identical driver. This is not a cache: nothing is remembered.
///
/// ## What it actually buys, measured end to end on both platforms
///
/// Measured 2026-09-11 by running a launcher built BEFORE this change and one built
/// after against the same translation unit and the same daemon, interleaved A/B so a
/// drift in machine load cannot be attributed to the change, `time.monotonic`, min
/// and median of 20 pairs (15 for clang-cl). Pinned rather than pointed at: these
/// are two machines at one instant.
///
///   platform / driver              before      after      saved
///   ---------------------------- --------- ---------- ----------
///   Windows 11 NTFS, clang++       34.2 ms    22.4 ms    11.8 ms   (34%)
///   Windows 11 NTFS, clang-cl      51.8 ms    40.1 ms    11.8 ms   (23%)
///   WSL2 on DrvFs, clang++ [SLOW] 133.3 ms   112.5 ms    20.8 ms   (16%)
///
/// **The third row is a SLOW PATH and must not be differenced against the first
/// two.** It is a Linux VM reaching a Windows filesystem over DrvFs, where every
/// per-file operation costs an order of magnitude more than native
/// (`.agent/rules/`'s DrvFs measurements say 11x-104x), so its absolute numbers
/// describe that arrangement and nothing else. Read each row against ITSELF: the
/// saving is one driver spawn on every row, and the rows differ in what a spawn
/// costs there. Subtracting 22.4 from 112.5 measures the filesystem.
///
/// The mechanism is confirmed by COUNT rather than inferred from the clock: a
/// logging wrapper standing in for the driver recorded **4 compiler spawns before
/// and 3 after** -- `--version`, the target probe, the preprocess and the compile,
/// with the first of those gone.
///
/// Against ~679 compile edges in this repository's own tree, that DERIVES (not
/// measures) roughly 8 s per Windows build and 14 s per Linux one.
///
/// **#1237 inferred about 20 s per Windows build, and that figure is too high.** It
/// came from #188's ~40 ms, which is the cost of the target probe rather than of the
/// `--version` spawn this removes; the removed spawn measures 8.7 ms in isolation
/// here and ~12 ms inside the launcher. The prize is real and it is about half what
/// the ticket projected.
///
/// One arrangement note, because it cost a wrong answer first: with
/// `FASTCACHE_ADDR`/`SOURCE_DIR`/`BINARY_DIR` unset the launcher declines before it
/// probes anything, so both binaries run one spawn and the measured saving is
/// exactly zero. A timing run that does not set them is measuring a path on which
/// this code never executes.
///
/// ## Why keying on the STEM is sound rather than merely convenient
///
/// `ClassifyCompilerFromBanner` moves a flavour in ONE direction only -- `Gcc` to
/// `Clang`, on positive evidence. So a driver whose NAME already says clang cannot be
/// reclassified, and the row read here, before the banner is known, is the row the
/// caller reads after the correction. A triple parsed from the wrong row is a wrong
/// cache key, and that one-directional property is what rules it out.
///
/// It is also what GENERATES the `cc`/`c++` carve-out, rather than that being a
/// separate rule to remember: those two name a policy rather than a product -- on
/// macOS, Apple clang -- so they classify as `Gcc` here and keep both spawns. `gcc`
/// and `g++` keep them too, their `-###` leading with `Using built-in specs.` rather
/// than a banner (measured, g++ 14.2.0). `cl` has neither flag and is untouched.
///
/// ## The identity is CHECKED, which is why no fingerprint bump rides with this
///
/// Measured 2026-09-11 byte-identical to `--version`'s first line on seven drivers
/// over two hosts and three clang builds -- clang, clang++ and clang-cl from VS 18's
/// LLVM 22.1.3; clang and clang++ from Ubuntu's 20.1.2; clang-22 and clang++-22 from
/// Ubuntu's 22.1.8 -- with `-###` exiting 0 on all seven, which is load-bearing
/// because the fallback below requires a zero exit and an empty banner IS an
/// identity. GCC discriminates the measurement rather than passing it: g++ 14.2.0's
/// `-###` leads with `Using built-in specs.`, so a comparison that could not tell the
/// two apart would have been visible.
///
/// Asserted ACROSS THE CHANGE as well, which is the question the comparison above
/// does not answer: the launcher's own `--print-toolchain-fingerprint`, run from a
/// binary built before this change and one built after, over 11 drivers on one host
/// (2026-09-11, Release, `USE_COMPILER_CACHE=OFF`, both binaries from the same
/// tree). **11 identical, 0 differing** -- 8 clang-family and, as the arm that must
/// not move because it takes no merged path at all, gcc, g++ and gcc-13.
///
/// Three controls, because that table is worthless if the measurement cannot see a
/// difference:
///
///   * DETERMINISM -- the before binary against itself, twice per driver: stable.
///   * DISCRIMINATION -- the 11 rows carry 5 distinct fingerprints, so the
///     comparison is not reporting one constant.
///   * SENSITIVITY TO THE BANNER, which is the one that matters. A stand-in that is
///     `clang-22` in every respect except that it doctors the first line of
///     `--version`, passing `-###` through: the BEFORE binary moves from
///     `347f188d...` to `368004917...`, so the banner really is folded into the
///     fingerprint; the AFTER binary reads `-###` and answers `347f188d...`, the
///     real one. That third reading is also the failure mode drawn in miniature --
///     when the two spellings disagree, the fingerprint moves.
///
/// Eleven drivers on one host is not a fleet, so the property is not left as an
/// assumption. `scripts/check-banner-probe-identity.sh` asks it of every merged-path
/// driver on whatever machine runs the suite, skipping-and-naming where there is
/// none. **That check is what stands in for the bump.** Bumping unconditionally
/// would discard every stored object to record a change that -- if the lines really
/// are identical -- did not happen; the check costs a few spawns and turns the
/// remaining doubt into a red build on the first platform that breaks it. A driver

/// whoever owns the fleet rather than being absorbed by adjusting the check.

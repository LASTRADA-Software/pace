/// targeting MSVC) is never passed, because a worker opens no header from it for a
/// preprocessed compile, and passing it split machines on an installed VS language
/// pack's IntelliSense XML (#1656). A banner alone is what the cache key
/// already uses, and it is too weak here: two machines can print an identical
/// `--version` while resolving different libstdc++ headers, and for *distribution*
/// that produces a silently wrong object rather than the stale path a replay guard
/// can probe. The headers alone are too weak in the other direction: two compilers
/// can share a header tree and generate different code from it.

/// **The driver GRAMMAR is folded in too**, and it is the third independent question:
/// `clang-cl`, `clang++` and `clang` from one LLVM install print the same banner and
/// own one include tree, so the two inputs above cannot tell them apart — and a worker
/// looks a toolchain up by fingerprint, runs *its* driver, and appends the client's
/// arguments verbatim, so a GNU driver serving an MSVC-spelled job reads `/std:c++20`
/// as a filename ([#226](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/226)).

/// reason that function gives.

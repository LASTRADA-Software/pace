/// Write the dependency record a compile would have written, from paths somebody
/// else discovered.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// A remote worker compiles **preprocessed** text. Preprocessed text has no
/// `#include` left in it, so the worker's compiler reports no dependencies —
/// there are none to report. The build system, meanwhile, asked for them: Ninja
/// reads a depfile (or `/showIncludes` under `deps = msvc`) and uses it to decide
/// when this translation unit must be rebuilt.
///
/// Handing back an object with no dependency record is therefore not a missing
/// nicety, it is the same defect the hit path already guards against in as many
/// words: the build sees no header dependencies for this TU and **stops rebuilding
/// it when its headers change**. That is a wrong build with a zero exit code, and
/// it persists until someone cleans.
///
/// The client already has the answer. Its own preprocess probe opened every one of
/// those headers to compute the cache key, and `SourceProbe::dependencyPaths` is
/// exactly the set the local compile's depfile would have listed. So the client
/// reproduces the record rather than the worker inventing one.
///
/// ## Why the paths are not rewritten here
///
/// These are the paths *this machine* resolved, and they are being written into
/// *this machine's* build directory for *this machine's* build system to read. They
/// are deliberately not canonicalized: a token like `<SRCROOT>/inc/a.hpp` is what a
/// STORE carries, and Ninja cannot stat it. Canonicalization happens on the way
/// into the cache, and localization on the way out — neither belongs on the local
/// filesystem path this build is about to consume.
///
/// The `..` collapse Ninja's length limit needs does not belong here either, for a
/// different reason: it is not about what a path MEANS, it is about what a consumer
/// will accept, so it applies once at the emit seam over the rendered bytes rather
/// than per renderer. This file stays a pure renderer and `NotePathCollapse.hpp`
/// holds that rule for every path that reaches a build system, not just this one.

/// Render a GNU-style depfile.
///
/// `<target>: <dep> <dep> ...`, one dependency per continued line, in the shape
/// `-MD` produces. Spaces inside a path are escaped with a backslash, as make
/// requires — a path containing one is otherwise read as two dependencies, and the
/// second is a file that does not exist, which makes the build rebuild forever.
///
/// The target is spelled exactly as the caller gives it, which must be exactly the
/// `-o` path the build passed: Ninja compares the depfile's rule target against
/// what it asked for and fails outright ("expected depfile ... to mention ...")
/// when they differ, while make silently matches no rule and drops every
/// dependency.
///
/// @param target The rule target, i.e. the object path the build asked for.
/// @param dependencyPaths The headers, as the driver spelled them.
/// @return The depfile text, ending in a newline.

/// Render MSVC `/showIncludes` notes.
///
/// One `<marker> <path>` line per dependency, which is the form Ninja parses under
/// `deps = msvc`. Emitted on the stream the build expects them on by the caller;
/// this only produces the text.
///
/// No nesting indentation is reproduced. `cl` renders inclusion depth as a run of
/// blanks BETWEEN the marker and the path (see `PathCanon::IncludeNoteMarkerEnd`
/// for the measurement), and the probe's flattened set no longer carries that
/// structure — but nothing consumes it: Ninja's parser takes the path after the
/// marker and ignores the blanks that separate them, which is the same rule
/// `IncludeNotePath` implements on the reading side.
///
/// ## Why the marker is a parameter and has no default
///
/// The reader's marker and the writer's marker answer **different questions**, and
/// this function is the writer. `IncludeNoteMarker` is the literal English
/// `"Note: including file:"`, and what these lines have to match is not that — it
/// is the build's `msvc_deps_prefix`, which CMake took from the *actual* compiler.
/// On a Visual Studio carrying a language pack those differ, so a dispatched
/// compile emitted notes Ninja did not recognise: no dependencies recorded for the
/// translation unit, and the next header edit did not rebuild it
/// ([#700](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/700)). A **wrong
/// build under a zero exit code**, reached through the build graph rather than
/// through the cache — which is why it is the opposite direction from
/// [#692](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/692) and worse.
///
/// **Ninja matches the literal string and knows nothing about languages**, and it
/// takes a localized prefix as readily as the English one — so neither the bug nor
/// the fix needs a localized compiler to reach. That is measured rather than
/// assumed, over three cases (matching, mismatched, localized-matching), by
/// `scripts/probes/ninja-msvc-deps-prefix.sh`. The figures live there and only
/// there: the probe ASSERTS its own recorded table, so it is the one copy that
/// cannot go stale unnoticed, and restating it here would be a second thing to be
/// wrong.
///
/// The marker is therefore **required and undefaulted**. A default argument would
/// let the next call site omit the build's prefix and silently reintroduce exactly
/// this defect — the same reasoning `ReportedDependencies`' deleted default
/// constructor applies one file away. It also means this translation unit no longer
/// spells a marker of its own at all: the producer cannot drift from its parser
/// because it has nothing to drift *with*. The single definition stays
/// `IncludeNoteMarker`, reached as the default at the one place the launcher reads
/// its environment.
///
/// @param dependencyPaths The headers, as the driver spelled them.
/// @param marker The prefix these notes must carry, i.e. the build's
///        `msvc_deps_prefix`. `IncludeNoteMarker` when the build never said
///        otherwise.
/// @return The notes, each line ending in CRLF; empty for an empty set.

    // roots, `ClassifyAgainstRoots` calls every such path toolchain, all of them

    // closed on the produce side now, in three places: `RecordManifest` refuses when
    // a reported path is not readable as text, and `BuildManifest` refuses both when
    // paths were reported and every one dropped (`NoProjectDeps`) and when no
    // dependency record was observed at all (`DepsNotObserved`, issue #512 -- which
    // used to be the caller's own early return, one translation unit away and
    // invisible from `DirectManifest.cpp`). So this case builds the hollow manifest

    // The `Observed({})` below is a LIE this fixture tells deliberately, and it is

    // record, and would be refused. Spelling the lie explicitly is what keeps the
    // next reader from "repairing" the fixture into a state that proves nothing.
    //
    // What it characterizes is therefore the VALIDATOR, not a live launcher path:
    // `ManifestAssertsNothing` is `entries.empty()`, a TU-only manifest is not
    // empty, and so a hollow manifest that reached the validator by any other
    // route -- decoded from a store an older or foreign producer wrote, say --

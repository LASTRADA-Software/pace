/// Preprocessing an MFC translation unit costs ~1.4 s because it expands ~25 MB
/// of headers; hashing the ones that can actually change costs ~18 ms. The
/// manifest is what makes that trade available: on a miss the launcher records
/// the include set, and on the next compile it re-hashes that set and reuses the
/// result when every hash still matches.
///
/// **Two tiers, and why.** Of a real TU's 635 unique headers, 476 come from the
/// immutable toolchain (MSVC/ATLMFC, the Windows SDK, vcpkg) and account for 24
/// of its 25.6 MB. Hashing them individually costs 91 ms and — worse — their
/// absolute paths lie outside the build's roots, so PathCanon cannot canonicalize
/// them and a manifest naming them would be machine-specific. They are therefore
/// covered collectively by `toolchainStamp` (the compiler identity), not by
/// per-file entries. The remaining 159 project headers all live under the source
/// root, canonicalize to `<SRCROOT>/...` tokens, and are hashed individually.
///
/// That split is what keeps a manifest **portable**: every path it names is a
/// canonical token, so a manifest produced on one machine validates correctly on
/// another with a different checkout location. (sccache's equivalent direct mode
/// is restricted to local disk storage for exactly the reason this split avoids.)

/// What the launcher does with a FETCH, as a function of what came back.
///
/// The file is separate from `main.cpp` for the reason `HitVerification.hpp`,
/// `CacheProtocol.cpp` and `RootReconciler.cpp` are: **`main.cpp` is in no test
/// target** ([#370](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/370)), so
/// every decision made there is unreachable from the suite.
/// `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` cites that fact in four separate places as the reason
/// something cannot be tested, which is the measure of how much has accumulated
/// behind it.
///
/// [#909](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/909) is the ticket,
/// and what makes it more than "some code is untested" is that **two shipping
/// blockers on one branch were both invisible for exactly this reason, and both were
/// caught by review rather than by a test.** Both are fixed; this is the half that
/// stops the next one being invisible too.
///
/// ## The one that costs every key in every fleet cache at once
///
/// An undecodable fetched value must be answered by **compiling and STORING OVER
/// IT**, never by compiling plainly. A `CompileValueVersion` bump does not move a
/// key -- only `objkey-v*` does, and a generation is deliberately not that -- so a
/// value of the previous generation sits under the exact key the new build computes.
/// Answer it without a store and it is fetched, refused, and never overwritten: on
/// every later build, for every key, forever. That is not the one cold cache a
/// generation bump promises but a **permanently dead** one, presenting as a slow
/// build with a `--show-stats` reason nobody reads.
///
/// The distance between the two behaviours is one `return` against one fall-through,
/// in a branch whose difference is invisible on any machine whose cache happens to
/// hold the current generation -- which is every developer machine, every time,
/// until the day of an upgrade.
///
/// ## Why an OBSERVATION enum rather than a struct of the raw facts
///
/// The obvious shape is `{ kind, isHit, decoded, disposition }` with three fields
/// documented as meaningful only when an earlier one holds. That is a state
/// collapse waiting to be read wrong: it can represent `decoded == true` on a miss,
/// and nothing would say which of the two the reader meant. The enumerators below
/// are the states the launcher can actually be in, so an impossible combination
/// cannot be spelled -- and `ObserveFetch` is the ONE place that folds the raw facts
/// into one, so there is a single line to get right rather than a branch per caller.

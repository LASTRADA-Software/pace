/// Collapses every spelling of one filesystem location to a single one.
///
/// This is the launcher's PATH-IDENTITY seam, and it exists because every root
/// test in the launcher is a comparison of SPELLINGS rather than of filesystem
/// identities: one rule, `PathCanon`'s segment-boundary prefix test, reached
/// through `RelateToLayout` by `Cc::ClassifyAgainstRoots` — and so by the keyed
/// dependency set, the manifest and the replay guard — and through
/// `CanonicalizeOne` by the token rewrite. (Being ONE rule is issue #562; being a
/// spelling comparison is what this seam is about, and is unchanged by it.)
/// A comparison form that lowercases and unifies separators
/// still cannot tell that `C:\Users\RUNNER~1\p\inc\h.h` and
/// `C:\Users\runneradmin\p\inc\h.h` are the same file, so a root spelled one way
/// matches nothing a driver spelling it the other way emits.
///
/// That is not hypothetical and not limited to 8.3. Measured on a GitHub
/// `windows-2025` runner, where `%TEMP%` is the short form, the two MSVC drivers
/// disagree **within one build**: `cl` resolves an include through the filesystem
/// and reports the LONG name, while `clang-cl` echoes the spelling it was handed
/// and reports the SHORT one. A `subst` drive, a junctioned build tree, a
/// symlinked checkout and a UNC share reached by drive letter all do the same
/// thing. The failure is silent three times over — the keyed dependency set is
/// empty, the replay guard skips every path it exists to probe, and the stored
/// value keeps the producing machine's absolute paths — so the launcher reports
/// ordinary hits while a moved header keys identically (issue #66).
///
/// The fix is to run BOTH sides through the same function: the layout roots once
/// at startup, and every path a compiler emits before it is compared against
/// them. Resolving only one side is strictly worse than resolving neither — it
/// breaks the driver that was previously working — which is why this is a seam of
/// its own rather than a call sprinkled at each comparison. It is also why
/// `DirectManifest`'s warning against `weakly_canonical` does not apply here: that
/// warning is about rewriting one side of a comparison, and this rewrites both.
///
/// It lives in the launcher, not in `PathCanon`, on purpose: `PathCanon` also
/// runs on the DAEMON, over a producing machine's roots that do not exist there,
/// so it must never touch a filesystem. See `CompileCacheHandler::HandleStore`.

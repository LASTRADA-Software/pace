// pace-cc — an sccache-style compiler launcher over the pace-kv 0xFC
// compile-cache protocol.
//
// Invoked as `pace-cc <compiler> <args...>` (e.g. via
// CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER). On a cache HIT it reproduces the object file
// and replays the compiler's stdout/stderr (localizing /showIncludes header
// paths to this machine's layout) so the build behaves as if it compiled. On a
// MISS it has a worker compile it when a scheduler is configured and otherwise
// runs the real compiler, stores the canonicalized result, and passes the output
// through. A cache error does not end the invocation — the compile is still
// dispatched, because a cache and a compile fleet are two services and an answer
// about one is not an answer about the other — and (when PACE_VERBOSE is
// set) it prints a one-line diagnostic. The build never breaks because the cache
// is unavailable, and it does not stop distributing either.
//
// Config (environment):
//   PACE_ADDR       host:port of the cache; defaults to 127.0.0.1:6674,
//                        empty disables caching
//   PACE_SOURCE_DIR checkout source root (for keying + canonicalization)
//   PACE_BINARY_DIR build output root
//   PACE_PREFETCH_GROUP     optional prefetch group id (default "default")
//   PACE_VERBOSE    if set, print fall-back diagnostics to stderr
//   PACE_NO_STATS   if set, do not record invocations to the statistics log
//   PACE_NO_DIRECT  if set, disable direct mode (always preprocess)
//   PACE_TIMEOUT    deadline for one WHOLE cache exchange, request to last
//                        byte of the reply (default 10s; 0s = unbounded)
//   PACE_DISPATCH_TIMEOUT
//                        deadline for one whole COMPILE exchange with a worker
//                        (default 10min; 0s = unbounded). Separate from the
//                        one above because a compile is bounded by how long a
//                        compiler runs, not by a round trip (#223).
//   PACE_DISPATCH_IDLE
//                        deadline on SILENCE during that exchange (default 30s;
//                        0s = unbounded). All three are durations. A running compile pulses at its
//                        client every few seconds, so this bounds how long the
//                        worker may say NOTHING -- the one failure keepalive
//                        cannot see (#245).
//
// The statistics log is located from the usual per-user state variables rather
// than one of our own: LOCALAPPDATA on Windows, else XDG_STATE_HOME or HOME.
//
// Run `pace-cc --help` for the flag and environment reference, and
// `--show-stats` for the recorded per-machine cache statistics. The accepted
// flags live in one table in LauncherCli.cpp, which also renders that help.
//
// Contains no project-specific data; it compiles whatever it is pointed at.

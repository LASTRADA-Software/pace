/// spawn arm64 executables: a child process is not bound by its parent's emulation.
///
/// So `Platform/HostInfo`'s `HostFacts::architecture` answers the OPPOSITE question

/// a scheduler matches a worker to a job by what its own code executes as. That
/// reasoning is correct there and does not transfer here: a compiler is a separate
/// process, so which compiler binaries this machine can run is a fact about the
/// MACHINE. Both questions are live and they have different answers.

/// One seam rather than four, because the question is one question: a Visual
/// Studio install is a registry value naming a directory, a version file inside
/// it, a subdirectory named after that version, and a `cl.exe` beneath that -- and
/// splitting those across a filesystem interface, a registry interface and an
/// environment interface would mean a layout row could not be tested end to end
/// without assembling three fakes.
///
/// **The reason it is a seam at all** is that none of the layouts this has to get
/// right can exist on the machine running the tests. A Visual Studio install, a
/// Windows SDK's `Installed Roots`, an Xcode toolchain, a version-suffixed GCC
/// prefix and an MSYS2 root are five mutually exclusive shapes; a discovery that
/// consulted the real host directly would be tested on whichever one the runner
/// happened to have, which is to say tested nowhere. `ScriptedToolchainHost`
/// (ToolchainHostTestUtils.hpp) is the whole point of this interface, not a
/// convenience laid over it.
///
/// Every method is total and reports absence rather than failing: a directory that
/// is not there lists nothing, a registry value that is not there is `nullopt`.
/// Discovery is best-effort by construction -- a machine simply does not have most
/// of these layouts -- so an error channel would carry "this host is not a Mac" on
/// every call and mean nothing.
///
/// **Implementations must tolerate concurrent calls.** The compile node
/// fingerprints several toolchains at once and every one of them asks this seam
/// about the machine, so the same object is reached from up to four threads. Both
/// implementations already are: the real one holds nothing across a call, and the
/// scripted one is written before any case reads it. Stated here because the
/// requirement is otherwise invisible at the point somebody writes a third.

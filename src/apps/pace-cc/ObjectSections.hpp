/// `RootBinding` walks every format this cache stores to decide which bytes a linked
/// program can see. The COFF half used to live privately inside the first; the second

/// copy that drifts (`StubCoffTestSupport.hpp` records two that already had).

/// **Nothing here decides anything.** A section is reported by name, extent and the

/// a permanent "cannot read" nobody would investigate. A third layout is a row.

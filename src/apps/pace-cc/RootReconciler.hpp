/// `PathCanon::Layout` takes roots WITHOUT one — `IsSegmentPrefix` requires the
/// byte after the root to be a separator, so `/x/build/` matches nothing under
/// `/x/build` — and a build system that exports one is doing nothing wrong. Left
/// in place it is worse than a no-op in both directions: nothing under that root
/// canonicalizes, so the stored value keeps this machine's absolute paths; and
/// once reconciliation gives the path a second chance through the resolved root
/// (which the resolver returns without the separator), `JoinLocalized` puts the
/// root back with a separator of its own and emits `/x/build//a.o` — a depfile
/// rule target the build system did not ask for, which Ninja rejects outright and
/// make matches against no rule at all.
///
/// A bare root is left alone: `/` and `C:\` ARE their trailing separator, and
/// trimming `C:\` to `C:` would also flip the separator style `JoinLocalized`
/// derives from it.
/// @param root A layout root as the environment supplied it.
/// @return The root with any trailing separators removed.

/// Rewrites a path a compiler emitted into the spelling THIS BUILD uses.
///
/// There are two spellings of every root and the launcher needs both, for exactly
/// opposite reasons:
///
/// - **Matching** has to use the spelling the FILESYSTEM reports, because that is
///   what a driver reports. `cl` resolves an include through the filesystem and
///   prints the long name while clang-cl echoes the short one it was handed; a
///   `subst` drive, a junction and a symlink all split the two the same way. When
///   the root does not share a spelling with what the driver emits, the keyed
///   dependency set is empty, the replay guard probes nothing, and the stored
///   value keeps this machine's absolute paths — silently (issue #66).
/// - **Emitting** has to use the spelling the BUILD SYSTEM uses. A replayed
///   depfile's rule target must be byte-identical to the `-o` path the build
///   passed, or Ninja fails outright ("expected depfile ... to mention ...") and
///   make matches no rule at all and quietly loses every header dependency.
///
/// Translating INTO the as-given spelling satisfies both at once, and leaves one
/// layout for everything downstream: the roots on the wire, the key, the manifest,
/// the replay guard and the localized regions all keep speaking the spelling the
/// build system exported, exactly as they did before any of this existed. The only
/// thing that changes is that a path the driver spelled some other way now arrives
/// already translated.
///
/// The translation is PathCanon's own two operations — canonicalize against the
/// resolved roots, localize into the as-given ones — rather than a prefix test
/// written out again here, so it cannot come to disagree with the rule everything
/// else applies.

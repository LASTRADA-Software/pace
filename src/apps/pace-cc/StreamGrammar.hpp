/// The grammar to tag a stored TEXT REGION with, per compiler flavor.

/// Both console streams of one compile carry the same tag, and that tag must cover every line
/// language the stream can carry -- a line its grammar cannot see is stored verbatim, and a hit
/// then replays the path of the checkout that STORED it. On a machine with several checkouts
/// that path resolves to a different tree at a possibly different revision, so the line number
/// lands on unrelated code and the developer edits the wrong one.
///
/// - **The GNU family** writes diagnostics and no `/showIncludes`, so `GccDiagnostics` (#202).
/// - **The MSVC family** writes notes AND diagnostics, and the channel follows the FLAG rather
///   than the driver: `cl` and `clang-cl` put the notes on stdout under `/c` and on stderr under
///   `/EP` (#825). So both streams need both languages, which is `MsvcStream`. It was
///   `ShowIncludes` until generation 6 of the stored value, and every MSVC-family warning, error
///   and `note:` a hit replayed carried the producer's path. `.agent/rules/compile-cache.md`
///   holds the channel table; this must not become a second home for it.
///
/// Here rather than in `main.cpp` so the WIRING is testable: a correct grammar nothing tags a
/// region with is exactly the defect generation 6 closes -- `MsvcDiagnostics` existed, was
/// unit-tested, and reached no production region.
/// @param flavor The compiler family.
/// @return The grammar both stored stream regions carry.

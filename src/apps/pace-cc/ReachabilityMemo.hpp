/// - a STALE "unreachable" entry costs a local compile, for at most one TTL, and then
///   heals on its own -- never a wrong object, only a slower build for that window. For
///   a WORKER entry it costs less: the scheduler grants ANOTHER worker, and the compile
///   goes local only when every matching worker is excluded (`AllExcluded`);
/// - a MISSING or lost entry costs one extra dial, which is exactly what the launcher did
///   before the memo existed.
///
/// Neither direction produces a wrong answer that looks right. And the memo errs NARROW
/// about what it believes: an entry is written only for `TransportFailure::Unreached`,
/// where no connection was ever made. `PeerLost`, `Expired` and `Silent` each reached a
/// live peer, which is not a machine that is down, so they write nothing.
///
/// **Stamps are WALL clock, in unix milliseconds**, because a steady clock is not
/// comparable across processes once the machine reboots or sleeps. So an age is a
/// subtraction that can come out NEGATIVE when the clock steps back, and that is its own
/// outcome, `MemoAge::FromTheFuture`, decided in `AgeOf` and nowhere else -- never a
/// clamp, which would make it read as the freshest entry there is. A future stamp is
/// treated as stale. `now` is always the caller's, read from an injected
/// `core::platform::IWallClock`; the memo reads no clock of its own.
///
/// **Concurrency is tolerated rather than locked.** Two launchers doing a

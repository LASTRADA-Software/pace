/// - **The stream is the launcher's own probe, never the user's compile output.**
///   Measured: `#pragma message("see C:\\ci\\deep\\src\\a.h")` emits exactly
///   `see C:\ci\deep\src\a.h` on the same stream -- a line ending in a real
///   dependency-shaped path carrying no marker at all, from which this rule would
///   learn the prefix `see `. No localization is needed for that to exist, so the
///   heuristic is a design constraint on WHERE it may run rather than an argument
///   against it. The probe TU includes one header and defines no macros, so nothing
///   but the note can produce such a line.
/// - **Trailing blanks are trimmed off what is learned.** `cl` renders inclusion
///   depth as blanks BETWEEN the marker and the path (see
///   `PathCanon::IncludeNoteMarkerEnd` for the measurement), so a derivation that kept
///   them would learn a prefix whose length depends on which note it happened to read.
///   `PathCanon::IncludeNoteMarker` is spelled without a trailing space for the same
///   reason.
/// - **Nothing may precede the marker**, which is the anchor every reader in this tree
///   shares since [#1270](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1270).
///   A candidate line with leading blanks is refused rather than trimmed.
///

/// producing checkout's absolute paths, while a wrongly-matched one re-spells a line no
/// consumer will look for.
///
/// The path comparison is case-insensitive and treats `/` and `\` alike, which is

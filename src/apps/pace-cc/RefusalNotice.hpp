/// **The launcher is a per-translation-unit process with no sink**, which is the
/// whole difficulty. A refusal that will recur for every unit of a build is not one
/// an operator should have to run `--show-stats` to discover -- but a line per unit
/// is thousands of lines and gets filtered, which is worse than silence because it
/// buries everything else too.
///
/// So a persistent refusal is announced at most once per interval, and a transient
/// one is not announced at all. Which is which is a COLUMN, because the distinction
/// is a property of the code rather than of the call site: `UnsupportedVersion` is
/// true of the daemon and will be true of the next unit and the one after, while a
/// `MalformedValue` is about one stored object and says nothing about the next.
///
/// The motivating case is #815, recorded in the rulebook: an 0.1.0 daemon refused a
/// wire-3 launcher, everything degraded exactly as designed, and the only trace was
/// a `STATUS` line and a `--show-stats` tally nobody reads. A whole team built
/// through a cache that was answering "no" to every request, for weeks.

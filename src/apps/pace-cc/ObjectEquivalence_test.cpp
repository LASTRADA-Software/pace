/// uninstalled from under it.
///
/// The only question that survives both is **did an object appear?**
///
/// (`NotSpawned` is a sound guard for its own question and is used correctly
/// elsewhere -- `ProcessRunner` spawns through `posix_spawnp`, which reports an exec
/// failure back to the parent rather than leaking it as a 127 exit, so a genuinely
/// missing binary does report `NotSpawned` on POSIX. It is simply not an answer
/// about whether the tool WORKS.)
///
/// The translation unit is header-free on purpose, which is what makes this runnable
/// without a developer command prompt -- a bare `cl.exe` with no `INCLUDE` compiles
/// it, and still emits the `.debug$S` and `.chks64` records that make MSVC's output
/// worth testing (measured).

/// # An object that names its producer's checkout is not portable, and only the OBJECT can say so
///
/// A cache key is portable across checkouts by design: `<SRCROOT>` stands in for the
/// source root in every argument, the preprocessed text carries no line markers, and
/// a direct-mode manifest keys on the tokenized source path. That is the whole point
/// of the launcher -- and it is exactly why a key cannot see a compile whose OBJECT
/// names the producing checkout in data the program reads:
///
/// - **`__FILE__` under direct mode.** The preprocessor expands it, so the ordinary
///   key's raw preprocessed text does differ between checkouts -- but direct mode
///   short-circuits before any preprocessing, and the manifest key is built from the
///   tokenized source path and the relativized arguments. Two checkouts reach one
///   manifest, it validates, and it points at the producer's object.
/// - **`std::source_location` and `__builtin_FILE`, on EVERY path.** The COMPILER
///   fills those in from the presumed file name, after preprocessing; `/EP` and
///   `-E -P` suppress the line markers that would carry it, deliberately. So the text
///   `ComputeKey` hashes contains no file name at all, and two checkouts share the
///   key with direct mode off as well.
///
/// Measured on `cl` 14.51 over two byte-identical checkouts: the second one printed
/// the first one's path for both, served byte-identical objects (issue record in
/// `.agent/rules/compile-cache.md`, "An object that names its producer's roots").
///
/// No command-line rule can predict it: `__FILE__`, `source_location`, a `#line`, a
/// `/FC`, an `assert` (whose message is the WIDE `__FILE__` on MSVC), or a path-valued
/// macro nobody anticipated all reach the same place. The object is the one ground
/// truth for every mechanism at once, so it is asked.
///
/// ## The mechanism
///
/// At STORE time the launcher -- which holds both the fresh object and the layout --
/// scans the object's program-visible sections for the parts of its own checkout
/// (`ScanCheckout`): the source root, the build tree and the working directory. An
/// object naming none is stored exactly as before, under the portable key, and keeps
/// every cross-checkout hit it ever had. An object naming one is ROOT-BOUND: it is
/// stored under `ComputeRootBoundKey`, which folds the parts it NAMES into the portable
/// key, and the portable key gets a MARKER value in its place that lists those parts. A
/// consumer that fetches the portable key and meets the marker follows it with ITS OWN
/// values for exactly those parts (`ResolveFetchedObject`), which for another checkout
/// is a key nothing stored -- a MISS, whose compile stores that checkout's own
/// root-bound copy. It fails closed and heals itself, and a checkout meeting its own
/// marker HITs its own object.
///
/// Direct mode needs no second mechanism: a manifest records the PORTABLE key, and
/// following it lands on the marker exactly as the preprocessed path does. A dispatched
/// compile needs none either, because its object is written to the build's own output
/// path and stored by the same code as a local one, scanned against THIS client's roots
/// -- a worker compiles `#line`-carrying text naming the client's paths, so its
/// `source_location` names them too.
///
/// ## The marker's format, and why no generation moved
///
/// A marker is an ordinary current-generation `CompileValue` whose object blob is a
/// fixed prefix, a version and the named parts BY NAME (`EncodeRootBoundMarker`), and
/// which carries NO text region. The
/// alternative was a new field in the value, which is a `CompileValueVersion` bump, a
/// conformance row and a `GenerationBumps` entry; it buys nothing here, because:
///
/// - **Every server already stores it correctly.** A value with no text region passes
///   `CanonicalStoredValue` unchanged on every server of this generation, and a server
///   of any other generation refuses it by its leading byte -- the ordinary
///   `ForeignGeneration` refusal, never a verbatim store.
/// - **No launcher that cannot read it can reach it.** Markers live only under keys
///   derived with `objkey-v7`, which this change introduced; a launcher without this
///   code derives `objkey-v6` or earlier and never computes one.
/// - **It cannot be mistaken for an object.** Every stored OBJECT carries two text
///   regions (stdout and stderr, pushed unconditionally), and a marker carries none, so
///   the recogniser asks both and a real object whose bytes happened to spell the magic
///   would still not be one. And no consumer here can materialize a fetched value
///   without passing through `ResolveFetchedObject`, which is the one place that asks.
/// - **A marker this build cannot read is refused, never served.** Anything carrying the
///   prefix is a marker; one whose version or part names this build does not know --
///   `v1`, written by a build that bound every object to the whole checkout -- is an
///   undecodable value, which is compiled and stored over like any other.
///
/// ## Which way the scan fails, and why it errs BROAD
///
/// A spelling this scan does not recognise makes a root-bound object look portable,
/// which serves it into another checkout: **wrong, and looks right** -- the class this
/// launcher exists to never produce. A spelling it over-recognises costs one TU its
/// cross-checkout sharing: a miss. So every choice below takes the broad side:
///
/// - **Both separators, and a RUN of them.** `\` and `/` are one character, and `\\`
///   (a stringized literal, a `#line` directive's escaping) matches as one.
/// - **Case-insensitive, on every layout.** `cl /FC` has lower-cased paths, and macOS's
///   default volume is case-insensitive too.
/// - **Any non-ASCII run matches any non-ASCII run.** A root carrying `ü` is spelled as
///   two UTF-8 bytes, one code-page byte (`cl` converts `__FILE__` to the EXECUTION
///   character set without `/utf-8`) or one UTF-16 unit; each is one wildcard here.
/// - **Narrow, UTF-16LE and UTF-32LE, at every alignment.** `L"" __FILE__` and
///   `assert` on MSVC are UTF-16; `wchar_t` is 32 bits on Linux and macOS. Every
///   alignment rather than only the natural one, which also covers the big-endian
///   spellings for every ASCII character.
/// - **Both roots AND the working directory, each in two spellings.** Absolute as
///   exported (a relative export is joined onto the working directory first -- a relative
///   spelling names no checkout, and `.` would match nearly any object) and as the
///   filesystem resolves it, because a compiler writes whichever spelling it was handed.
///   The working directory is scanned because it is what `cl /FC` absolutizes a relative
///   path against, whatever the roots say: a build whose roots do not cover it otherwise
///   stores an object naming the checkout as portable. Where it IS a root -- the ordinary
///   layouts -- scanning it again costs nothing.
/// - **Everything but debug records.** What is excluded is named, never what is
///   included -- a section nobody anticipated is scanned.
/// - **What cannot be read as bytes is BOUND.** An LTO object (LLVM bitcode, GCC's
///   compressed IR, `cl /GL`'s anonymous object), clang's COVERAGE MAP (`__llvm_cov*`,
///   `.lcovmap$`/`.lcovfun$`, `__LLVM_COV,` -- a zlib stream behind a header, holding the
///   compilation directory and the absolute source; measured on clang 22 under
///   `-fcoverage-mapping`, where the root appears nowhere in plain bytes), device images,
///   and ANY section that is compressed -- flagged so, or opening with a zlib or zstd
///   header -- hide their strings; guessing "portable" about them is the
///   wrong-looking-right side.
/// - **A `?` in the object matches any single character of a root.** `cl` without
///   `/utf-8` writes `?` for a root character its code page cannot hold.
/// - **A format the walk cannot lay out is scanned WHOLE**, header, symbols and all.
///
/// What it deliberately does NOT scan are debug records -- `.debug$S`, `.debug$T`,
/// `.chks64`, DWARF. They name the producing checkout on every compile with debug info,
/// which is #203's accepted cost: counting them would end cross-checkout sharing for
/// every debug build, the alternative this design exists to avoid.
///
/// ## The bound key identifies the CHECKOUT, never the spelling
///
/// `ComputeRootBoundKey` folds each part ABSOLUTE and RESOLVED. It once folded the roots as
/// exported, and a relative export (`.` and `build`) is the same string in every checkout:
/// the marker led a second checkout straight to the first one's bound copy -- measured end
/// to end, `cl /FC`, the second checkout printing the first one's path under
/// `(root-bound: served from key=...)`. Folding the resolved absolute paths makes the key a
/// property of where the compile ran.
///
/// ## ... and only the parts the object NAMES
///
/// It once folded all three parts whatever the object named, and that ended sharing it had
/// no reason to end: a test object's `__FILE__` names the SOURCE ROOT only, and a second
/// build directory of the same checkout -- the same sources, compiled again -- missed on
/// every one of them. Measured by `launcher-replay-e2e` on Linux: 32 misses in the warm
/// build, every one a `*_test.cpp` whose object names no build directory at all, because
/// `-fdebug-prefix-map` maps it away. This is the compile-cache rule that only
/// machine-independent inputs are hashed, applied to the binding: the key folds what the
/// object is OBSERVED to name, so an object naming only the source root hits from any build
/// directory of that checkout, and one naming the build tree or the working directory misses
/// from another -- as it must, since it spells that directory. It still fails CLOSED for an
/// object that names another checkout, and one this scan cannot read is bound to every part.
///
/// The fetch cannot see what the object names before it has the object, so the MARKER
/// carries the set, and a consumer folds its own values for exactly those parts. Two
/// spellings of one directory -- a working directory that IS the build tree -- name both
/// parts, which only folds one more value that agrees in every build that shares it.
///
/// Residuals, recorded rather than rediscovered:
///
/// - A root spelled through an alias the key never MAPPED and that is not its 8.3 short
///   form -- a second `subst` drive the compile line never used, say -- is not found. An
///   alias the key did map is scanned for (`RootAliasList`), which is what keeps the key
///   and the scan from disagreeing about one: the key cannot share an entry across it
///   without the scan knowing it.
/// - A relative path argument that climbs OUT of every root and the working directory
///   (`-I..\inc` from `<checkout>\build` with the source root narrower than the
///   checkout) is absolutized by `cl /FC` to a directory this scan was not given. It errs
///   the unsafe way; the direction is recorded, and resolving each relative argument
///   lexically would close it.

    // matching new keys and being served under rules they were not written by --
    // a silent mis-serve, which presents as a mysterious hit-rate collapse rather
    // than as a miss. Bumping re-keys the cache instead, so stale entries simply
    // miss and are rewritten. ComputeManifestKey's tag moves in lock-step; see
    // the reason recorded there.
    //
    // v2 added the dependency path set, which is what makes a moved header a
    // different key rather than a hit whose depfile has to be re-checked (see
    // KeyInputs::dependencyPaths).
    //
    // v3 is the digest itself (issue #63). Until it, this was four CRC32C runs
    // over one blob distinguished only by a leading salt byte. CRC is affine over
    // GF(2): with `A` the per-byte state-update operator and `S_i` the state
    // after salt `i`, quarter_i XOR quarter_j is `A^len(blob) * (S_i XOR S_j)` --
    // a function of the blob's LENGTH and of nothing else about it. So matching
    // one quarter forced all four, and a key that was 128 bits wide carried 32
    // bits of strength. Equal length is not an exotic condition, it is the
    // ordinary shape of a source edit (`return 1;` -> `return 2;`), and the
    // consequence was not a miss but an unrelated translation unit's object file
    // served under a zero exit code. Measured before the fix: one distinct XOR
    // value across 2000 random equal-length blobs, and a full 32-hex-char
    // collision after 86,125 of them -- the birthday bound for the 32 bits it
    // really had, against ~10^5 entries a shared team cache reaches.
    //
    // v3 deliberately did NOT move when RelativizeArgs learned to tokenize a
    // FUSED object-output path, even though that changed the key of every
    // Windows build. That reasoning is kept, because it is the case for NOT
    // bumping and it stands on its own: the tag versions this CONSTRUCTION and
    // the rules the stored value is written under, and neither moved -- the
    // golden vector did not move for that change either, nor did the value's
    // framing or canonicalization. What changed was one input, for the builds
    // whose command line carried a machine-specific string it should never have
    // carried. Old entries stayed correct in their own terms; they simply
    // stopped being addressed, missed, and were rewritten. A bump could not be
    // reached from there -- an old key can only become a new key by a build
    // literally passing the text `<BUILDTREE>`, and a `/Fo` path that was
    // already relative canonicalizes to itself and does not move at all --
    // while it WOULD have invalidated every POSIX entry, where nothing changed.
    // Direct mode needed no bump for the same reason and not by luck:
    // ComputeManifestKey takes the relativized args too, so a manifest key moves
    // exactly where an object key does, in lock-step, for exactly the builds
    // affected.
    //
    // v4 is issue #64. A dependency path is now classified by what it RESOLVES to
    // rather than by whether it was spelled absolutely, so a relative one tokenizes
    // or drops where it used to be hashed verbatim.
    //
    // On its own that would not have required a bump, by exactly the argument
    // above: it re-keys only the translation units that reported such a path, and
    // their keys differ by construction, so a pre-fix entry becomes unreachable
    // rather than servable under rules it was not written by. The bump is taken
    // anyway, and the reason is worth stating precisely because it is NOT the
    // lock-step rule this comment used to cite. `manifest-v4` moved separately,
    // ahead of this, when BuildManifest learned to resolve a relative dependency
    // instead of dropping it -- and that direction of the coupling costs nothing,
    // as ComputeManifestKey records: an unreachable manifest is re-recorded on the
    // next compile. So nothing forced `objkey` here.
    //
    // What decides it is that the two tags disagreeing is a state nobody should
    // have to reason about later. A cache holding v4 manifests that point at v3
    // objects is correct today and is one careless edit from not being, and the
    // cost of removing the question is a single cold rebuild. The fused-output
    // re-key above, which needed no bump of its own, rides along in the same
    // invalidation event rather than ever costing a second.
    //
    // v5 is issue #111, and NOTHING here forced it. The manifest half is what the
    // issue is about — a manifest recorded before #104's refusal keeps direct-
    // hitting a drive-relative compile, and only a re-key retires it; see
    // ComputeManifestKey. This key's construction, the value's framing and its
    // canonicalization are all unmoved, and the golden vector below moved for the
    // tag and for nothing else.
    //
    // It is taken because the paragraph above is not a remark about v4, it is the
    // standing rule, and it decides this case the same way: two tags sitting
    // numerically apart is a state nobody should have to reason about later. A
    // cache holding v5 manifests that point at v4 objects is correct today under
    // the one-way lock-step and is one careless edit from not being, and the cost
    // of removing the question is again a single cold rebuild — one that the
    // manifest bump has already committed every user to paying, so the object half
    // rides in that invalidation event rather than ever costing a second.
    //
    // Issue #111 recommends the opposite — bump `manifest` alone, on the ground
    // that re-keying objects invalidates every entry on every platform for a
    // clang-cl-only exposure — and asks for that recommendation to be followed or
    // explicitly overruled here rather than silently ignored. It is overruled. The
    // asymmetry it cites is real but it is an argument about THIS invalidation
    // event, weighed once; the tags-apart hazard is carried by every reader of
    // this file afterwards, and unlike a cold rebuild it does not expire.
    // v6 retires every value stored before #319. A compile node served this wire
    // without canonicalizing a stored value's text regions, so those values carry
    // the producing checkout's absolute paths -- and a consumer replaying them
    // hands its build system dependencies naming a tree it will never edit, which
    // no later build can invalidate. The bytes are wrong rather than merely old,
    // and nothing in a value says which kind it is, so the tag is what makes them
    // unreachable. Bumped rather than sniffed: a reader that tried to tell a
    // poisoned region from a sound one would have to call a path with no
    // `<SRCROOT>` sentinel suspect, and 92 of the 93 paths a trivial translation
    // unit reports are toolchain headers that correctly have none.
    //
    // v7 retires every value stored before root binding (RootBinding.hpp). An object
    // naming its producer's checkout -- a `__FILE__` under direct mode, any
    // `std::source_location` on any path -- was stored under a key every checkout
    // computes, so those entries serve another checkout's paths and nothing in a value
    // says which of them do. This construction is unchanged and the golden vector below
    // moved for the tag alone; what changed is where a STORE puts a root-bound object and
    // what a FETCH does on meeting its marker, and an older entry was written by neither
    // rule. `manifest-v7` moves with it, in the lock-step ComputeManifestKey describes --
    // and for a second reason of its own, since direct mode is where the defect lived.
    //
    // v8 retires every value stored before the dependency root (`PACE_DEPS_DIR`,
    // `PathCanon::Layout::dependencyRoot`). This construction is unchanged and the golden
    // vector moved for the tag alone; what changed is what a value's text regions may carry
    // -- a `<DEPROOT>` span a launcher of this generation localizes and an older one would
    // replay verbatim -- and the root-bound marker's part names, which gained
    // `dependency-root`. Bumped so the two generations never exchange an entry rather than
    // relying on their keys differing, which they do only for units that read a
    // dependency. `manifest-v9` moves with it, in the lock-step ComputeManifestKey records.

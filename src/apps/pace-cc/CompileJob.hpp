/// **The compiler.** A job names a *fingerprint*, never a program. The worker maps
/// that fingerprint to a path from its own configuration, and a fingerprint it does
/// not have is refused. This is the single most important property here: a job that
/// could name its own compiler would let anyone who can reach the port run an
/// arbitrary program, which is not a hardening detail but the difference between a
/// build accelerator and a remote shell.
///
/// **Any path.** The client's arguments have already been through
/// `RemoteCompileArgs`, which refuses a command line carrying anything that could
/// name a file. This checks again, on the receiving side, because the two checks
/// protect against different things: the client's protects an honest client from
/// dispatching something that would not work, and this one protects the worker from
/// a client that is not honest. A worker that trusted the client's filtering would
/// be secured by code running on the attacker's machine.
///
/// **Where anything is written.** The object path, the source path and the working
/// directory are all the worker's, inside a scratch directory it creates and
/// removes. Nothing the client sends decides where a byte lands.
///
/// The source *name* is used for exactly one thing: its extension, so the compiler
/// picks the right language. Even that is sanitized rather than trusted.

/// ([#354](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/354)) -- so the

/// the compile port during it must be told "not yet" rather than "wrong toolchain".

/// ([#365](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/365)).

/// What it must never do is decide where anything GOES. The name arrives over a

/// - an extension from the same fixed table as before, defaulting to `.cpp`;
/// - never a Windows reserved device name (CON, NUL, COM1, ...), which on a Windows

/// fails a job: it is a cosmetic input, and refusing over one would cost a compile
/// to gain nothing.

///
/// `DW_AT_comp_dir` is the directory the compiler ran in. It is on no command line, so
/// no cache key can distinguish two producers by it, and a dispatched object recorded a
/// directory a locally mapped one does not, under the same key
/// ([#506](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/506)). One half of
/// the rule the worker needs is a path on THIS machine, which the client has never
/// seen, so the client sends its own directory and its own replacement and this builds
/// the rules.
///
/// ## TWO rules, because WHICH directory the object records is the driver's answer
///
/// Measured on gcc 14.2.0 and clang 20.1.2, one translation unit each way, reading
/// `DW_AT_comp_dir` off the worker's object:
///
/// | preprocess line | the worker's object records |
/// | --- | --- |
/// | `g++ -E` | the WORKER's directory |
/// | `g++ -E -g` | the CLIENT's directory |
/// | `clang++ -E`, `clang++ -E -g` | the WORKER's directory |
///
/// gcc's `-fworking-directory` is implicit under `-g` and emits a line marker naming
/// the preprocessing directory, which the worker's compile adopts; clang emits none. So
/// both candidates are mapped, to the same replacement, and the answer is the same
/// whichever the driver used. **Mapping only this worker's own directory fixes clang
/// and leaves gcc recording the client's UNMAPPED path** — the object comparison every
/// other case in the fleet's end-to-end fixture makes cannot see that, and reading
/// `comp_dir` can, which is why #506's acceptance clause insists on reading it.
///
/// ## What it refuses, and why each refusal is not a silent skip
///
///   - **No directory is not a refusal.** It is the client saying it maps nothing, and
///     a worker that mapped anyway would hand a build that asked for nothing an object
///     naming a directory neither machine has. An empty REPLACEMENT is not that case
///     either: `-fdebug-prefix-map=<builddir>=` maps a root to nothing and is a standard
///     reproducible-build spelling, so the DIRECTORY alone says whether a mapping is in
///     force. Only the reverse — a replacement with no directory — is refused, because
///     it would map everything.
///   - **Any of the three carrying anything but the shape below.** They are peer text
///     that ends up inside an artefact and, before that, on a command line. The set
///     allowed is deliberately narrower than `SafeSourceName`'s in one direction and
///     wider in another: never the row's own separator, no whitespace, quote or control
///     character (this is spliced into a command line and, on Windows, into a
///     `CreateProcessA` string), and bounded — but bytes at or above `0x80` ARE allowed,
///     because unlike a source name none of them ever becomes a path and a build
///     directory with a non-ASCII component is an ordinary thing to have. This worker's
///     OWN directory is checked too; it is the one value the client did not send, so it
///     is refused as the worker's fault rather than the client's.
///   - **The worker's own rule is DROPPED, not refused, when it would also match the
///     client's directory.** A prefix-map rule appends the unmatched tail, so a worker
///     directory of `/` rewrites `/home/ci/build` to `.home/ci/build` and every system
///     header to `.usr/include/...`. That is the production value — the shipped
///     `pace-node.service` sets no `WorkingDirectory=` and
///     `PosixDaemonHost` calls `chdir("/")` — and measured on gcc 14.2.0 it produced a
///     `DW_AT_comp_dir` of `.tmp/…/client`, a WRONG object under a correct key and
///     strictly worse than the unmapped directory this closes. The client's rule still
///     lands, so the gcc case is fully mapped; what remains is clang on such a node,
///     which is the pre-#506 state rather than a new defect. Refusing instead would
///     cost every dispatched compile on every node installed from the shipped unit.
///   - **A compile directory containing `=`**, this worker's own included. gcc splits
///     `<from>=<to>` at the last separator and clang at the first — measured: a working
///     directory of `/tmp/l506b/eq=sign` mapped to `.` gives `.` under gcc and
///     `sign=.=sign` under clang. A wrong compilation directory is the defect this
///     closes, so the job is refused instead.
///   - **A driver with no such flag.** Read off `PathValueFlags()`'s prefix-map row
///     rather than tested by name, so the spelling, the separator and which families
///     accept it stay in the one table. `cl` has no path-map switch and clang-cl's

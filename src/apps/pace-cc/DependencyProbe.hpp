/// Turning a preprocess probe's output into a cache-key input.
///
/// A cache hit reproduces two artefacts from one key: the object file and the
/// build system's dependency record. Until now the key was a function of only the
/// first. Preprocessing suppresses line markers (`-E -P` / `/EP`, see CmdLine.cpp)
/// so a checkout path never reaches the key — which is what makes a key portable,
/// and equally what makes it **invariant under a header move**. Move a header
/// without changing a byte and the token stream is identical: the object is still
/// correct and is served, while the depfile, which is nothing but paths, names a
/// file that is gone. That is worse than a miss, because the build system records
/// the dependency, cannot stat it, rebuilds, hits the same value, and never
/// converges — with a successful exit code every time (issue #53).
///
/// ReplayGuard detects that at replay time. Folding the dependency set into the
/// key removes the class instead: a moved header is a different key by
/// construction, and existence never has to stand in for identity (issue #56).

/// A preprocess probe's output with the two things it carries separated.
///
/// They arrive interleaved on ONE stream for clang-cl, whose `/showIncludes`
/// notes go to stdout — the same stream the preprocessed text uses. A note line
/// that survived into `preprocessed` would be hashed into the cache key as though
/// it were source, and it names an absolute path, which is exactly what
/// suppressing line markers exists to keep out of a key.

///
/// - A path under either root canonicalizes to a `<SRCROOT>/...` or
///   `<BUILDTREE>/...` token and is kept. These are the project's own headers —
///   the ones that move, and the whole reason this set exists.
/// - A *relative* path is **resolved** against the compile's working directory and
///   then classified exactly like the absolute paths above, rather than kept for its
///   spelling. That is issue #64, and the whole of it is argued below.
/// - A Windows **drive-relative** path (`C:foo`) is emphatically *not* treated as
///   relative, and so is never resolved that way. It resolves against drive C's own
///   current directory — per-process state on the producing machine that no cache
///   entry records — so resolving it against the compile's working directory would
///   name a file that was never read, and hashing its spelling alongside the
///   genuinely relative paths would let two machines whose C: cwd differs produce the
///   *same* key for *different* headers. `PathCanon::Anchor` is what separates the
///   two; before issue #65 the classifier stopped at the colon and called it
///   absolute, reaching a safe outcome by an answer that was not true. It is then
///   left to the root tests rather than dropped outright, because root membership is
///   the stronger question: under no root it cannot prefix-match a rooted root and is
///   dropped as toolchain regardless, while under a drive-relative *root* it
///   canonicalizes to a token that is portable exactly because the consumer
///   substitutes its own root.
/// - **Toolchain content is dropped**, judged by DirectManifest's
///   `ClassifyAgainstRoots` so that this filter, the manifest's and the replay
///   guard's cannot disagree *about an absolute path*: one under neither root,
///   *and* a vcpkg tree nested under the build tree, which canonicalizes but is
///   still the producing machine's. (About a *relative* one the three part, and
///   each answer is deliberate: only this filter resolves before it decides;
///   `ReplayGuard`'s `IsCheckable` keeps every relative path, which is right for an
///   existence probe against this machine's own cwd; and `BuildManifest` refuses
///   the whole manifest rather than dropping the path, because it has no working
///   directory to resolve against and a manifest that silently lost its headers
///   revalidates the source alone. Anything moved into a shared helper has to
///   account for all three.) It is covered collectively by the compiler identity
///   already in the key, and hashing it would mean two machines with the same
///   compiler but
///   different install prefixes (`/usr/include/c++/16` against
///   `/opt/gcc-16/include`) share *nothing at all* — a full duplicate entry set
///   for every translation unit. This is the same split DirectManifest makes for
///   the same reason (see its header: 476 of a real TU's 635 headers are
///   toolchain, and "a manifest naming them would be machine-specific").
///
/// **A relative path is classified by what it resolves to, never by its
/// spelling** (issue #64), which is why this needs a working directory at all.
/// Both rules above ask what a path *names*; "is it absolute" answers a different
/// question, and the two invert for a vendored or relocatable toolchain reached
/// through a relative include path. `-I../../vendor/sdk/include` — the ordinary
/// way a vendored SDK is referenced from a build directory — makes the driver
/// report `../../vendor/sdk/include/foo.h`, which lies under no root, so a
/// spelling test *keeps and hashes* it ahead of the toolchain rule that drops the
/// very same file when the driver spells it absolutely. Two machines whose build
/// directory sits at a different depth then key every translation unit that
/// touches that SDK differently — the "same compiler, share nothing at all"
/// outcome the toolchain exclusion exists to prevent, arrived at from the other
/// side. Resolving first makes both branches one branch: a relative project
/// header becomes the same token its absolute spelling would, and a relative
/// toolchain header is dropped exactly as an absolute one is.
///
/// What that gives up is what ReplayGuard still covers: the key no longer
/// re-keys when a *vendored* header moves, but a hit's replayed dependency record
/// is probed for existence before it is written, so the moved path discards the
/// hit rather than being replayed. That is the same trade, and the same backstop,
/// the absolute toolchain exclusion has always made.
///
/// The result is sorted and deduplicated. `/showIncludes` repeats a header once
/// per inclusion site — hundreds of notes for a few dozen files — and sorting
/// makes the key insensitive to emission-order differences between driver
/// versions, which are not differences in what was compiled.
///
/// Pure: touches no filesystem. The resolution is lexical for that reason and for

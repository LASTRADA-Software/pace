# End-to-end validation of the pace-cc launcher with REAL compilations.
#
# Proves the launcher behaves as a drop-in sccache replacement:
#   1. First compile of a file is a MISS (real compiler runs, result stored).
#   2. Second compile of the same content is a HIT (served from cache, correct
#      object produced) — even after the object is deleted.
#   3. A result past PACE_MAX_STORE_BYTES is skipped, and the compile still
#      succeeds — a compiler cache must never be able to fail a build. On POSIX
#      the launcher used to stream such an object at a daemon that refuses an
#      over-cap frame and closes, then die of SIGPIPE mid-store with the object
#      already correct on disk (issue #68).
#   4. Cross-depth: content compiled/stored with a DEEP srcroot is a HIT when
#      compiled from a SHALLOW srcroot (different checkout), with showIncludes
#      localized so the deps resolve.
#   5. An EDITED source is a MISS, and yields a different object. The preprocessed
#      text is the only key input carrying the source's content, so a probe that
#      captures none of it answers an edit with the previous revision's object — a
#      wrong build, silently, every time. Checked with direct mode off, because the
#      manifest hashes the source's own bytes and would otherwise mask it. This is
#      the property `/EP` plus `/P` broke: the pair writes the preprocessed text to
#      a FILE, leaving the launcher hashing an empty stdout.
#   6. Moved header: a header that moves with its contents unchanged is a MISS by
#      construction, and the entry stored before the move is still there when it
#      comes back. Preprocessing suppresses line markers, so the token stream and
#      the object are identical after such a move and only the paths differ; the
#      dependency set is part of the key so that the two layouts are two keys
#      rather than one key a replay guard has to catch (issues #53 and #56).
#      Also checked with direct mode off, because the manifest keys on the
#      source's own bytes and would answer the move-back on its own.
#   7. Root-bound objects: a translation unit that bakes its own path into
#      program data -- `__FILE__`, or the builtin `std::source_location` is made
#      of -- is NOT served into a second checkout, in either direct mode, while
#      one that bakes none still is; the first checkout still hits its own copy;
#      and a hit `PACE_VERIFY` rejects is logged `VERIFY-MISMATCH`, never
#      `HIT`. No key can see those paths -- the direct-mode key never sees the
#      `__FILE__` expansion and `source_location` reaches no key at all -- so
#      the launcher reads the object (apps/pace-cc/RootBinding.hpp).
#   9. Roots that do not identify the checkout: a RELATIVE export (`.` and `build`),
#      roots NARROWER than the tree a relative `cl /FC` compile reaches, and roots both
#      checkouts SHARE (one absolute pair exported by both). The second checkout must
#      never be served an object naming the first -- the bound key folds the checkout
#      ABSOLUTE and resolved, and the working directory is scanned and keyed too.
#  10. An 8.3 alias of the build tree: `-I` spelled with every component short while
#      the build tree is exported long. The second build directory must never be
#      served an object naming the first's short path -- the scan reads every alias
#      the key's reconciliation mapped onto a root.
#  11. A junction alias of the build tree, flat, NESTED (a second junction inside the
#      build tree), THROUGH it into the source root, and through a SUBDIRECTORY of it
#      into the source root: the key maps it onto a root, so
#      the scan must know the junction spelling -- every root it names, recorded as the
#      key maps it, walking up the whole spelling.
#  12. A save DURING a compile records nothing unsound (#1650): through
#      `mid-compile-edit-stub`, which forwards to the real driver and overwrites a file
#      in place once the compile has exited, the raced compile stores nothing and is
#      logged INPUTS-MOVED, and the saved content -- the TU's or a header's -- is a MISS
#      that builds what was saved and stores it, here and in another checkout; the raced
#      manifest names the KEYED content, so an object another checkout stores under that
#      key is never served to the saved content. With no save, the same
#      stub still stores, direct-hits, and shares across checkouts.
#   8. Replayed diagnostics: two checkouts sharing a key LEGITIMATELY (nothing in
#      the preprocessed text names a path, direct mode off) -- the second HITs,
#      and every warning and `note:` it replays names the SECOND checkout, with
#      no trace of the first anywhere in either stream. The MSVC family's streams
#      were tagged with a grammar that rewrites /showIncludes notes only, so each
#      diagnostic used to replay the producer's path (value generation 6).
#
# The POSIX counterpart (scripts/compile-cache-e2e.sh) additionally asserts that
# a hit restores the GNU depfile, localized to the consuming checkout. That has
# no analogue here: the MSVC drivers report dependencies inline via
# /showIncludes (asserted above) and set usesDepfile = false, so -MF is never
# parsed and no depfile region is ever stored for them.
#
# Output is generic status only; nothing project-private is read or emitted,
# nothing is committed.
#
# ## The port (#220)
#
# DRAWN per run, from 20000..32000, like every sibling fixture. It used to be the
# constant 21714, and nothing reaped the daemon when a run did not reach its
# cleanup -- so a ctest interrupted, timed out or cancelled left `pace-kv.exe`
# listening for as long as the machine was up, and every later run failed at
# `pace-kv exited immediately (exit 1)`, naming neither the port nor the
# process.
#
# The reason offered for the constant was real and did not support it: the launcher
# under test reads `PACE_ADDR` from the environment and several child
# processes inherit it, so the port must be decided BEFORE the daemon starts. That
# is an argument for deciding it early, which drawing does.
#
# Its siblings were checked rather than assumed: `scripts/compile-cache-e2e.sh`
# (the POSIX half of this same test), `scripts/dist-compile-e2e.sh` and
# `scripts/sccache-smoke.sh` all call `free_port`, with `PACE_SMOKE_PORT` in
# `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` defaulting to EMPTY so the registration passes no
# `--port`.
#
# An explicitly passed `-Port` is honoured and PROBED first, and a holder is
# refused by name rather than adopted -- a leftover listener is of an unknown
# vintage and may hold a store from a different build, which is the class of
# confusion this fixture exists to detect rather than reproduce. The one exception
# is a listener whose image path is byte-for-byte the daemon this run would start:
# that is reaped, which is not adoption but the manual `Stop-Process` somebody
# already does.
#
# **None of that lives here any more.** It was correct and private, which is how
# two sibling fixtures went on binding a constant with nothing to reach: the draw,
# the probe and the decision are `scripts/lib/E2EPorts.psm1` now, and this file is
# one of its three consumers (#1284).

# Scratch trees live beside the build tree, not under %TEMP%.
#
# On a GitHub Windows runner %TEMP% is `C:\Users\RUNNER~1\...` — an 8.3 short
# name — and the two drivers disagree about it: `cl` resolves an include through
# the filesystem and reports the LONG name, while clang-cl echoes the spelling it
# was handed. Every root test in the launcher is a string prefix comparison, so a
# short-spelled root matches nothing `cl` emits: PathCanon classifies all of its
# headers as outside both roots, which empties the keyed dependency set AND makes
# the replay guard skip the very paths it exists to check. A moved header then
# keys identically and nothing reports it (measured: "dependency set: 0 of 1
# reported path(s) keyed"). That was a launcher limitation — issue #66, since
# fixed by resolving both the roots and every emitted path through the filesystem
# — and it is still not what these cases are here to measure.
#
# So the roots stay unambiguous here even though the launcher now reconciles them:
# every case above would otherwise be testing the reconciliation as well as its own
# property, and a regression in either would present as a failure of the other. The
# reconciliation has a case of its own instead ("aliased source root"), which
# creates the second spelling deliberately with `subst`.
#
# The build tree is used rather than an expanded short name because there is no
# dependable way to expand one: Resolve-Path, Get-Item and [IO.Path]::GetFullPath
# all preserve it, and Scripting.FileSystemObject was tried and echoed it back
# unchanged. That is also why the aliased-root case substitutes a drive rather than
# asking for an 8.3 name it cannot be sure exists.

# Start-Process resolves a relative -FilePath against the PROCESS working
# directory, not PowerShell's, so a caller passing "out/build/..." would get a
# spurious "file not found". Resolve both up front.
# Guarded for the same reason the skips above are: `-SelfTestPorts` drives the
# port helpers and touches neither binary, and `Resolve-Path` is a hard error for
# a path that does not exist. Everything below this is pure string work, so it is

# --- dead peers ---------------------------------------------------------------
# A cache is an accelerator, so a cache that cannot answer must never end the compile. Every
# other case here talks to a live daemon, which is why making a failed fetch end the
# invocation went unnoticed by all of them. These legs point the launcher at a peer that
# cannot answer in each of the three ways a dead cache can be silent, and the object must
# still be built -- inside a bound, so a hang on one of them is a named failure rather than
# the test's own timeout.

# The launcher's two cache deadlines, set for the dead-peer legs alone. Short so a leg costs
# seconds, and the bound is derived from them, so shortening them tightens it.
$DeadPeerConnectMs = 1000
$DeadPeerTotalMs   = 2000

# How many cache exchanges one compile can spend on a dead peer before it compiles: direct
# mode's manifest round trip, then the object fetch. Never the STORE, which a fetch the cache
# did not serve skips. `pace-cc --help` says the same under PACE_TIMEOUT.
$DeadPeerExchanges = 2

# What ONE exchange can cost against each dead shape -- the deadline that ends it -- from which the
# leg's HANG bound is composed. A table, because the shapes spend different deadlines:
#   never-accepting    the connect completes into the backlog, so the exchange runs out TOTAL
#   refused            the dial fails: at once on Linux, after SYN retries on Windows, never past CONNECT
#   accept-then-reset  the RST arrives at once; at most CONNECT
#
# HOW MANY exchanges a leg spent is COUNTED, never inferred from time. Every cache exchange the
# launcher makes goes through one door that says so on its verbose trace (`cache exchange (...)`),
# and each leg asks for exactly $DeadPeerExchanges such lines. The two shapes whose peer can count
# too -- the reset accepts every connection, and never-accepting's listener keeps every one in its
# backlog (measured on Windows: a connection closed or reset before it is accepted is still
# accepted afterwards) -- must agree with the trace, which is what makes the launcher's own count
# trustworthy on the one shape whose peer cannot count: refused.
#
# Time judged the count twice, and both times it measured the HOST rather than the launcher. On the
# wall clock (round 8) the compile and the process starts rode along; on the launcher's own
# `direct-ms` + `cache-ms` (round 9) a refused leg on a starved runner spent 3616 ms against two
# 1000 ms dials, with that compiler's live baseline at 3242 ms and the next one's at 150. Measured
# here: a launcher FROZEN for 1.5 s inside a refused dial reports ~2810 ms for its two exchanges --
# a deadline cannot fire while the process does not run -- and its trace still counts two. 128
# busy processes on 32 cores moved neither number. The count is the same however slow the machine
# is; no slack on a time is.
#
# Time is still judged where it cannot be fooled by a slow host. A shape whose exchange cannot end
# before a deadline has a FLOOR: N x that deadline, less a timer's resolution. A peer that never
# answers ends each exchange only at TOTAL, and load can only lengthen it -- so a launcher whose
# `cache-ms` reads 0, or is taken at the wrong point, fails it. Refused has no floor although
# Windows runs a refused dial out to CONNECT: that is Windows' SYN-retry behaviour, not this
# launcher's. The reset's exchanges end at once. That shape has a CEILING too, (2N - 1/2) x TOTAL,
# 7000 ms at N = 2 and TOTAL = 2000. An exchange that DOUBLED its deadline reports 2N x TOTAL =
# 8000 (measured 8006-8017) and fails it by TOTAL / 2 = 1000 ms; one that IGNORED PACE_TIMEOUT
# falls back to the default total of 10000 ms per exchange and reports about 20000. Neither a
# counted retry nor a default substitution has the 1.5x shape this lets through. And the wall
# clock bounds the whole leg as the HANG detector: N x cost + cost / 2, plus the baseline, plus
# $DeadPeerWallSlackMs.
#
# The ceiling is NOT raised to forgive a stalled host: a loaded Windows runner reported 7602 and
# then 8132 ms, and 8132 is past the 8000 a doubled deadline reports, so time alone cannot tell a
# starved host from a doubled TOTAL (#1739). A STARVATION WITNESS decides instead
# (`scripts/lib/E2EStarvationWitness.psm1`, the twin of `compile-cache-e2e.sh`'s): a thread of
# this process asks for a 20 ms sleep over and over on a Stopwatch, and sums how far each wake-up
# was late by more than a STALL threshold of 50 ms. Never the raw lateness: that is the TIMER's
# granularity, 2924-3221 ms over 8 s of an idle host under pwsh, which would excuse a doubled
# deadline outright; the stalled figure there is 0 (the module holds the measurement). The witness
# stops once the launcher says its last exchange failed, so its window is the CACHE phase and not
# the compile after it. A reading over the ceiling is then one of three outcomes, decided by the
# pure `Get-E2EDeadCeilingVerdict`: PASS (within it), INCONCLUSIVE (the host stalled at least as
# long as the overrun, so the overrun is not the launcher's to answer for -- printed, annotated
# on CI, repeated before the run's last line, never failed) or FAIL (the host did not stall that
# long, or the witness left no reading: no evidence of starvation fails CLOSED). Under `ctest` a
# PASSING test's output is not shown -- every preset sets only `outputOnFailure` -- so the
# annotation reaches GitHub only from the job that runs this script directly.
#
# The witness fails OPEN where a host starves the ticker and not the launcher, and where its window
# is wider than the time judged -- it opens before the launcher's process does and spans the
# launcher's own work between its two exchanges, so a stall there excuses an overrun it did not
# cause. It fails CLOSED where a host starves in slices under the threshold, which count nothing,
# and where a host starves only the launcher, the right way round.
#
# BLIND SPOTS, failing OPEN. A retry INSIDE one exchange -- below the door, in the dial -- is one
# trace line: the counted shapes see it as an extra connection, refused does not see it at all.
# And a WAIT anywhere -- a back-off, a wait before the direct attempt or the compile, a store after
# a failed fetch -- is judged only by the hang bound, while an exchange it makes is a trace line
# and counted. And whether CONNECT is honoured end to end is judged by no leg: refused and the
# reset carry no ceiling, because a stall moves a refused dial past any one tight enough to see a
# doubled CONNECT (round 9: +1616 ms); the deadline MECHANICS are ReactorExchange_test's, and only
# the environment-to-budget wiring of CONNECT is left to the hang bound.

/// Whether a cached compile's *dependency record* is still true on this machine.
///
/// A cache hit reproduces two artefacts from one key: the object file and the
/// build system's dependency record (a GNU depfile, or the `/showIncludes` notes
/// Ninja parses as `deps = msvc`). The key determines only the first. Preprocessing
/// suppresses line markers (`-E -P` / `/EP`, see CmdLine.cpp) precisely so that a
/// checkout path never reaches the key — which is what makes a key portable, and
/// also what makes it **invariant under a header move**. The object is a function of
/// the token stream and is still correct after such a move; the depfile is nothing
/// but paths and is not.
///
/// Replaying a dependency record that names a file this machine does not have is
/// worse than a miss: the build system records the dependency, cannot stat it, marks
/// the target dirty, rebuilds, hits the same cached value, and never converges — with
/// a successful exit code every time (issue #53). So a hit re-checks the paths it is
/// about to assert, exactly as ValidateManifest re-checks a direct-mode manifest
/// before trusting it, and a hit that cannot be honoured here is discarded rather
/// than served.

/// The paths a replayed hit asserts this machine has: first-seen order, deduplicated,
/// filtered to the ones this build is actually responsible for.
///
/// **Which paths are checked, and why each exclusion is load-bearing.** Every one of
/// these was a way to turn a perfectly good hit into a miss:
///
/// - The rule target of a depfile is not a dependency — and it is the *object file*,
///   which does not exist yet because the caller is about to write it. Probing it
///   would make every single hit a miss. ParseDepFilePaths already excludes it (and
///   `-MP` phony rules), which is why it is reused here rather than a whitespace
///   split written.
/// - A path that still carries a canonical sentinel (`<SRCROOT>/...`) is one the
///   region walker declined to localize — the extractors accept slightly more than
///   PathCanon's grammars do — so it names nothing on any machine and is skipped.
/// - An absolute path outside both roots is toolchain or system content, covered
///   collectively by the toolchain stamp. Checking it would break *convergence*, not
///   merely hit rate: machine A stores `/usr/include/c++/15/...`, machine B probes it,
///   misses, and re-stores `/opt/gcc/...`, whereupon A misses too — two machines
///   missing on every compile, forever.
/// - A *relative* path is kept. It resolves against the compile's working directory,
///   which is also the launcher's, so it is always this machine's path. Note this must
///   be decided before the toolchain test, which reports every relative path as
///   outside the roots.
/// - A Windows **drive-relative** path (`C:foo`) is skipped — not because it is
///   someone else's content, but because the probe cannot be made truthfully. It
///   resolves against drive C's own current directory, and `std::filesystem::operator/`
///   reaches neither that nor anything equivalent: on a POSIX host `wd / "C:foo"` is a
///   name that exists nowhere, which would discard every hit carrying such a path
///   forever, and on Windows it either replaces the left operand or appends against the
///   *process* cwd. So it falls under the rule below rather than the ones above: a path
///   that cannot be examined counts as present. `PathCanon::Anchor` is what separates it
///   from a relative path (issue #65).
///
///   What that skip used to leave is closed upstream rather than here. Under no root
///   such a path is dropped from the KEY as well, so a header moved inside it was
///   neither re-keyed nor probed; `Cc::IsDriveRelativeUnderNoRoot` refuses to cache
///   such a compile at all (issue #104), so no entry written since carries one.
///   Entries written BEFORE it were a residual in their own right, and closing that is
///   what `manifest-v5` is for (issue #111): the authoritative refusal runs after
///   `TryDirectMode`, and the earlier command-line one can only see a path an argument
///   carries, so a pre-fix manifest for a TU whose drive-relative header arrived some
///   other way — an `#include "C:foo/x.h"` written out in the source, a fused flag
///   spelling `PathValueFlags()` does not know — stayed direct-hittable under a key
///   that had not moved. Re-keying is what retired those; see `ComputeManifestKey`.
///   This arm is why such a hit was not discarded instead: the probe would have no
///   truthful answer to give.
///
///   Under a drive-relative *root* the path is keyed, which is what covers it there.
///
/// Pure: touches no filesystem.

/// The arguments no worker passes to a compiler, whatever its operator allows -- read by BOTH ends.
///
/// **Header-only, beside `CmdLine.hpp`, for the reason `CompileCacheWire.hpp` is header-only**:
/// the launcher does not link `Pace`, and a table two processes must agree on is one table.
/// The worker consults it inside `IsAcceptableJobArgument`, above its allowlist and above the
/// operator's `--allow-compile-arg`, so no configuration re-admits a row. The LAUNCHER consults it
/// in `Dispatch` before it asks for a lease: an argument every worker refuses by row is one no
/// lease can buy, and asking cost a lease, a round trip and the whole preprocessed translation
/// unit on the wire for a refusal known in advance. The worker still enforces it, because the two
/// ends can be different builds and because the launcher is not the only thing that can reach a
/// worker's port.
///
/// **A refusal by ROW, never by absence.** Absence from the allowlist and a row here were the same
/// answer only while nothing else was consulted; `--allow-compile-arg` (#293) is consulted, and it
/// may extend the allowlist to a flag this build has not heard of -- never to one of these. That is
/// what makes "operator entries EXTEND, never replace" a property of the code rather than a comment.
///
/// **Every row is a PREFIX of the argument with one introducer stripped, and whatever follows is
/// not examined.** A refusal must not be escapable by the shape rule that narrows an allowance:
/// `-fplugin=x` carries no separator and `-fplugin=/tmp/x.so` does, so a shape-checked row would
/// refuse the harmless-looking spelling and pass the one that names a payload.

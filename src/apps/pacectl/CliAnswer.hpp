///   - `Negative` against `Unreachable` -- a cache miss and a dead daemon. A script

///   - `Refused` against `Protocol` -- the server said no, versus the server said
///     something this client could not read. Different people fix those.
///   - `Usage` against everything -- the operator's mistake, not the system's.
///   - `Local` against `Refused` -- this machine could not do it, versus the server
///     declined. One remedy is here (redirect the output, use another terminal) and the

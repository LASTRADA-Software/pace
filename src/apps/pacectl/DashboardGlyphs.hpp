/// (`DashboardRung.hpp`), looks its row up once, and draws through the row: the sparkline, the

/// places for the rungs to come to disagree about what a gap looks like.
///
/// **What is NOT in the table is as deliberate as what is.** The absent marker has no column:
/// it is the operator's `--absent`, resolved once by whoever composes the session, and it is the
/// same text on every rung (#134 §9.6). A column for it would be the one way to let two rungs
/// render one absent cell differently.

/// The eight block elements a Unicode sparkline draws, lowest first.
///

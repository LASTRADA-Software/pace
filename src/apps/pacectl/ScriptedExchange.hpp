/// A programmed `IExchange`, shared by every verb test.
///
/// One helper rather than a fake per test file, for the reason the tree records about
/// `ScriptedSocket.hpp`: three private copies of one scripted socket carried the same
/// defect in two of them, found a day apart, because **a fake nothing exercises does
/// not report its own bugs**.
///
/// It is deliberately no more permissive than the thing it stands for. It records what
/// was sent so a test can assert the *request*, and it runs out of answers rather than
/// repeating the last one -- a fake that answers forever makes an extra round trip
/// invisible.

/// The frame a case expects a scripted exchange to have sent, REQUIRED to exist.
///
/// **Every read of a frame one of these exchanges recorded goes through this, never through
/// `Sent().front()` or `Sent()[i]`.** A case asserting a reply with `CHECK` and then reading
/// the frame the subject sent carries on past a failed check -- and a subject that refused
/// sends nothing, so the read is past the end of an empty vector: undefined behaviour rather
/// than a red. Measured on #1402: a neuter that refused one store killed the CLI suite with
/// SIGSEGV, and 296 of its 623 cases never ran (#1457). Here the `REQUIRE` fails before any
/// element is read, naming the frame it expected and how many were sent, and the binary goes on.
/// Called inside a `CHECK` -- the usual spelling, `CHECK(SentFrame(x) == ...)` -- the thrown
/// failure is reported a second time as that check's unexpected exception and the case carries
/// on past it; that is noise, never a read past the end.
///
/// A template over the three scripted exchanges, whose `Sent()` hold RESP arguments, memcached
/// text and `0xFC` frames respectively. It asserts only that the frame EXISTS; a case that
/// means "exactly one was sent" says so with its own `REQUIRE` on the size.

/// case cannot say *a resize arrived between the fetch and the frame* without racing
/// something; with one ordered list it is an input, and every ordering that has ever
/// broken a dashboard becomes a case somebody can write down. That is `FleetHarness`'s

/// The property this buys, which is what makes *100% mockable* checkable rather than
/// aspirational: **the same event list renders byte-identical frames, every run.** One

/// terminal or a socket that is not in the list.

/// well-formed samples on a tidy cadence tests a world that does not exist, and nothing
/// about it looks wrong -- which is the *fake more permissive than the thing it stands
/// for* rule. So a failed read, a departed source and a keystroke that lands mid-fetch
/// are events with names rather than states a test has to contrive.

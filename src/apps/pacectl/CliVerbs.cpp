    // no new flag, no new address and no new transport. The working client that existed
    // before them lives inside `pace-node`, which is the problem: the
    // natural way to run cluster admin on machines 2..40 is from the machine being
    // provisioned, and `RunClusterAdmin` needs `--scheduler`, which is ALSO a startup
    // flag -- so getting it into the unit file once points that node at one scheduler
    // forever, because a registration replays its command line. A client machine (a
    // laptop, a CI runner) has no node binary at all and could never ask.
    //
    // **Lifted, not duplicated, and the lift is smaller than it looks.** The encoders
    // are already `CompileCacheWire`'s and the decoder is already `Cluster::`, both of
    // them the single source of truth; the only rule that had two authors was reading a

    // so every node verb gets one spelling. `RenderClusterState` is deliberately NOT
    // lifted: it is a fixed plain-text report for a person, and this tool's entire

/// @file TerminalEvents.hpp
/// The production producer of the dashboard's TERMINAL events: keystrokes, geometry and the
/// terminal going away. And, beside them, what the terminal can draw.
///
/// **This header names nothing from core-cpp**, and that is the design rather than a tidiness
/// preference. The core-cpp types this is built on live in `TerminalEvents.cpp` and
/// `TerminalEventStream.*`, which makes those the only place the two projects meet.
///
/// **Two types, so "start before reading" is the only thing that compiles.** A terminal event
/// source has to acquire the terminal (raw mode, then the queries the rung is decided from)
/// before it can produce anything, and it must not acquire it earlier than asked: a run that
/// never draws may compose one and never start it. With one interface and a `Start()` beside
/// `Next()`, reading first and starting twice both compile and only a comment says not to. Here
/// the unstarted value has nothing to call, `StartTerminal` consumes it, and the event source
/// exists only in what a successful start returns.
///
/// **The events suspend on READINESS, never on a timer.** Each wait is a core-cpp
/// `core::net::IoBackend` watching the terminal's handles: epoll, kqueue or poll on POSIX, the
/// completion port on Windows. That wait BLOCKS, so it runs on the pool and the result is handed back: the same two-hop
/// `TakeFrame` uses, for the same reason. On the reactor it would stall ticks, samples and quit
/// together.

/// A terminal that has not been acquired yet. It has nothing to call; `StartTerminal` consumes it.
///
/// Holding one touches no terminal: no raw mode, no protocol change, no query. Destroying one that
/// was never started leaves the terminal exactly as it was.

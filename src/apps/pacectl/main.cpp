    //    residue is #1578. The token never goes to the admin surface at all (`HttpGet`).

    //    `pacectl` spawns no process, and `Call` hands the vector to
    //    `EncodeCommand` and a socket write. It is recorded because the name says
    //    "process argument vector" everywhere else in this tree -- `main`'s own `argv`
    //    is three hundred lines below -- and it has already been misread that way once,
    //    which would have made a heap-residue follow-up read as a disclosure.

    //    is header-only because the launcher does not link `Pace`, and
    //    `SecureBytes.hpp` needs `SecureBytes.cpp` for `SecureZero`, so naming it there
    //    would put a link requirement on every consumer of the wire grammar. An explicit

/// Turning pixels into Sixel data: the Sixel rung's one door to core-cpp's terminal UI.
///
/// **One function behind an interface, and core-cpp's encoder behind exactly one file.** The
/// dashboard draws a chart as RGBA pixels and hands them here; `TuiSixelEncoder.cpp` is the only
/// file of this binary that includes `<core/tui/Sixel.hpp>`, so core-cpp's vocabulary meets the
/// first-party one in one place (widen the adapter, never add a crossing). A
/// test substitutes `Testing::ScriptedSixelEncoder` and needs no TUI at all.
///
/// **The same image encodes to the same bytes on every standard library.** Core-cpp's median-cut
/// quantizer orders a bucket's pixels by the whole colour, its widest channel first, so no split
/// follows the order a sort happened to leave equal keys in. It once sorted on the widest channel
/// alone, unstably, and libstdc++, libc++ and MSVC's library each encoded one image to different
/// bytes. So one event list renders one Sixel frame everywhere, and `SixelEncoder_test.cpp` pins an
/// encoding's digest at this seam -- the image and the digest core-cpp's `core/tui/Sixel_test.cpp`
/// pins below it.

/// RGBA pixels, row-major, four bytes per pixel, borrowed for the call.

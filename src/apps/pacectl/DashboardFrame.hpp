/// A frame as a view hands it to a sink: its text, and the images placed over it.

/// **Its own header, dependency-free,** because it is the contract between three halves that build
/// apart: the panels, which decide WHERE an image goes and what it shows; the loop, which carries a
/// frame from one to the other; and the terminal presenter, which is the only code that spells an
/// escape sequence. None of them may see another's machinery through this.

/// How many pixels one terminal cell measures, as the terminal reported it.
///
/// **Reported, never guessed** (#134 decision on Sixel): a cell size nobody measured is the one
/// input that makes an image the wrong size while every figure beside it is right. So it travels as
/// an `optional` everywhere it travels, and the Sixel rung is not chosen without one.

    std::size_t height { 0 }; ///< Pixels down one cell.

/// One image a frame places over its text.
///
/// **A rectangle of CELLS, and the image's own bytes.** The view lays the frame out in cells and
/// leaves this rectangle blank in its text; the presenter writes the text rows as it always does and
/// then, for each placement, positions the cursor at `row`, `column` and writes the image -- inside
/// the same synchronized-output bracket as the text, so the terminal shows the two together.

/// selected one or that an age is stale, and the presenter -- the only code that spells a sequence --
/// looks up how that looks in `TonePalette`, the one palette every panel is drawn with. A terminal
/// whose capability record allows no colour gets none of it: the grid is the same text either way.

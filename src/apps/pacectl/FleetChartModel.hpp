/// chart layout -- pixels on the Sixel rung, the rung's chart marks below it. Pure: points in, tracks and pixels
/// out, so every rule below is a case over literals, and the encoder that turns pixels into Sixel stays behind
/// `ISixelEncoder`.

/// One per-machine figure the fleet chart can draw.
///
/// **A row, so a second figure is a row rather than a branch.** Its columns are named here because
/// the chart needs one figure per machine and the document carries dozens: a test requires both
/// columns to be ones the leader's own renderer writes (`FleetColumnNames`), so a column renamed there
/// fails here instead of drawing an empty chart.
///
/// **No scale column**: the raw cell is scaled by the value column's own `Distributed::CellFormat`, looked up in
/// the leader's tables (`FleetColumnFormat`), so `cpu-busy` is in thousandths because the leader says so and not
/// because this row restates it.

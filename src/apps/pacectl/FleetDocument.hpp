/// Reading `/fleet.txt`: one section, or the whole document -- the ONE parser this client has.
///
/// **One parser for every reader of the leader's text.** The `fleet` verb reads one section,
/// a `live-stats fleet` session reads the whole document per sample, and a panel draws from
/// what that session read. Two copies of the grammar would be two places for a column the
/// leader renders to go missing, which is the defect #1320 records one repository over.
///
/// **A header of its own rather than a row of `CliVerbs.hpp`**, because reading the markers
/// needs `FleetSectionTable`, and that table's header carries the scheduler's and the
/// cluster's vocabulary: every translation unit including the verb table would compile it for
/// the three that read a fleet document.

/// One `/fleet.txt` section, as a table.
///
/// The header line names the columns and every later line is a row, which is the
/// whole grammar -- there is no column list here, and there must not be: the
/// leader decided them from `FleetColumn`, and a second list in this binary would
/// be a place for the two to disagree.
///
/// A cell of `-` becomes the real `Absent`, so `--absent` and the JSON `null`
/// behave as they do for every other verb rather than a dash being text that
/// happens to look absent. Everything else stays TEXT, escaping included: this
/// client has no model of which columns are numbers, and inventing one would be a
/// second description of the same columns.

/// seventh section must not fail every sample an older client takes, when the six it knows are
/// all there.
///
/// Outside a section, a `#` line that is not a marker is a comment: the notes a follower

///   - a line that is neither a comment nor inside a section, before the first marker;
///   - the same section twice, which leaves no way to say which one is the fleet;

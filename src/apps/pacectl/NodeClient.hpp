/// The client half of the `0xFC` compile-cache wire, for the operator verbs.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// `pace-node` speaks `0xFC` and **nothing else**. Measured against the
/// running node on this machine: RESP `PING`, RESP `INFO` and memcached `version` each
/// closed the connection having sent nothing at all, while a `0xFC` header got a proper
/// refusal. So `pacectl version` reported *the server closed the connection
/// without answering* -- a true sentence and a useless one, because it describes what
/// happened and not what to do.
///
/// ## The THREE refusal states, which is the whole of the design
///
/// A client that reads a refusal as a binary -- worked, did not work -- gets exactly
/// the failure this tree has already paid for twice (#283, #340): a `PACE_TOKEN`
/// launcher took `DispatchNotPermitted` for *not implemented*, stepped over it, and
/// earned a permanent 0% hit rate that presented as a cold cache. Correct objects,
/// green build, no counter moving.
///
///   - **`UnimplementedVerb`** (`0x02`) -- *this endpoint does not implement that*. The
///     verb may be perfectly implementable and this build simply has no component for
///     it. A client STEPS OVER it: the operator is told which endpoint lacks which verb
///     and the exit code says *refused*, never *unreachable*.
///   - **`DispatchNotPermitted`** (`0x0C`) -- *that job is done somewhere else*. A
///     routing fact, so the remedy is a different address rather than a different
///     build. Fatal, and it must never be reported as *your node is too old*.
///   - **Everything else** -- an ordinary refusal, relayed BY NAME with whatever the
///     server said. `NotAMember` is the one an operator meets in practice, and its
///     remedy (admitting this machine's key) is on the node rather than here.
///
/// The distinction is a TABLE column below, not a `switch` at a call site, for the
/// reason the rulebook gives: three surfaces spelling one refusal separately is exactly
/// how they came to disagree.

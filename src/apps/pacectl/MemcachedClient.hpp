/// @file MemcachedClient.hpp
/// The memcached **text** protocol, client side: an encoder and a reply parser.
///
/// ## Why this exists at all, when RESP already works
///
/// The two surfaces are not supersets of one another. `touch`, `gat`/`gats`, `append`,
/// `prepend`, `cas`, `add`, `replace`, the `stats` sub-commands, `cache_memlimit` and
/// the meta `me` inspector exist ONLY here -- and `me` is the only way anything reaches
/// a key's last-access time, its cas token and its stored size, which is the most
/// useful per-key diagnostic this daemon has.
///
/// ## Why it is harder than RESP, stated so nobody re-litigates it
///
/// A RESP reply is type-prefixed, so ONE parser reads every command including ones
/// added later. A memcached reply is ad hoc per command family, and the only thing
/// they share is that the FIRST TOKEN says what the rest of the reply is. That token
/// is what this parser dispatches on (`McLeadToken`), which is as close to
/// type-prefixed as this wire gets: a new command whose reply opens with a token
/// already in the table needs no parser change.
///
/// ## The constraint that shapes every caller
///
/// **There is no AUTH verb on this protocol.** `MemcachedText.cpp` replies
/// `CLIENT_ERROR authentication required` and then ENDS THE SESSION for every verb but
/// `version` and `quit` when `--requirepass` is set -- deliberately, because a refused
/// storage command still has its data block sitting unread and continuing would parse
/// those bytes as the next command. So these verbs are unavailable against a
/// password-protected daemon, and a client must refuse them BY NAME rather than dial
/// and hang. `WireSpec::credentialRefusal` in `CliVerbs.hpp` is where that is said.

/// The first token of a reply, which says what the rest of it is.
///
/// A private enum: nothing persists or transmits its ordinals. The WORDS are the wire
/// contract and they are spelled as literals in `LeadTokenTable`.

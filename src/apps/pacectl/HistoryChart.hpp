/// @file HistoryChart.hpp
/// A chart of history, as data: bands of shares across time, and what they become as pixels or as text cells.
///
/// **The one chart renderer every panel draws with** (#134 F14). A band is a row of the chart: a machine of the
/// fleet, or a figure of a node or a cache. Each band holds its readings' SHARES of the band's top, oldest first,
/// so the renderer knows nothing of what a band stands for, and the fleet and the other panels cannot come to
/// draw a reading, a zero or a gap differently.
///
/// What every chart keeps, whatever draws it:
///   - **a reading is a bar rising from the band's floor**, as tall as its share of the band's top;
///   - **zero is distinct from nothing read**: a zero is the track (pixels) or the lowest mark (text), a
///     sample that did not read the figure is blank;
///   - **the newest sample is at the right edge**, and a sample keeps its width, so a young history fills from the
///     right rather than stretching.
///
/// Pure: shares in, pixels or text out. The encoder that turns pixels into Sixel stays behind `ISixelEncoder`.

/// How a band's bars are coloured on a pixel chart. Private to a process: transmitted and persisted nowhere.
///
/// **A colour is a claim**, so a band makes one only where its figure has one to make. The ramp runs cold to hot,
/// and hot reads as trouble: right for a machine's CPU or a cache's fill against its limit, and wrong for a rate
/// scaled to its own peak, which would draw ordinary load as an alarm. Such a band's height already says its share.

/// parses requests and writes replies; nothing anywhere reads a reply. The existing
/// tests compare whole literal reply strings by hand, so there was nothing to lift.
///
/// The parser is a pure function over bytes with an explicit *incomplete* answer,
/// rather than a coroutine over an `core::net::ISocket`. That is what lets every reply
/// shape -- including the malformed and truncated ones, which are the interesting
/// half and the ones a real server will not produce on demand -- be tested against
/// a byte string with no socket and no daemon.

/// A RESP reply's type.
///
/// A private enum: nothing here persists or transmits an ordinal of it. The *bytes*
/// are the contract and they live in `TypeMarker` below.
///
/// RESP3 types are parsed even though this client does not send `HELLO 3`. Making
/// the parser total costs a few lines now; meeting an unexpected type later and
/// reporting it as *malformed* would send somebody hunting a corruption that is not
/// there.

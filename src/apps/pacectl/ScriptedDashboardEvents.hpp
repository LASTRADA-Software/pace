/// @file ScriptedDashboardEvents.hpp
/// A dashboard event source that is a LIST.
///
/// This is the fake the whole *100% mockable* constraint rests on, so two things about
/// it are load-bearing rather than incidental.
///
/// **It PARKS.** Every `Next()` suspends through the injected reactor before it answers,
/// even though the answer is sitting in a vector. A source that resolved synchronously
/// would satisfy `IDashboardEventSource` and make every property defined by waiting
/// vacuous while appearing to pass -- a tick arriving while a fetch is outstanding, a
/// quit during a slow sample. The rule is stated on `ITerminalChannel::Read` for the
/// same reason and it is the one this file exists to honour: **a fake that resolves
/// what production suspends on cannot exercise a suspension protocol.**
///
/// It parks through `core::net::EventLoop::Schedule` -- the same door production parks through --
/// so under `core::net::testing::TestLoop` the resumption is still placed by the test rather than raced.
/// Determinism comes from the reactor being deterministic, not from the fake being
/// synchronous, which is the distinction that makes this honest.
///
/// **It runs out rather than repeating.** Past the end it answers `Detached`, so a loop
/// that asks for one more event than the script holds ends rather than spinning, and a
/// script that was too short says so by ending early rather than by looping forever.

/// Suspend and be resumed by the reactor, with no delay.
///
/// A zero delay rather than a real one: the point is that resumption goes through the
/// reactor's queue, not that time passes. `core::net::testing::TestLoop` therefore PLACES it, and a
/// production reactor costs one turn of its loop.
///
/// It borrows the handle rather than taking `core::async::ParkedWork`, which is correct here and
/// worth saying because the choice looks arbitrary: the awaiting chain is rooted in the
/// task the caller owns and awaits, not in a `core::async::DetachedTask`, so nothing but that caller
/// may free it -- which is exactly when `core::net::EventLoop::Schedule`'s borrowing overload is the
/// right one.

/// The production `IDashboardEventSource`: a live-stats subscription, a terminal and a stop
/// request, merged into one ordered stream on one reactor.
///
/// **Every producer is a coroutine parked on the reactor, and nothing on the reactor
/// sleeps.** The stream runs `TakeFrame`'s two hops off the reactor and back for every frame,
/// waits on a `core::net::DeadlineTimer` before subscribing again, the terminal's own source parks on
/// whatever it reads, and a stop request blocks on a waiter thread of its own before it hops
/// back. So a keystroke that lands while a read is still on the pool is delivered while that
/// read is still on the pool: nothing here waits for one producer before hearing another, which
/// is the property a dashboard that must answer `q` while a node is slow exists to have.
///
/// **The server keeps the cadence, not this source** (#1399). A reading arrives when the node
/// pushes one; nothing here polls. What this source decides is what to do when a stream ends:
/// follow a `NotLeader` to the leader it names, subscribe again after one interval, or end the
/// session when nothing has been read and waiting cannot help.

/// The `Detached` a source delivers when its stream cannot be read and waiting cannot help.
///
/// Named, because the other `Detached` -- the one a read of a CLOSED source answers -- has the same kind:
/// a case that looks only at the kind cannot tell a session that ended itself from one its caller closed.

/// Pointers are borrowed and must outlive the source's drain, not merely the source: a read
/// already on the pool when the session ends is still inside `subscription` there, and nothing
/// can call it back -- closing the source asks the subscription to LEAVE, and the read returns
/// once the node has closed the stream. The terminal and the stop request are OWNED, because
/// nothing but this source reads them and closing them is part of closing the session -- and
/// each is released the moment nothing waits on it any more, whatever a read on the pool is
/// doing, which is what restores the terminal and the signal disposition.

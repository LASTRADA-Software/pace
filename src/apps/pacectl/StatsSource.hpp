/// Where `pacectl stats` gets its numbers, and how it decides.
///
/// **There are three sources of wildly different richness and no single best one.**
/// Measured against this tree: the admin surface's `/metrics` carries roughly 102
/// catalogued counters plus 24 storage series and five more per present cache tier;
/// memcached's `stats` carries 24 fields; RESP `INFO` carries **seven**, in three
/// sections, and ignores any section argument it is given.
///
/// So a stats command that names one source is either thin or unavailable. The answer
/// is a ladder -- richest first -- with **one pure decision function** over what each
/// source said, which is what keeps this from becoming the "two commands discovering
/// the daemon two different ways" that #134 warns against. The chosen source is
/// reported as a field on stdout, not merely as a remark, because *which numbers am I
/// looking at* is something a machine consumer needs too.

/// One place stats can come from.
///
/// A private enum. The ladder's order IS this enum's order, richest first, which is
/// the one thing about it that is load-bearing.

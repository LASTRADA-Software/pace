/// Turns one `0xFC` request into one reply, for a node's own cache tier.
///
/// **Pure**: bytes in, bytes out, the same shape `Cc::WorkerProtocol` and
/// `Distributed::SchedulerProtocol` already have. It opens no socket, so the whole
/// verb surface is testable by handing it a frame.
///
/// ## Why a node answers cache verbs at all
///
/// So `pace-cc` can talk to **localhost** and still get the shared cache's
/// contents. The launcher used to dial the shared `pace-kv` directly, which
/// means every miss and every hit crossed the network — including for objects this
/// machine compiled minutes ago. Pointing the launcher at its local node puts
/// `LocalCache` in that path, and that is what makes a rebuild on a slow link free.
///
/// A tier answers the fetch and store verbs its `CacheTierProfile` names, plus `CacheDrop`
/// where the profile serves it, and nothing else: the private tier `Fetch`, `Store` and
/// `CacheDrop`, the fleet's shared tier `SharedFetch` and `SharedStore`. The other tier's verbs
/// are refused `DispatchNotPermitted` here, naming the other tier: they are served on this node,
/// by the tier whose profile names them. The scheduler's verbs belong to `SchedulerProtocol`
/// and `Compile` to `WorkerProtocol`; each refuses the others with `DispatchNotPermitted`, as a
/// reply rather than a close, so a client that reached the wrong port learns which.
///
/// `Auth` is the exception, and refusing it correctly is a **wire contract**: it
/// is answered `CompileCacheWire::UnimplementedVerb`, because that is the one
/// refusal `Cc::CacheProtocol` reads as "this endpoint implements no credential"
/// and proceeds past. Any other code makes the launcher treat the exchange as
/// fatal and miss every subsequent compile in silence. See `RefusedVerbs` in the
/// implementation for why that is a table row rather than a comment.
///
/// **The name, not the enumerator it aliases.** `UnimplementedVerb` is today
/// `ErrorCode::UnknownOpcode`, and naming the alias here rather than the contract
/// is how three surfaces came to spell one refusal separately and then disagree
/// about it (#283, #340).

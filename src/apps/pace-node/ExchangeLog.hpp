/// the whole request path was silent: `WorkerProtocol.cpp` held no logger reference at
/// all, and a live node's journal was startup and the toolchain survey and then
/// nothing, however many compiles it served. An operator watching
/// `journalctl -u pace-node -f` through an entire build saw not one line,
/// so "is anything reaching this node" was answerable only from `/metrics` -- which
/// tallies but does not say WHO, WHEN, or WHICH KEY, and is therefore the wrong
/// instrument for the question an operator actually asks first.
///
/// The counters stay the load-bearing signal; this is the narrative beside them, and
/// the two answer different questions. A counter says a refusal happened; a line says
/// which peer was refused which verb at what time.
///
/// ## Why a level per VERB rather than one level for the surface
///
/// The rates differ by orders of magnitude and so does what a line is worth. A build
/// issues thousands of `fetch`/`store` exchanges, one per translation unit or more --
/// at `Info` those bury every other line in the journal, which is how a log stops
/// being read at all. A `lease` or a `compile` is one per translation unit
/// DISTRIBUTED, takes seconds, and is exactly what an operator is looking for. So the
/// level is a column, `Debug` for the high-rate verbs and `Info` for the ones whose
/// arrival is itself the event.
///
/// The consequence is deliberate: at the default level the journal shows scheduling
/// and distribution, and `--log-level=debug` adds the cache traffic underneath it.

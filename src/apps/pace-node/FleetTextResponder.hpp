/// **Its own component rather than a verb of `LiveStatsResponder`**, whose every answer is a
/// stream and whose hooks are sized for one: a subscription holds its own byte budget and is never
/// watched as an answer, and a request answered in microseconds wants the endpoint's ordinary
/// accounting instead. What the two share is the part that must not diverge -- who may read the
/// fleet (`DecideFleetRead`) -- and the sources the document is read from.
///
/// **The body is `ILiveStatsSources::FleetText`'s**, which on a node is `AnswerFleetText`, the
/// function `/fleet.txt` answers from; this component renders nothing, so the verb and the route
/// cannot be two renderers.

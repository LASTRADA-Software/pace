/// **The node checks no password.** `--scheduler-token-file` is gone, and so is the gate it fed:
/// admission is `RefusePeer`'s, decided from what a connection established. What an `AUTH` can
/// still establish is which MACHINE a verified ticket speaks for, and that is a question every
/// node answers whatever components it runs -- which is why this is a component of its own
/// rather than a verb of the scheduler, and why it is never null on a built node.
///
/// **`AUTH` is terminated by the endpoint**, which asks `CheckCredential` and records the verdict
/// on the connection; it never reaches `Answer`. A password `AUTH` is answered `NoPolicy`: `Ok`,
/// establishing nothing, so a token-configured launcher is not broken by a node that requires
/// none. A machine ticket is verified against this node's roster, and an accepted one says WHICH
/// machine the connection speaks for.
///
/// **`MINT-TICKET` is served on LOOPBACK only, judged per connection from the kernel's peer address
/// and never from a cache.** A ticket is this machine vouching for its caller, so the one caller it
/// must never vouch for is on another machine -- and the interval-refreshed `ILocalityOracle` the
/// cache tier trusts fails OPEN for up to one refresh after this machine loses an address. For
/// FETCH that window leaks this machine's own objects; for a credential it is a wrong answer that
/// looks right, since every node in the fleet then admits the ticket's bearer as this machine. So
/// there is no cache and no oracle here, and loopback is the whole rule: a launcher mints from its
/// OWN node over loopback, which the default bind serves, whatever endpoint it goes on to present
/// the ticket at. One that dials its own node by a LAN address is refused `NotAMember`.
///
/// **One misconfiguration defeats it, and it is named here because nothing can detect it: a relay
/// in front of the node surface.** A reverse proxy or port forwarder on this machine, or a NAT that
/// hairpins remote clients onto the node over loopback, makes every client it relays "this
/// machine", and each would be minted tickets that speak for it. Never put one in front of the
/// `0xFC` port.

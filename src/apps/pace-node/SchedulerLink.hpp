/// is `main.cpp`, which is in no test target -- the same reason
/// `MakeWorkerLeaseValidator` moved out of `main` rather than staying a lambda
/// there.
///
/// ## Why a node has to follow a redirect at all
///
/// `SchedulerService::Gate()` refuses **every** verb, `Register` included, when the
/// node it reached is not the leader. Before this existed, the heartbeat thread
/// dialled the configured `--scheduler` unconditionally and logged the refusal, so
/// after an election every worker went on announcing itself to the demoted node,
/// expired out of the new leader's registry inside the heartbeat timeout, and the
/// leader answered every lease `NoWorker`. A launcher that correctly followed the
/// redirect -- the client half of
/// [#237](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/237) -- then
/// arrived at a leader with an empty fleet and compiled locally, behind a green
/// build and counters that all read zero. This is the other half.
///
/// ## What is remembered, and when
///
/// A leader is committed only once a round has actually been **accepted** there,
/// never merely because some scheduler named it. A redirect this node followed to
/// an endpoint that then refused for its own reasons -- not a member, a
/// fingerprint it will not take -- must not become the endpoint every future round
/// starts at. So `Redirect` moves this round, and `Accepted` is what makes it
/// stick.
///
/// A remembered leader that stops answering is forgotten and the configured
/// scheduler endpoint is tried again **in the same round**, rather than a heartbeat
/// interval later: the configured endpoint is the one an operator can actually
/// fix, and skipping a round to reach it doubles the window in which this machine
/// is missing from the fleet.
///
/// ## Several configured endpoints (#1310)
///
/// `SchedulersOf` is a list, and the fallback walks it: a round that cannot get
/// through at one configured endpoint tries the next, still in the same round, until
/// each has been tried once. The walk starts at the configured endpoint that last
/// ACCEPTED a round, so a fleet whose first entry was retired pays that entry's
/// connect timeout once rather than every heartbeat -- and it wraps, so an operator's
/// first choice is still tried in a round that begins further down.
///
/// **Each configured endpoint is dialled at most once per round.** A redirect target
/// that then fails falls back to the next configured endpoint NOT yet tried, never to
/// the one that just issued the redirect: that one answered a moment ago and would
/// name the same unreachable leader again. Every round is therefore bounded by the
/// list's length plus `MaxAnnounceRedirects`.
///
/// A `NotLeader` is an INSTRUCTION and is followed to the endpoint it names without
/// consulting the list at all -- the list says where to start asking, never who leads.

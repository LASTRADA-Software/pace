// #1471, clauses 2 and 3, restated for a forget that is a key revocation: a forget committed on
// the leader must be REFUSED at a second machine, attributed there to the revoked key, and a
// machine that has not applied the entry must answer differently.
//
// #1309 proved each layer apart -- the oracle, the publish, the apply, the refusal -- and did not
// prove them composed across a pair. So every case here drives them at once:
//
//   * the real `SchedulerService` and `SchedulerProtocol`, through `FleetHarness`, decide whether
//     the caller is served,
//   * a real `NodeMembership` per machine holds what that machine has applied, and folds the
//     identity the caller's connection proved exactly as production's endpoint does.
//
// **A machine is forgotten by its key, and an address is not an identity.** The caller here
// proves an identity key (`FleetHarness::SetCallerIdentity`); the forget revokes that key; and the
// refusal is asserted from an address that is NOT the one the machine was admitted at, beside a
// control from the same address under a key nobody revoked. A case that forgot a host would pass
// over a build that still refused by address.
//
// **The refusal is asserted by CODE, never by "the exchange did not succeed".** A dozen
// arrangements decline a lease -- no worker, no capacity, a follower with no leader -- so a case
// checking only that it failed would pass under every one of them and prove nothing about a
// forget. `Wire::ErrorCode::NotAMember` is the fact under test.

/// Every `pace-node` command line the documentation shows must be one
/// the binary would actually start on.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// Six documented command lines exited at startup rather than starting (#563), two
/// of them the whole of the getting-started page's "Setting it up". A reader
/// following the page hit a refusal on their first attempt, with nothing to say the
/// document was wrong rather than their environment. Four more sat on
/// `docs/tools/pace-node.md` -- the page #463 had already fixed once
/// for the identical shape, which is what says the examples were written before the
/// refusals and never re-run.
///
/// Nothing connected the two. The option table decides what starts; the prose is
/// prose. `node-config-reference` already covers exactly this gap for the shipped
/// reference *configuration*, and the ticket's own suggestion was that the idea
/// works and wants extending. This is that, one layer in.
///
/// ## Why it does not run the binary
///
/// Spawning would need a free port, a key file that exists, and a machine with no
/// service already on the documented ports -- and it still could not see a
/// **default**, because a default never appears in argv. The survey that found
/// these six failed on precisely that: a command line relying on the loopback
/// default collided with a running service and reported a defect that was not one.
/// Parsing with the real `NodeOptions()` and running the real
/// `StartupPolicyRejection` asks the same question with none of that, and asks it
/// about the whole configuration rather than the part that happened to be spelled
/// out.
///
/// ## What it cannot see, measured rather than assumed
///
/// **Refusals that are not in the table.** This runs `StartupPolicyRejection`, so a
/// cross-flag rule enforced anywhere else is invisible to it. That is not
/// hypothetical: run against the pre-fix documentation this check reports SIX of the
/// seven defects and misses `tools.md:1099`, whose only fault was a missing
/// `--scheduler` -- refused by an inline `if` in `main.cpp` rather than by the table.
///
/// That gap is **a bug in the table, not a boundary of this check**
/// ([#386](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/386)): the rule
/// depends on nothing but the parsed configuration, which is precisely what
/// `platform-service-and-config.md` says belongs in a table "never in the tier that
/// happens to need it". Its install-time twin already IS a row, so the two agree by
/// coincidence rather than by construction. When #386 lands this check gets wider
/// for free and no line here changes. It is left open only because the fix collides
/// with #403 in `main.cpp`, not because it is settled.
///
/// Whoever moves that row: it belongs in `StartupPolicyRejection`, **not** in
/// `NodeServiceRejection`, which #386 as filed names. That one is install-time only
/// -- its sole production caller is `NodeInstallRejection` and its messages say
/// "required *to install a service*" -- so deleting the inline `if` in favour of it
/// would let a node START with an empty `--scheduler`, which is the refusal the
/// ticket exists to protect.
///
/// **Anything past the startup policy**: a flag whose *value* is wrong in a way only
/// a running node discovers, a path that does not exist, a port already held. Those
/// are properties of a machine rather than of a command line, and a check that tried
/// to have opinions about them would fail on every developer's box for reasons the
/// documentation cannot fix.
///
/// **This whole binary is gated on `PACE_BUILD_NODE`.** Configure with it
/// `OFF` and this check silently stops running while `node-config-reference` carries
/// on -- so a docs-only change validated in such a tree is validated by less than it
/// looks. That is the same shape as the sweep-scope trap in
/// `build-and-toolchain.md`: a check is only as complete as the target set that
/// built it.

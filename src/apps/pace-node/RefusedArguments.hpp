/// Which arguments this worker refused compiles over, said where an operator looks.
///
/// `pace_worker_jobs_refused_rejected_argument_total` says how many jobs a worker turned away
/// over an argument, and until this existed nothing on the node said WHICH: not its log, not its
/// conditions. A cl-debug build had 372 of them refused over one flag, and the only way to learn
/// which flag was to reproduce a dispatch by hand. The remedy -- `--allow-compile-arg`, or leaving
/// those compiles local -- needs exactly the name nothing reported.

namespace Pace::Node
{

/// Raises `refused-compile-arguments` naming what this worker refused, and logs each argument once.
///
/// **A row AND a line, and the line is rate-limited by what it says rather than by a clock**: an
/// argument is logged the first time it is refused and never again, so a build refusing one flag
/// ten thousand times writes one line, and the row keeps the count. After `MaxNamedArguments`
/// distinct arguments nothing further is logged or named -- one line says so -- because a client
/// sending an endless stream of distinct arguments must not be able to fill this node's log or
/// grow its memory. The row's detail is clamped by `NodeConditions::Raise` in any case.
///
/// **Live, and RE-JUDGED when the allowlist changes.** A reload that changes `--allow-compile-arg`
/// is the operator acting on this row, so the arguments the new list admits leave it and every
/// other stays -- the row reads `clear` only when nothing it named is still refused, which is how
/// *fixed* and *still refused* come to look different. A job that started under the old list and
/// reports after the change is judged by the list now in force.
///
/// **A refusal names EVERY argument its job was refused over (#1681), and is still ONE compile.**
/// So compiles are counted by the SET of named arguments they carried, and a compile leaves the
/// count only once every argument of its set is admitted: admitting one of a compile's four
/// arguments leaves it refused over the other three, and a count that dropped then would say
/// fewer compiles are refused than are.

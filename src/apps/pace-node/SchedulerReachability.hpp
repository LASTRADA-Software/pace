/// ## Why this exists

/// Both announce loops -- the worker's heartbeat and the machine's presence -- logged every

/// on EVERY round: one line per loop per `NodeAnnounceInterval`, about 360 an hour on a machine
/// running both. A log that says the same thing 360 times an hour is one nobody reads for the line
/// that changed.
///
/// ## The rule, keyed on the round's OUTCOME
///
/// A setback lives at a place, `(scheduler, subject)`, and carries the outcome that made it. A
/// failure at a place with no setback, or with one of a DIFFERENT outcome, is a transition.
///
/// - **At most one Warn per scheduler per cadence, and the budget counts LOSSES.** A transition is
///   said at Warn (`Lost`), unless that scheduler had a Warn inside the cadence (`Further`, Info), or
///   the same outcome at the same place was already opened above Debug inside it (`Relapse`, Debug).
///   Otherwise a flapping VPN link is 90 Warns an hour through a different door.
/// - **While a setback lasts:** a reminder at Info once per cadence (`Reminder`), Debug otherwise
///   (`Repeat`).
/// - **The recovery is said at the level of the loudest line said about that setback** (`Regained`):
///   a Warn loss is answered at Warn, a dampened loss quietly. An operator never told something went
///   away is not told it came back; one who was told is.
/// - **A success at a stage ends a setback of that stage or an earlier one** (`AnnounceStage`).
///
/// ## Only what is still being asked
///
/// A setback, a Warn record or an opening record nothing touched for a whole cadence is forgotten,
/// silently. `SchedulerLink` lets go of a remembered leader that stopped answering, and a machine
/// that slept dialled nothing: about either, "still" and "again" are claims this process can no
/// longer make. A failure after that is news again, at Warn.
///
/// ## ONE per process
///
/// `main` owns one and lends it to both loops, so a machine says each transition once rather than
/// once per loop. Two threads therefore call in, hence the mutex. The clock is injected, as for
/// every other time-dependent answer here.

/// Every function on a framed endpoint that may put bytes on a connection.
///
/// **A PRIVATE enum: nothing transmits it, nothing persists it, and it must not gain
/// an explicit `= N`** -- a value on a private enum asserts a contract that does not
/// exist. It is an argument each write names, and its ordinals are this build's alone.
///
/// ## Why a table for five functions
///
/// `FrameEndpoint`'s connection loop has an **exactly-one-writer** property: what goes
/// out on a connection, and in what order, is decided by one statement sequence. The
/// property was *structural* -- the loop was the only writer because it was the only
/// thing that wrote -- and structural is a property nothing tells you about
/// ([#675](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/675)). The loop also
/// sits at clang-tidy's cognitive-complexity ceiling, so the next lane that has to
/// reduce it meets a function that punishes the obvious way of doing so: extract the
/// nearest block and, as likely as not, you have extracted the write. The property is
/// then an agreement between two functions rather than a fact about one, and what it
/// costs is an interleaved partial write, which on this wire is a desync rather than an
/// error -- a client reading a length out of the middle of somebody else's frame.
///
/// So a write NAMES which of the sanctioned writers it is. A sixth writer is a sixth
/// row carrying its own reason, which is a thing a reviewer sees; it is not a
/// `WriteAll` call that appeared in a helper, which is not. That is a refusal by ROW
/// where there was previously only a refusal by absence, and the two are the same
/// answer only while nothing else is consulted.
///
/// ## What this table does, and what now enforces it
///
/// The table itself is still a declaration: it names who may write and why. What
/// changed is underneath it. `core::net::contract::claimWriteSlot`
/// (`core/net/SocketContract.hpp`, core-cpp's since #893 moved there) is the write-side
/// mirror of `claimReadSlot`, folded INTO the operation so no arm site has a line to forget it
/// on -- which is the shape
/// [#1218](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1218) asked for and
/// somebody else built while answering a TLS pump bug.
///
/// **It reaches the case this table is about, and the reason is `WriteAll`.** That
/// helper sends a whole frame in ONE `core::net::ISocket::Write`, so a write that PARKS is a
/// half-sent frame -- and a second writer arming over it is precisely the interleaving
/// named above: a client reading a length out of the middle of somebody else's frame.
/// Arming a write over a parked one is what the claim refuses. A write that completes
/// inline takes no claim and needs none, because an unparked frame is atomic on this
/// path.
///
/// **It ends the process in every build since core-cpp 0.3.0**, naming the direction and
/// the socket's handle. Until then it was Debug only, and a Release double-arm displaced
/// the parked write, which was then never resumed -- a hang with no message. Refusing the
/// new operation instead is still wrong: it would turn a misuse into a broken connection
/// on a live path, far from the site that caused it.
///
/// Watched by core-cpp's `socket-contract-canary`, on its Debug and Release legs. The
/// pace-kv canary that watched it both ways (#1031) went with `Net/` to core-cpp.
///
/// ## What is still NOT enforced
///
/// Nothing stops a new helper simply naming `Loop`. The scan that reads this table
/// cannot say which FUNCTION a call sits in without parsing bodies, and it does not --
/// so the row remains a refusal by ROW, which a reviewer sees, rather than a property
/// a compiler checks. Stating the residue plainly is the point: a guard described as
/// stronger than it is gets trusted for the case it does not cover.
///
/// `Stream` is not concurrent with anything: it writes while the loop is suspended inside
/// `ServeStream`, and nothing else writes a connection that is serving a subscription.
///
/// Exactly one of these is CONCURRENT with another: `Pulse` writes while the loop is
/// suspended inside `IFrameResponder::Answer`, which is the one window in which the
/// loop writes nothing. `ReclaimFromPulse` is where the socket comes back, and it runs
/// before every write that follows the answer.

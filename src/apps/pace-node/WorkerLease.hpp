/// returns none, and parking it there put the node's entire parsed configuration on
/// the interface of a header whose subject is a socket and an executor.
///
/// It is out of `main` for the reason this repository states as a rule: a check
/// nothing constructs is the bug it was written to fix, and `main` is the one
/// translation unit no test can reach. That is exactly where an accept-all lambda
/// survived a fully passing suite (#282).
///
/// No roster yields `Cc::UncheckedLeaseValidator()` and a warning, and is legitimate for
/// exactly one shape of node: one no other machine can dial. `StartupPolicyRejection` and
/// `NodeRoster::Build` refuse every other shape before this runs, so the choice is made once,
/// in front of the operator, rather than per request where an open port and a zeroed counter
/// look like a healthy fleet.
///

/// majority of the voters certified on any other node.

/// @param roster What a grant is verified against, or null when this node holds none. Borrowed

///        reason this refuses rather than only warning.** `StartupPolicyRejection`
///        decides reachability from `--bind`, which is the right answer for a node
///        that binds its own port and is worth nothing for one that does not: under
///        socket activation the unit chose the address -- the shipped
///        `pace-node.socket` says `ListenStream=6676`, every interface --
///        and a leftover `--bind=127.0.0.1` in `FASTCACHE_NODE_ARGS` is ignored while
///        still telling the table this port is local. That combination passed the
///        table, built the unchecked validator and served an unauthenticated compile
///        port to the network, with all three refusal counters reading zero: the exact
///        defect #282 exists to close, surviving inside the fix for it. The table
///        keeps its rule because an install must be refused before any tier exists;
///        this is the backstop for the one fact the table cannot see.
/// @param advertise Where this worker's address is read, asked per request rather
///        than copied here -- exactly the seam the registration reads, because the

///        have to be one fact at every moment, not two readers of one file (#1279).
///        Borrowed by the validator, so it must outlive it.
/// @param identityKey This node's identity public key, the one it proves itself with: a grant
///        whose signed claims name another machine's key is refused (W-4). Copied; empty for a
///        node that proves nothing.
/// @param clock Where "now" comes from. A **wall** clock, not a steady one: the
///        expiry was stamped on another machine, and a steady instant means nothing

/// @param lease What this node keeps between lease checks -- the grants it has already
///        run (#614), the scheduler term it last learned (#421), and where a term going
///        backwards is reported. Borrowed by the validator, so it must outlive it, and
///        shared by every compile thread. Taken even on the paths that build an
///        unchecked validator, because whether a node has a roster is not a reason for its
///        caller to hold a different set of objects.
/// @param metrics Where an adopted term reset is counted.

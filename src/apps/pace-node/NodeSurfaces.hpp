/// natural thing to reach for before writing a unit file -- so used that way it is a
/// pre-flight check, and it answered "fine" to a command line with no chance of
/// starting. The operator writes the unit and finds out at deploy time.
///
/// **Printing the map for a broken configuration is the feature; reporting SUCCESS
/// for it is not.** Those are two decisions that one `return 0` merged, and only the
/// second was wrong -- so the map is rendered exactly as before, unconditionally and
/// before any judgement, and the verdict travels beside it instead of replacing it.
/// An operator reaches for this flag BECAUSE a port is wrong, and withholding the
/// worksheet until the configuration is already valid would withhold it precisely
/// when it is wanted.
///
/// **The refusal is `StartupPolicyRejection`'s own text, never a second phrasing.**
/// A rule that depends on nothing but the parsed configuration belongs in that table,
/// and a second copy of its wording is a second thing to be wrong -- which is the
/// defect [#386](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/386) records
/// for this very ladder, one flag along.
///
/// **Why this is a function here rather than four lines in `main()`.** It is one of
/// FIVE verbs that answer and exit before the startup table ever runs
/// (`--print-surfaces`, `--install-service`/`--uninstall-service`, `--migrate-cache`
/// and the cluster actions), and that class has no name in the code. Written as a
/// special case at the call site, the next verb to want a verdict gets the same four
/// lines written a second time, in a file no test target compiles. The class members
/// do NOT all want the same answer, which is the part worth recording:
///
/// - `--install-service` is judged already, and by the STRICTER
///   `NodeInstallRejection` -- a registration replays its command line forever, so it
///   must satisfy the install rules as well as these.
/// - `--migrate-cache` deliberately is NOT judged. A store of the wrong vintage stops
///   the node running, and demanding a valid `--scheduler` first would be demanding
///   the operator fix a running configuration before being allowed to fix the thing
///   that stops it running.
/// - The cluster actions are NOT judged either: they are questions asked OF a running
///   cluster rather than a node starting, and they need a scheduler endpoint but no
///   toolchain.
///
/// So the mechanism is named and reusable, and each verb's answer is a decision on
/// record rather than whatever the ladder happens to give it.

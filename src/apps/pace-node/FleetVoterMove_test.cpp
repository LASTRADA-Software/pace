// A VOTER whose address vanished, announcing where it answers now through its OWN rounds -- the
// presence loop's NODE-ANNOUNCE and the worker's REGISTER -- rather than an announcement a case
// hands the leader directly.
//
// The membership side of a move (`AnnouncedEndpointDesires` coupling the Raft host, the commit,
// every node learning the new endpoint) is `Cluster/MembershipCluster_test.cpp`'s, and every case
// there injects the announcement AT THE LEADER. What only a fleet shows is whether the announcement
// gets there at all: a voter whose old address is gone hears no leader, so its own scheduler -- the
// first endpoint its rounds dial -- knows nobody to redirect to and answers `NotLeader` naming
// NOBODY. Before the fix the voter's rounds dialled nothing else (`AppliedSchedulers::Current`
// answered its own endpoint alone), so the leader never heard of the move and the voter stayed
// unreachable until its old address came back.

/// A worker's private scratch root, claimed exclusively for the life of the process.
///
/// ## What this closes
///
/// A worker derived its scratch root from `temp_directory_path() /
/// "pace-node"` and numbered jobs beneath it from a counter starting at
/// 1 in every process. So a second node on one host -- a service plus a hand-started
/// debug run, two instances an operator started, a container sharing a mount --
/// derived the IDENTICAL `job-1`, and with it the source path and the hard-coded
/// `tu.o` inside it. `create_directories` succeeds on a directory that already
/// exists, so the second process was told nothing (#279).
///
/// Both outcomes are bad and neither is loud:
///
/// - One worker's `ScratchGuard` removes the shared directory under the other, whose
///   compile then fails. The client falls back to compiling locally, so the BUILD
///   stays correct and distribution silently stops -- with nothing in any log saying
///   why. This is the same shape as #232, where the fleet cached nothing while every
///   counter read zero.
/// - Or the two compiles share `tu.o` and one answers with the other's object, which
///   its client then caches under its own key. A compile cache that answers with the
///   wrong object is worse than one that answers with nothing.
///
/// ## Claiming IS the check
///
/// Liveness is never decided by inspecting a process. A claim is an OS-level
/// exclusive hold on a lock file, taken non-blocking, and kept for as long as the
/// returned `IScratchClaim` lives. Three things follow, and each removes a hazard
/// that a pid-inspecting design would have:
///
/// - **No race.** There is no window between "is the owner alive?" and "I take it",
///   because acquiring the lock IS the answer.
/// - **`_Exit` stops being special.** `WorkerServer`'s abandoned-drain path
///   (`std::_Exit`, #239) bypasses static destructors, so the directory is leaked --
///   but the OS releases the lock however the process died. A leaked root is then a
///   root whose lock is FREE, which is exactly what "reclaimable" should mean. No
///   reaper has to reason about staleness.
/// - **A recycled pid cannot confuse it.** Nothing reads a pid to decide anything.
///
/// This is `CowTree::FilePageStore`'s rule applied to a directory rather than a
/// store file, and it diverges from that one deliberately in a single place -- see
/// `ScratchClaimRefusal::Unavailable`.

/// An endpoint this node states, now, held so every reader sees one value change at one point.
///
/// The production `Cc::IAdvertisedEndpointSource`. A process holds two kinds:
///   - the PUBLISHED endpoint (`main`'s, one per process), written by `EndpointResolver` alone and
///     read by the worker's heartbeat and the presence loop, which file this machine under it;
///   - the REGISTERED endpoint (`WorkerTier::Advertised`), written by the heartbeat alone as it
///     rebuilds the registrars, and the one the lease check verifies a grant against.
///
/// ## Why this is not `ConfiguredCredential`'s shape
///
/// `Node::ConfiguredCredential` answers from the live configuration snapshot on every
/// call, and that is right for a secret: a rotation should reach every presentation the
/// instant the operator's file is accepted, and nothing downstream has to be told.
///
/// An endpoint is not like that, because a second party holds a copy. The scheduler
/// files this worker under `(fingerprint, endpoint)` and signs that endpoint into every
/// grant, so a lease check that moved the moment a snapshot -- or a route -- changed would
/// leave this worker refusing authentic grants for the address the fleet still has, for
/// however long the heartbeat interval is, with `LeaseEndpointMismatch` rising and no
/// configuration anywhere being wrong.
///
/// ## What holds
///
/// **A grant for the endpoint this worker is registered under is honoured until the heartbeat
/// re-registers.** The resolver publishes a move on its own thread, but the lease check reads the
/// REGISTERED endpoint, which moves only in the step that queues the old registrations for
/// withdrawal and builds the new ones. And that step is not left for the next interval: a published
/// `0xFC` move wakes the heartbeat at once (`IEndpointMoveSink`), so the scheduler is told within a
/// round trip.
///
/// ## The window this still has, stated rather than hidden
///
/// A grant signed for the old endpoint and presented after the re-registration is refused, since
/// one endpoint is expected at a time. That is bounded by the grant's own lifetime,
/// counted (`LeaseEndpointMismatch`), and costs the client a local compile -- against
/// which the alternative, accepting any recently advertised address, widens the window
/// in which a captured token is replayable at this worker. Widening a replay window to
/// save a handful of dispatches is a decision this ticket does not get to make quietly.

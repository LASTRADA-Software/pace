///
/// ## Why this is a component of its own
///
/// Every other family names something a node may or may not run -- a cache tier, a
/// worker, a scheduler -- and these verbs must not depend on **which** of them is
/// running. A worker with no cache tier and no scheduler is an ordinary deployment, and
/// *what do you serve?* has to work there; filing these under any one component would
/// make the answer depend on that component being present. So `MergedResponder` gains a
/// fourth owner rather than a special case, and on a built node this owner is never null
/// the way the other three legitimately are.
///
/// **Not** *answerable by a node running nothing*: `StartNodeSurfaceOrExplain` serves no
/// `0xFC` port at all in that case, and this responder is deliberately not one of the
/// conditions it tests -- including it would make that guard unsatisfiable and open a
/// port on a node that serves nothing.
///
/// ## Why it exists at all
///
/// `pace-node` speaks `0xFC` and nothing else, so a client pointed at one
/// got a silent close and no way to find out why. Measured against the running node:
/// RESP `PING`, RESP `INFO` and memcached `version` each closed having sent nothing,
/// while a `0xFC` header got a proper refusal. `pacectl version` therefore reported
/// *the server closed the connection without answering* -- true, and useless.

/// What this node knows about itself.
///
/// A seam, because every field of it is ambient: the version is compiled in, the surfaces
/// come from the resolved configuration, the components from which tiers actually started,
/// and the uptime from a clock. A responder that reached for any of those directly would
/// be untestable by construction, which is the whole reason this interface exists rather
/// than a struct built in `main`.

/// Raises `foreign-fleet-visible` while another ESTABLISHED fleet is being proven on the segment
/// that no key this fleet holds proves to be this one split in two, naming both ids -- and
/// `fleet-split-healing` while one that IS proven so is seen: healing by itself, or waiting on an
/// operator where the evidence is only first-use trust (`Cluster::SplitHealing::ByOperator`).
///
/// Two established fleets yield to each other only on split evidence (`Cluster::SplitEvidenceFor`),
/// so two that can see each other with none keep building apart and caching twice until an
/// operator decides which machine belongs where -- and that is a condition row, because a log
/// line scrolls away and the operator who needs to know arrives later. The detail tells apart the
/// two cases an operator reads differently: no machine in common, and a fleet that CLAIMS to record
/// a machine of this one, unproven -- a look-alike somebody minted, or a member list cut short.
///
/// **What counts as foreign or healing is `ClassifyEncounter`'s answer, asked afresh with the
/// evidence read afresh, never a test of the two states here.** So this watch calls a pair healing
/// exactly while there is split evidence for a pair the encounter table would otherwise call
/// `ForeignFleet`, raises foreign for every other `ForeignFleet`, and moves a fleet between the two the
/// moment either changes.
///
/// **A fleet the pin keeps this node out of is raised as foreign too** (`Cluster::Encounter::PinnedElsewhere`):
/// a node that sits alone beside a fleet it would have joined must say why, naming the fleet and the
/// pin, whatever state either side is in -- and that is decided BEFORE a split is, since a fleet the
/// pin refuses is not one this node heals into either.
///
/// Every proven fleet of ANOTHER cluster is forwarded to `next`, whatever this decided: formation reads
/// the same stream, and a watch that swallowed what it did not raise for would starve it. A reply of
/// this node's own fleet is heard here and goes no further.

/// through `NodeConditions`, which is what every other thread reads.

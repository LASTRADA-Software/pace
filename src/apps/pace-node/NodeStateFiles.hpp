/// Every file a node keeps in its state directory, and who may have put it there.
///
/// **A file in the state directory is this node's only if nobody else could have WRITTEN it.**
/// The key is not the only file the node acts on: the id it answers to, the formation record it
/// runs by, the consensus store it replays, the endpoints it hands its credentials to and the
/// roster it verifies grants against are each as decisive, and each is one another account could
/// have planted with the contents it chose. So every entry of the state directory is asked who
/// owns it, and one another account owns is refused by name (`NodeKeyFault::ForeignOwner`),
/// naming the file, what it holds and the owner, and left as it is.
///
/// One row per file, each naming what trusting another account's copy would make this node do,
/// keyed by `StateFile`: the one enum every writer takes its file's name from
/// (`Core/StateFiles.hpp`). A new state file is a new enumerator, which does not compile without
/// a row here -- and a test runs every writer into a scratch directory besides, and requires a row
/// for each file it finds and a file for each row.

/// a Warn naming the directory and the refusal, and `StateFileReplacesFellBack`. And when its
/// filesystem cannot sync a directory at all (`Consensus::MeansDirectorySyncUnsupported`): a Warn
/// naming the directory and the answer, `StateDirectorySyncsUnsupported`, and the latched
/// `state-directory-unsynced` condition -- every replace there lands DEGRADED rather than refused,
/// and the remedy is an operator's (batch 3 review, B3-6), so it is a row and not a log line alone.
/// That row is answered on every path: raised, cleared by a probe that synced, or not evaluated by a
/// probe that could not run.
///
/// A fallback is the classic rename, which every replace still lands with -- but on Windows a reader
/// holding the file open then refuses it, which is the failure the POSIX-semantics rename exists to

/// `RowFor(NodeSurface::Node)` states the policy and the reasoning behind it, and

/// sound while the worker had a compile port of its OWN to fall back to. There is one

/// this -- both were answering "is this port load-bearing". The provenance bit is

/// @param io The loop this surface accepts and answers on.
/// @param cfg What the operator asked for.

///
///        **A worker with no tier and no scheduler still opens this port**, because
///        since #290 stage 3 it is the only place its compiles can arrive. That is the

// The toolchain walk, driven through the REAL threaded implementation.
//
// Why this file is here rather than beside `ToolchainProbe.cpp`: TSan coverage.
// `scripts/tsan-gate.sh` builds two binaries, and its row for this one is
//
//     "pace-node-tests|"
//
// -- an EMPTY tag expression, which that script documents as "run the whole
// binary". So every case in this target is sanitized, with no tag needed and
// without widening the TSan build scope. `pace-cc-tests` is not a target the
// gate builds at all, so the same cases beside `ToolchainProbe_test.cpp` would be
// unsanitized while looking exactly as covered.
//
// `ToolchainProbe.cpp` is compiled into this target through `_pace_node_shared`
// (`CMakeLists.txt`), and the node is also the process that actually pays the
// cold walk in production -- so the coverage lands on the binary that runs it.
//
// The cases beside `ToolchainProbe.cpp` assert what the walk COVERS, serially and
// deterministically. These assert that running it concurrently changes nothing and
// races nothing.

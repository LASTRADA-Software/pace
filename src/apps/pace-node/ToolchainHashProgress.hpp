/// Reports how fast the toolchain hash is going, while it is going.
///
/// **The instrument
/// [#354](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/354) has been
/// waiting eight sightings for.** That phase has been observed running past 300 s
/// on a CI runner without finishing, against a recorded cold cost of 5.00 ms per
/// file that would put 5136 files at ~26 s serial and less than that 16-wide. The
/// phase is now known; what is not known is *why*, and three candidates remain with
/// three different fixes: cold page cache, an antivirus in the path of every first
/// read, and per-file open cost dominating.
///
/// A ninth artefact of the same shape separates none of them. A **rate** does:
///
/// | what the rate does | what it points at |
/// | --- | --- |
/// | flat and slow from the first interval | per-file open cost, or a scanner |
/// | fast, then degrading | cache or memory pressure |
///
/// So this reports per-INTERVAL rather than cumulative. A cumulative figure cannot
/// answer a question about *now* -- 5000 files in 300 s and 5000 files in the first
/// 20 s followed by a wedge are the same average and opposite diagnoses -- and it is
/// exactly the reading `AGENT.md` records as having already cost this project a
/// session. The cumulative figure travels too, as evidence, never as the verdict.
///
/// **It reports files, not bytes, and says so.** The sizes are not available here:
/// this counts slice completions, one layer above the code that opens each file, and
/// inventing a byte figure from an average would be a number that looks measured and
/// is not. Where the bytes matter -- distinguishing "the digesting is the cost" from
/// "the opening is" -- the total is knowable separately and the comparison is made
/// against it rather than smuggled in here.
///
/// Thread-safe, and it must be: every slice thread observes into it. Exactly one
/// thread emits each line, chosen by a compare-exchange on the next deadline, so a
/// 16-wide walk produces one line per interval rather than sixteen.

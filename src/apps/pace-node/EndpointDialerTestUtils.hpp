/// Hands back one scripted socket per dial, and records where it was asked to go.
///
/// The seam `RunEnrollAdmin`, `RunClusterAdmin` and `AnnounceRound`
/// take, standing in for `BlockingEndpointDialer`. A fresh socket per dial is what
/// production does -- a poll re-dials, and a redirect or a fallback moves the endpoint
/// -- so one script per dial is the shape, not a convenience.
///
/// **One fake for every caller of the seam**, for `ScriptedSocket.hpp`'s reason: it
/// began as a copy inside `EnrollClient_test.cpp`, and a second copy for the heartbeat
/// would have been a fake nothing else exercises, drifting in silence.
///
/// **A script that RAN OUT and a dial that FAILED are different facts, and this fake
/// refuses to spell them the same way.** Production answers `nullptr` for a failed
/// dial and the callers report it as *cannot reach ...*. If exhaustion answered
/// `nullptr` too, a case that dialled once more than its author anticipated would
/// redden with that same sentence -- pointing a reader at the connector, at
/// `BlockingEndpointDialer`, at anything but the property the case is named for. That
/// is a true failure carrying a false diagnosis, relocated into the scaffolding where
/// nothing looks wrong because a fake is always more convenient than the thing it
/// stands for.
///
/// So the two are separated: an EMPTY entry is a dial this script fails deliberately,
/// and running past the end is a `FAIL` in the fake's own voice naming how far the
/// code under test got.
///
/// **The sockets outlive the dial.** Each connected dial hands out a decorator over a
/// `ScriptedSocket` this fake keeps, so a case can read what was SENT to the endpoint
/// that answered after the caller has dropped its connection -- which is how a fallback
/// case asserts WHICH endpoint took the request rather than only that one did.

///   proves a fresh one and retries ONCE. A failure on a FRESH session is the answer, and so is one
///   the exchange deadline caused: an expiry is a live machine that is slow, never a dead session.
/// - *Kept across a change* -- the setting moved, the machine was forgotten, its key revoked: every
///   operation compares its target (id, key, endpoint) with the one the session was proven for and
///   drops it on any difference. And the server re-judges admission on every verb, so a kept session
///   of a machine it has since stopped admitting is refused at its next verb -- and that refusal
///   ENDS the session, so the next operation meets it at a handshake.

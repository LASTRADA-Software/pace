/// `ConsoleLogger` with two of its three arguments, so `logTimestamps` existed
/// nowhere, could not be asked for, and no amount of correct `ConsoleLogger`
/// behaviour would have shown it.
///
/// **A test of a settings struct would not have caught it either**, which is why this
/// returns the logger rather than the numbers to build one with: `main` could read
/// such a struct and still drop a field, and the test would pass. There is one
/// construction path, production takes it, and the test takes the same one and reads
/// the bytes that come out the other end.
///
/// Nothing here is a policy. What the defaults are and why they are what they are
/// lives on `NodeConfig::logLevel` and `NodeConfig::logTimestamps`; this only carries
/// them to the one object that spends them.
///
/// `unique_ptr` because `ConsoleLogger` holds a `std::mutex` and so is neither
/// movable nor copyable -- a by-value factory will not compile, and an out-parameter
/// would put the construction back at the call site this exists to empty.

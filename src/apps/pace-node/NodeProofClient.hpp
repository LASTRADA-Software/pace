/// The proving half of the node handshake: what a machine does on every connection it opens to a
/// scheduler or to the fleet's shared cache, before the first verb it came to send (#178).
///
/// ## Why before anything else
///
/// The verbs a joining machine sends -- `Register`, `NodeAnnounce`, `Heartbeat`, `Withdraw`, `MachineBudget` --
/// require a proven identity (`CompileCacheWire::IdentityRequirement`), and what a proof
/// establishes is connection state. So a round that dials proves once, and every verb on that
/// connection is sent sealed, as the machine the cluster admitted.
///
/// ## It checks the SERVER too
///
/// The server signs first. A machine that holds a roster -- a consensus member, or a worker that
/// has adopted a certified one -- refuses to prove itself to a server whose key is not a live
/// voter's: a revoked ex-scheduler still named among its scheduler endpoints gets nothing, not even a proof
/// it could relay. A machine with no roster yet takes the server's word for its key, and the seal
/// is what still stops a relay from injecting verbs on the connection the proof admitted.
///
/// The shared cache asks a different question of the same signature: not *is this a voter* but
/// *is this exactly the machine the fleet named, under exactly the key the roster holds for it*.
/// That is a second `IServerTrust`, `NamedMachineTrust`, and which standings a machine proves
/// itself to is one table, `ServerStandingTable`, whichever trust produced the standing.

/// What a caller knows about the server that signed a handshake.
///
/// **PRIVATE: persisted and transmitted nowhere**, so its enumerators carry no explicit values.

/// trust answers the first four, the shared cache's the last three.

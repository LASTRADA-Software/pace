/// The private tier's upstream on the machine the fleet's `shared-cache` setting names: the shared
/// tier this process's `SharedCacheHost` publishes, read and written directly.
///
/// **Not a special case of `SharedCacheUpstream`, because none of its questions arise.** There is no
/// peer to prove -- the tier is in this process -- no credential to present and no admission to
/// ask, and a dial to this machine's own port would spend a handshake to ask this process something
/// it already knows. So it holds no connector, no dialer and no session: nothing here CAN dial.
///
/// **What it stores is already canonical.** The private tier's `CacheProxy` canonicalized the value
/// at the STORE that reached this node, as it does for everything `RemoteUpstream` forwards, so the
/// shared tier's `CacheProxy` -- which a frame would reach -- has nothing left to do and is not
/// reached: `SharedCacheTier::Store` takes the value as it is.
///
/// **It borrows the host for its whole life** (`SharedCacheHost::Borrow`): the host refuses to be
/// destroyed while this exists, so an owner that got the two in the wrong order is told so by name
/// at shutdown rather than reading a freed host -- or freeing the tier, and running its store's final
/// flush, on whichever thread finished the last call.
///
/// **It follows the setting at every call.** Each operation reads `SharedCacheHost::Current()` and
/// holds what it got for the whole call, so a move of the setting mid-read retires the tier rather
/// than freeing it under the read; once the setting names another machine, the next operation finds
/// no tier and answers as a node with no shared cache does. The move takes effect at the next apply
/// here, as it does on every other node.
///
/// **Safe from any thread, on a premise.** `Current()` is safe anywhere; what it hands out is then used
/// from the private tier's thread while the responder answers frames from the same tier on the
/// node's loop. That is safe because `DiskSharedTierOpener` gives the tier a store wrapped in
/// `ShareStorage` -- a single-shard `ShardedStorage`, which is the lock -- and `LocalCache` keeps no
/// mutable state of its own, counting into an atomic sink. A tier over a bare store, as the test
/// fakes build, is single-threaded only.

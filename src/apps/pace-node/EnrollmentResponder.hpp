/// The leader's enrollment list's front door.
///
/// ## Why this is a component of its own
///
/// `Op::Enroll` is `OpenBeforeAuth` and must admit a machine that is not a member --
/// a machine this cluster has never heard of is the entire population it serves.
/// The surface that could have hosted this pair answers *may this peer be here* through
/// the one membership check the scheduler's gate uses. So folding `Enroll` in would
/// either put the verb behind the answer that refuses it, or relax that answer for the
/// verbs beside it.
///
/// Separated, the change is purely ADDITIVE and that is checkable rather than argued:
/// no existing responder's `RefusePeer` or gate is touched, and the one door held open
/// is the one verb whose row in `OpTable` says so.
///
/// ## What it does not decide
///
/// Nothing durable, and nothing about the cluster. Approving a joiner goes through
/// `SchedulerService::ClusterAdmit` -- the same entry point `--cluster-admit` reaches,
/// with the same leadership-and-membership gate, the same `Cluster::Validate`, and the
/// same mapping from a consensus refusal onto a wire code. A copy of that mapping here
/// would be a second table to be wrong in, and the refusals an operator reads would
/// then depend on which door they came through.
///
/// What is here and nowhere else is WHICH refusal answers which condition on the
/// joiner's side, and which counter moves.
///
/// ## It is built only on a node that runs consensus
///
/// A node with no cluster has nothing to enrol anybody into, so `main` leaves the
/// component null and `MergedResponder` answers the whole family
/// `UnimplementedVerb` -- *this node serves no component for that verb family*. That
/// is the same shape every other optional component takes here, and it is better than
/// an enrollment surface that accepts requests and answers `NoCluster` to every
/// decision: a list that can never admit anybody should not record requests.

/// Serves `Enroll` and `EnrollControl`.

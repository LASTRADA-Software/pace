/// Where a caller proves WHICH machine it is, and its connection is sealed for having done so
/// (#178).
///
/// ## The problem, in one sentence
///
/// Node-to-node admission on the `0xFC` surface was decided by the caller's SOURCE ADDRESS, and
/// then by a MAC under a key every member shared -- so an address that changes per session could
/// not be followed, and a machine the cluster removed kept every byte it needed to prove itself
/// ([#178](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/178),
/// [#1428](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1428)). Each machine now signs
/// with its own identity key, and a revocation is one roster entry. `Distributed::NodeProof`
/// carries the handshake and why every frame after it is sealed.
///
/// ## Why a component of its own
///
/// `VerbFamily::NodeProof` carries that argument in full. The short of it: a proof is the caller's
/// OWN signature over this connection, while the `Session` family's `AUTH` carries a ticket -- a
/// statement another machine made about the caller -- so folding these verbs into it would let one
/// stand in for the other.
///
/// ## What it does NOT decide
///
/// Admission. It establishes one fact about one connection and writes it nowhere: the endpoint
/// records the proven identity on the connection, and `Node::RefuseUnlessMember` folds it into the
/// admission answer through `Distributed::ExplainConnection` on every verb. So this component
/// holds no state at all between requests, which is what lets one object serve every connection
/// on the port.
///
/// ## It is built only on a node that runs CONSENSUS
///
/// A proof is judged against the cluster's applied roster -- members and revoked keys -- which
/// only a node running consensus holds. Every other node leaves the component
/// null and `MergedResponder` answers the whole family `NoCluster` -- never `UnimplementedVerb`,
/// which a caller reads as *this node's build is too old* and acts on by upgrading a machine that
/// is already current.

/// Serves `NodeChallenge` and `ProveNode`.
///
/// Both verbs are terminated by the ENDPOINT, which owns the connection state they change; this
/// class is what the endpoint asks. `Answer` is therefore reachable only by a caller that went
/// round the endpoint, and says so rather than pretending to serve.

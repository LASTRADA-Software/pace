// What a re-survey owes the scheduler when a toolchain goes away
// ([#573](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/573)) -- and what a
// node owes it when the ADDRESS it is registered under moves
// ([#1279](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1279)). Two causes,
// one rule: a registration is retired unless the new set re-registers exactly it, and
// "exactly" is the registry's own key, `(fingerprint, endpoint)`.
//
// `AdoptRegistrars` exists as a free function because clang-tidy refused it as a
// lambda inside `WorkerBody` -- cognitive complexity 66 against a threshold of 60 --
// and the analyser was right for a reason beyond arithmetic: `main.cpp` is in no test
// target (#909), so the rule *replacing the served set retires what left it* could
// only be checked by reading, at two call sites that must not diverge. This file is
// what the extraction bought.

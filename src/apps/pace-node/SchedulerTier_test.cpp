// The tier is built in `WorkerBody` well before `nodeIo.Start()`, and the consensus
// driver reports a role from a callback that cannot run until that reactor is
// turning -- and then only once an election completes. So "before consensus exists"
// understates the window: it lasts until a leader is elected, which on a restarting
// fleet is an election timeout rather than an instant.

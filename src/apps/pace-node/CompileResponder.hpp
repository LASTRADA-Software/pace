/// The second half of #290, and it is **a change to how compiles RUN, not to how frames
/// are routed**. Routing a `Compile` to a component is one row of `MergedResponder`;
/// what makes it work is the two lines in `Answer` below, and they are the whole
/// subject of this class.
///
/// ## The reactor may not compile
///
/// `WorkerServer` serves its own port over a **blocking** listener, so one hop suffices
/// there: `Serve` steps onto the executor before it reads anything, and nothing after
/// that line suspends -- `core::net::BlockingSocket::Read` does its `recv` eagerly and hands back
/// an already-ready awaitable, so the whole request stays on the pool thread.
///
/// This surface is a **reactor**. A frame arrives on the reactor thread, and:
///
///   1. `_protocol.Answer` spawns a compiler and blocks for seconds. Run there it would
///      stall every other connection that reactor owns -- #213 one layer over, and the
///      worker would advertise `slots` while running one at a time.
///   2. The reply is written by `FrameEndpoint`'s connection task to a **reactor
///      socket**, so the answer has to come back to the reactor thread before it is
///      returned.
///
/// **Neither failure is visible at a call site.** A compile served on the reactor
/// produces a correct object; a reply returned from the pool thread writes a correct
/// socket, most of the time, on the platform you tested. So the property is asserted by
/// `CompileResponder_test.cpp` on the thread identities themselves -- a test that only
/// checks the object passes under both bugs.
///
/// ## It spends the worker's own accounting, not a second one
///
/// The `CompileCapacity` here is `WorkerServer`'s: the same slot cap, the same in-flight
/// byte budget, the same drain. Two counters would make one machine answer to two caps
/// depending on which door a client used, and the slot figure it advertises to the fleet
/// would describe neither.
///
/// ## What it does NOT change
///
/// Every policy is the one the dedicated port already applies. Membership is
/// `RefuseUnlessMember`, shared with the accept loop rather than restated. The lease is
/// checked where it always was, inside `Cc::WorkerProtocol`, by the validator this node
/// chose at startup. Nothing here widens who may compile on this machine -- the merged
/// listener is an additional door onto the same policy.
///
/// ## And it answers the cordon
///
/// `Op::Cordon` is the second verb of the `Compile` family (#1303), and it is here because
/// it governs exactly this surface's admission: a cordoned worker refuses a new compile
/// and lets the running ones finish. It is gated on LOCALITY rather than membership --
/// whether a machine's CPU serves the fleet is decided on that machine -- and it is a
/// round trip, not a compile, so every per-verb question below answers it as one.

///
/// **One function because there are now TWO ways not to be a member**, and five surfaces
/// spelled the one way by hand: `Classify(peer) == Member` or refuse. Five copies of a
/// one-armed decision were exactly as correct as one, which is why they were fine --
/// until a second arm arrived (#1309) and five files each had to grow it. That is the
/// shape this repository records as a table in disguise: the surfaces differ by a ROW and
/// a SENTENCE, so those are parameters and the decision is written once.
///
/// The alternative was a sixth copy per site, and the cost is not the typing. A surface
/// that was missed keeps compiling, keeps refusing the host correctly, and reports it as
/// a stranger -- a wrong diagnosis with nothing to notice, in a counter an operator reads
/// exactly when something has gone wrong.

/// The refusal a connection that proved a REVOKED identity key, or presented a ticket signed by
/// one, gets wherever it knocks (#178, #1555).
///
/// A machine is forgotten by its key, so this is the one refusal a forgotten machine gets: the
/// removed MACHINE itself, still holding its key and still dialling in. One row for every
/// surface, because the diagnosis belongs to the machine rather than to the door.
///
/// `NotAMember` on the wire, and the same code a stranger gets, because a CLIENT acts on
/// the two identically -- `pace-cc` steps over the refusal and compiles locally
/// either way, and a code of its own would be an unknown one to every launcher already
/// deployed. One code, two counters, which is the split `SurfaceRefusal` exists to hold.

/// already declines to say (`TicketRefusalSays`). What stays different is the counter, read on the
/// node. **On a `--fleet-open` node it DOES disclose**: an unknown ticket is served there and a
/// revoked one is not, and the self form of `explain-admission` answers the revoked ticket

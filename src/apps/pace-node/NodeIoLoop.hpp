/// The reactor the node's framed surfaces share, the connector over it, and the
/// thread that runs them -- owned as one thing.
///
/// ## Why this exists at all
///
/// Each `FrameEndpoint` used to own a `std::jthread` and serve its connections one
/// at a time. That is what made a slow upstream a node-wide fault: the cache
/// surface consults the shared cache from inside its own answer, so one dial that
/// took five seconds held every local `pace-cc` behind it. Making the dial
/// suspendable is only half the fix -- it needs a loop to suspend on.
///
/// ## This is NOT consensus's reactor, deliberately
///
/// `ConsensusTier` runs its own, and the two stay apart because a cache answer now
/// awaits an upstream dial with a multi-second ceiling. Putting that in front of
/// the Raft heartbeat timer would be this same defect moved one layer over, and
/// this repository already has a name for what that looks like: nine role changes
/// in twelve seconds.
///
/// The two framed surfaces DO share one loop with each other. Both are short
/// request/reply, neither is CPU-bound, and they have the same latency budget --
/// so a second thread would buy nothing but a second thread.
///
/// ## Header hygiene
///
/// This is the only node header that includes `PlatformReactor.hpp`, and that is
/// load-bearing on Windows: it drags in `<windows.h>`, and a header that did so
/// while also being included by anything wanting `<winsock2.h>` is the classic
/// redefinition. Every other signature takes `NodeIoLoop&`, which is
/// forward-declarable.

// reaching across would be the coupling the test denies. That argument is about the
// two BINARIES and it still holds: the shared header is neither one's -- it is test
// infrastructure both borrow, exactly as they both borrow `Unwrap.hpp`, and it
// includes nothing from either app.

/// What THIS scheduler answers, asked at the layer that does not serve the verb.

/// `DispatchNotPermitted` rather than `UnimplementedVerb`, and the distinction is the
/// one the rulebook records twice (#283, #340). *Unimplemented* is not *served
/// elsewhere*: telling a client this verb is unknown would say the daemon is too OLD
/// when it is in fact too new, and the launcher would step over the refusal and
/// proceed unauthenticated -- holding a token it never presented, then refused every
/// gated verb behind a green build.

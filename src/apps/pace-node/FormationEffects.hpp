/// The two moves that change which cluster a node runs, and finishing one at the next start.
///
/// **A node must have DISSOLVED its solitary cluster before it adopts a roster**: every node
/// bootstraps a cluster of itself, and what keeps a joiner from refusing every leader but its own is
/// that its solitary store is ARCHIVED -- moved out of the state directory's root and kept -- before it
/// starts as a learner.
///
/// **A move RECORDS where the node is going and moves no file.** The record names the store still in
/// the root (`archivePending`), the move asks for a reform, and the store is moved only by
/// `ResumeFormation`, which the start -- and the reform, which is a start of the body -- runs BEFORE any
/// consensus tier opens the directory. Not at the decision, because the decision is taken while that
/// cluster's tier still RUNS: it holds its log open and rewrites its state and snapshot into the root,
/// so a store moved under it is a store still being written. On POSIX the rename succeeds and a vote
/// or a snapshot after it re-creates the old cluster's files in the root, after the record said the
/// archive was done -- a node starting on the cluster it left, with no crash needed.

/// Whether @p roster, as a fleet handed it over, admits @p self into the fleet @p target PROVED: it
/// decodes, records this node's id under this node's key in the role it asked for, AND records a
/// member under the key that proved the fleet's summary -- the member that spoke, where it named
/// itself.
///
/// The ONE question a pending node asks of an admission's CONTENT, whether it is deciding what a poll
/// said or about to dissolve on it. It is asked only of an admission whose signature already bound it
/// to the fleet (`Cluster::VerifyAdmission`): a roster is public -- every member's id and key rides
/// every beacon -- so nothing here can tell the fleet's answer from a copy, and nothing here tries.
/// What it asks is whether the fleet's own answer is one to join: this node recorded as it asked, and
/// the member the join was decided on still in it.
/// @param self Who this node asked to be admitted as.
/// @param target The fleet it asked, as it was proven.
/// @param roster The roster's bytes, as received.
/// @return Nothing, or why the admission is not believed.

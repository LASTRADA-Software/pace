// Removing ONE machine from a cluster, end to end on the Raft peer wire (#178).
//
// Under the pre-shared key, removing a machine meant rotating the key on every other one: the
// removed machine still held it, and holding it WAS membership. Here each machine proves its
// own key, the cluster forgets one machine and so revokes its key, and nothing else changes
// anywhere -- which is the claim this file checks, with every production piece that carries it:
// the key files as a start mints and reads them, the replicated `Forget` an operator's
// `--cluster-forget` commits (#1555), the roster each node adopts from the state, and the real
// server and transport between them.

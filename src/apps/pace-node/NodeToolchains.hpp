/// Re-derive what this node serves, if the machine changed underneath it.
///
/// The whole of #238's decision, in one place a test can drive. A node fingerprints
/// once at startup and then lives for weeks while the launcher recomputes per
/// invocation, so a compiler patched in place leaves the node advertising the
/// pre-upgrade digest and spawning the post-upgrade compiler. Clients receive objects
/// built by a compiler they did not key against and store them in the shared cache
/// under the old key, where the whole fleet then reads them.
///
/// **It re-registers under the new fingerprint AND stops serving the old one, and
/// those are not alternatives.** Stopping is the load-bearing half -- it is the
/// wrong-object path -- but stopping alone would take a machine out of the fleet on
/// every routine upgrade, and a staggered rollout across an estate would empty the
/// fleet one machine at a time with nothing anywhere saying so. That is the same
/// silent-success shape the rest of this system is built to refuse, only slower.
///
/// A client holding a lease for a fingerprint that has just been dropped is refused
/// `UnknownFingerprint` by the worker and compiles locally. That answer, its wire
/// code and its counter already exist; nothing new is invented for this.
///
/// The re-survey is `ResolveToolchains` itself rather than a second, cheaper
/// derivation. A node whose identity was computed one way at startup and another way
/// afterwards would drift from its own clients exactly when an operator is least
/// able to see it.

///        `--no-toolchain-discovery` was given.
/// @param runner Process-spawning seam, for the compiler probes.
/// @param host The machine's filesystem, registry and environment.
/// @param clock Where the re-survey's progress rate reads elapsed time (#354).
/// @param logger Where the change is announced.

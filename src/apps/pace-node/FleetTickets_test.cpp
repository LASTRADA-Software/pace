// Machines admitted by ticket, across a fleet: a launcher on another machine leased capacity on
// its ticket alone, every way a ticket is refused, a learner verifying one against the state it
// applied, and a forgotten machine. Driven through
// `FleetHarness`, because each is decided by two machines -- the one that minted the ticket and
// the one it was presented to -- over the production verifier and the production fold.
//
// **Every case calls from an address nobody listed** (`SetCallerHost`), FIRST: loopback is
// admitted before any other route is asked, so a case calling from the default would pass with
// the ticket route removed. What each case names as its RED is proven by neutering; the
// real-endpoint half -- AUTH's state machine over a socket -- is `FrameEndpoint_test`'s.

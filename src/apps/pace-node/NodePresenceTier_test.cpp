// What a machine with no worker owes the fleet

//
// The half worth testing is `AnnounceMachineOnce`, and the reason it is a free function over a
// record is this file: the loop around it acquires a thread, a real host sampler and a real
// dialler, none of which a case can drive, while what decides anything is *what gets said* and
// *whether the history cursor moves*.
//
// **The cursor is the property with a direction that gets skipped.** Advancing it on a round
// that landed is the case everybody writes; leaving it alone on a round that was REFUSED is the
// one that matters, because a fleet re-electing is exactly when every endpoint refuses, and it
// is also exactly the history the handover exists to carry across an election. So the two cases
// below differ in ONE thing -- the scheduler's reply -- and a round that always advanced, or
// never did, fails exactly one of them. Neither alone tests anything.

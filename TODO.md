Evaluate the use of compression (various algorithms - zstd/lz4/zlib) for on-disk storage to reduce disk footprint and improve I/O throughput.
What are the pros and cons of each algorithm in terms of compression ratio, speed, and resource usage? How does compression affect the performance of read/write operations, especially for large datasets and very I/O heavy clients? Consider implementing a configurable option to enable/disable compression based on administrator preference or workload characteristics.

- [ ] CoW storage needs to expose the on-disk format version, such that we can identify old stores on newer fastcached versions with a newer on-disk format (to gracefully bail, or migrate)
- [ ] Add valgrind memcheck CI job to ensure no memory issues on clang release build
- [ ] Github CI should create a static `fastcached` binary and provide it as artifact.
- [ ] Add `fastcached stats` command to show in-process stats of the currently running instance (assuming we auto-detect it via config file)
- [ ] Add `fastcached live-stats` command to show in-process stats live on the terminal (using Sixels, if supported by the connected terminal, otherwise Unicode or ASCII art)
- [x] Reactor `UpdateInterest` swallows real `kevent`/`epoll_ctl` failures — surface them instead of stalling. See risk note below. **Done** — and the hazard was not hypothetical: `KqueueReactor::UpdateInterest` submitted both filter changes in one `kevent()` changelist with no eventlist, so the benign `ENOENT` on the `EVFILT_READ` delete aborted the batch before the `EVFILT_WRITE` add was applied. Every reply too large for the socket send buffer parked forever. Fixed with `EV_RECEIPT` (per-change results, no early abort); park sites now fail the awaitable instead of suspending when arming fails. Regression tests in `Net/KqueueSocket_test.cpp`.
- [ ] **Data-driven `ConfigMerge` (review follow-up — Group D #12).**
      The current `Merge()` in `src/Pace/Config/ConfigMerge.cpp` is 25
      hand-rolled if-branches; adding a Config field requires touching
      Config + CliResult bit + CliParser + YamlReader + Merge, and the
      `lruRecency` / `cpuAffinity` silent-drop bug from the
      transactions-keyspace-dual-listener review was the predictable
      consequence. Replace the if-ladder with a descriptor table
      (`{explicit-bit-getter, src-field-getter, dst-field-setter, mode}`,
      where `mode` is one of `ExplicitWins` / `NonDefaultWins`) and a
      coverage test that asserts every `CliResult::*Explicit` bit is
      referenced by exactly one descriptor — that guard fails fast the next
      time someone adds a field without wiring it into Merge.
- [ ] **Startup-failure log on partial bind (review follow-up — Group D #14).**
      `RunMultiReactorPosix` in `src/Pace/Server/ReactorServerLoop.cpp`
      binds `reactorCount × binds` listeners. When one bind fails mid-loop,
      the function logs a generic "cannot bind A:P on reactor R" and
      returns; the storage chain and reloader thread are already running.
      Add an `OnBindFailure` log path that names which (reactorIndex,
      bindIndex) pair failed and surfaces the kernel errno verbatim, so the
      operator can distinguish "port already in use on reactor 0" from
      "fd-table exhaustion on reactor 14". Inject a fake listener factory in
      `ReactorServerLoop_test.cpp` (create if absent) that succeeds for
      the first N calls then fails, assert the message names the
      offending pair.
- [ ] **HTTP/1.1 + JSON REST wire protocol (extra-clients survey, option B).**
      Add an HTTP/1.1 listener that speaks JSON for `GET /v1/keys/:k`,
      `PUT /v1/keys/:k`, `DELETE /v1/keys/:k`, `HEAD /v1/keys/:k` (TTL),
      `PATCH /v1/keys/:k` (CAS), `POST /v1/batch`, `GET /stats`, `GET /healthz`.
      Unlocks curl, browser `fetch`, serverless platforms that ban raw TCP,
      k8s sidecars, Prometheus-style scrapers. Architecture: new
      `HttpRest` `IProtocolHandler` under `src/Pace/Protocol/` —
      verb routing must be data-driven (descriptor table of
      `{method, path-shape, engine-call}`, **not** a hand-rolled
      `if`/`switch` ladder). Listener selection: introduce
      `BindConfig::protocol` (enum `auto | http | resp | memcached-text |
      memcached-binary`) so HTTP gets its own port and the
      `ProtocolAutodetect` one-byte peek stays unambiguous (HTTP method
      letters collide with Memcached text verbs). Future hook (out of
      scope for the first cut): WebSocket upgrade on the same listener
      gives browsers a bidirectional channel for the existing keyspace
      notifier — reuses `IPubSubRegistry`, no engine change.
- [x] Add support for Tracy (via CMake variable, off by default)
- [x] disk storage should be btrfs-like copy-on-write to allow O(1) blocking disk saves

## Risk note: ignoring `Attach`/`UpdateInterest` return values in the socket layer

> **Resolved.** Kept for the reasoning, which turned out to under-state the
> problem. The note assumed a `false` return was unreachable in practice; the
> actual failure needed no error at all, just kqueue's documented changelist
> semantics — an `ENOENT` on the first change silently dropped the second. See
> the closed item at the top of this file.

**Context.** `KqueueSocket.cpp` / `EpollSocket.cpp` call the reactor's
`[[nodiscard]] bool Attach(...)` and `bool UpdateInterest(...)` at fire-and-forget
sites and discard the result with `std::ignore`. Adding the macOS CI job surfaced
this on the kqueue side (`-Werror,-Wunused-result`); the epoll side already did it.

**Is ignoring the return safe? Mostly yes, today — but it hides a stability hazard.**

- Both methods return `false` *only* on precondition violations
  (`handler == nullptr`, `fd < 0`, dead reactor `_kq`/`epfd < 0`). At every
  ignore site the fd was just created/accepted and is known-valid, so `false` is
  unreachable in practice. Ignoring a value that is always `true` is harmless.
- The genuinely risky part is **inside** `UpdateInterest`: the real
  `::kevent(...)` (resp. `epoll_ctl`) result is itself `(void)`-discarded, so a
  `true` return does **not** mean the kernel accepted the interest change. The
  discard is intentional for the benign `ENOENT`-on-`EV_DELETE` case, but it also
  swallows *every other* failure (`EINVAL`, `ENOMEM`, `EMFILE`/fd-table pressure,
  etc.).

**Stability impact.** If an interest-arming call fails for a non-benign reason,
the reactor silently stops delivering readiness for that fd. The owning
connection coroutine then **suspends and never resumes** — a silent, permanent
per-connection stall with a leaked fd, rather than a clean error the client can
observe and retry. For a long-lived daemon whose primary goal is stability, a
silent hang is a worse failure mode than a reported error. This affects Linux and
macOS equally.

**Recommendation (not blocking; tracked above).**
1. Distinguish benign `ENOENT`-on-delete from real failures inside
   `UpdateInterest`; on a real arming failure, propagate it so the pending
   `IoAwaitable` is completed with an error (clean connection teardown) instead of
   stalling. Apply symmetrically to `EpollReactor` and `KqueueReactor`.
2. Once failures are reportable, reconsider the call-site contract: either keep
   `std::ignore` only where the return is provably non-actionable, or `assert()`
   the precondition-only sites to catch misuse in debug builds.
3. Leaving `std::ignore` in place for now is an acceptable interim state — it
   matches the existing epoll behaviour and does not regress anything — but the
   silent-failure swallow in (1) is the real fix for the stated stability goal.

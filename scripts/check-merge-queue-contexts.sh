# Every REQUIRED status check must be able to report a conclusion inside a
# `merge_group` event.
#
# ## Why this is a test and not a review note
#
# A merge queue dispatches `merge_group`. A workflow that does not listen for it
# produces no check run at all for that event, so a required context never
# reports — and a queued pull request does not fail, it **sits there**. That is
# the identical never-arrives failure as a `paths-ignore` filter on a required
# check (`.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md`), reached through a different
# door, and it presents as the feature working right up until the first pull
# request enters the queue.
#
# It is also invisible to every other check in this repository: the workflows are
# valid YAML, every job is correct, and nothing anywhere disagrees. The only
# observable is a queue that stalls.
#
# So the acceptance criterion for #351 is asserted rather than demonstrated once:
# for each required context, the workflow that produces it triggers on
# `merge_group`, the job still exists under that name, and its job-level `if:`
# does not exclude the event.
#
# ## What this cannot check, stated rather than left as an apparent omission
#
# The required-context LIST below is a copy of the `default-master` ruleset's
# `required_status_checks`, and nothing offline can verify a copy of a server-side
# setting. Read the live list with:
#
#   gh api repos/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/rulesets \
#     --jq '.[] | select(.name == "default-master") | .id'
#   gh api repos/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/rulesets/<id> \
#     --jq '.rules[] | select(.type == "required_status_checks")
#           | .parameters.required_status_checks[].context'
#
# A context added to the ruleset and not added here is not caught. A context here
# that no longer resolves to a job IS caught, which is the direction a rename
# breaks in. And a context added HERE and not in the ruleset is not caught
# either -- the direction a PROMOTION breaks in, and the costly one: this table
# is what `ci-merge-group-report.sh` reads to decide whether a merge-group
# failure still needs reporting, so while it leads the ruleset that leg's
# failure is classified *already surfaced* by a queue that never held on it.
# The trade-off is argued at `RequiredContexts` below; re-read the live list
# above before concluding a promotion is in force.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The two helpers the FOURTH door needs, defined HERE rather than beside their
# three siblings further down, because `--self-test` selects its own subject with
# them and a self-test cannot call a function defined below it. Finding that out
# cost nothing only because the case refuses when it can stage no defect; a
# selector that had silently matched nothing would have reported a passing tree.
#
# The FOURTH door, and the only one where the context REPORTS and is then taken
# back: a run cancelled by its own successor at the SAME head SHA (#761, #820).
#
# The first three doors are a context that never arrives -- no `merge_group:`
# trigger, a `branches:` filter, a job whose `if:` excludes the event. This one
# arrives, gets computed, and is discarded: the required context reads
# `completed/cancelled`, which is neither pass nor fail, so the pull request is
# blocked until a later run reports. Measured on `pr-labels.yml`, the 100 most
# recent runs to 2026-09-10T20:36Z: **14 cancelled**, each superseded by a
# same-branch run seconds to minutes later, and in three of four inspected by hand
# the labelling job had already SUCCEEDED before the verdict was thrown away.
#
# ## The rule is not "never cancel", and getting that wrong would refuse a
# ## correct workflow
#
# `build.yml` sets `cancel-in-progress: true` and is right to. It triggers on
# `push` and a bare `pull_request:` (`opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`), so a
# superseding run carries a NEW head SHA and the contexts it cancels belong to a
# commit no ruleset gates on any more.
#
# What makes it a defect is a trigger that fires WITHOUT changing the head SHA --
# `edited`, `labeled`, `unlabeled`. Then both runs answer for one commit, and
# killing the first destroys that commit's only verdict. So the two halves are
# read out of the file and ANDed; nothing here names a workflow, and `build.yml`
# is exempt because the rule does not reach it rather than because a list says so.
#
# ## What this does NOT cover
#
# A `concurrency:` block on a JOB rather than on the workflow. The refusal is
# therefore worded as "this workflow", and a job-level setting would pass -- said
# plainly, because a check silent about a case reads exactly like one that
# cleared it. No workflow here has one today.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every fact this check reads out of a workflow file, from ONE walk.
#
# Five awk programs used to live here, four of them structure readers spelling
# `build.yml`'s two-space indentation as literal column counts -- so each was
# right for the file as written today and answered nothing about a file whose
# jobs sit at another depth, which is legal YAML. They are now key PATHS over
# `scripts/lib/workflow-walk.awk` (#1456), which makes the depth the walk's
# problem; `scripts/check-merge-queue-contexts.awk` holds this check's half and
# documents the records.
#
# A missing awk program is refused BY NAME. A reader that ran over no program is
# not a clean tree, and awk's own complaint names a file rather than the check
# whose verdict just became meaningless.

# The table: one row per required context, naming the workflow that produces it.
# A context whose job lives in a matrix is written as the EXPANDED name, because
# that is what GitHub reports and what the ruleset names.
#
# ## This table is the one place the required-context COUNT lives
#
# The run prints `all <n> required contexts ...` from `${#RequiredContexts[@]}`,
# and every other surface that needs the list READS it from here -- see
# `scripts/ci-merge-group-report.sh`, `scripts/check-gated-jobs.sh` and
# `scripts/check-merge-group-report.sh`. Nothing restates the set or the number
# in prose: point at this table, or at the line the run prints, and do not write
# either down again. `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` carries that rule and
# the sites it was written from.
#
# ## The docs-only `skipped` hazard is INHERITED here, not introduced
#
# On a docs-only pull request the scope classifier answers `code=false` and the
# compiler legs report `skipped`, which a required context is read as PASSING.
# That is already true of every required context whose JOB carries the scope gate
# rather than gating its STEPS -- derive the set rather than reading one from here,
# with `awk '/^  [A-Za-z0-9_-]+:$/{j=$0} /^    if:/{print j, $0}' .github/workflows/build.yml`
# and intersect it with the table below; naming one member would read as complete,
# which is the failure this whole header exists to refuse. It is deliberate: a
# matrix job must NOT be job-gated (its per-leg contexts would never exist), and a
# non-matrix one has nothing to gain from starting a runner to do nothing.
# Promoting `clang-asan-ubsan` and `clang-tsan` adds no new KIND of instance
# of it -- said out loud so the next reader does not meet it here and file it as
# a regression this change introduced (#629's acceptance, clause 4).
#
# THE MARKER BELOW IS LOAD-BEARING and `check-required-context-table.sh` enforces
# it. Four files in this tree declare `RequiredContexts=(` and three of them are
# self-test fixtures, so a reader that finds the array by searching for its name
# has a one-in-four chance of landing here -- and the 11-row fixture in
# `check-merge-group-report.sh` is a strict SUBSET whose every row is a real
# context, which is the shape that reports "11 of 11 passed" and trips nothing
# (#1360). This is the copy everything reads; the marker says so at the
# declaration, where a searcher arrives.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The binding table: every OTHER context these workflows can produce, and why it
# does not gate a merge.
#
# ## The gap this closes
#
# #408 recorded that `clang-tsan` runs, is proven live by its own canary, and
# could not block a merge -- and said the answer was not to add one row to the
# ruleset, because "the same question applies to every other non-required leg"
# and deciding one in isolation leaves the gap in seven places. #629 was the
# same ticket for `clang-asan-ubsan`, the project's ENTIRE sanitizer test run.
#
# Both are now `Binding`. What settled them was a MEASUREMENT rather than the
# cost argument their own bodies carried, which the measurement FALSIFIED:
# neither leg is on the merge queue's critical path, and the slowest leg in the
# workflow was already required. #629 carries the numbers, the window they were
# taken over and the contention they were taken under -- read them there.
#
# What this table records without a ruleset decision is which legs are binding
# and why -- so that a leg nobody has decided about is DISTINGUISHABLE from one
# somebody deliberately left unrequired. Without it they look identical: absent
# from `RequiredContexts` and absent from everywhere else.
#
# The `Binding` column remains a copy of a server-side setting, per this file's
# header, and the ruleset is still the authority. A promotion is not in force
# until an administrator adds the row there.
#
# ## The two copies were out of step, in the measured direction
#
# The ruleset went FIRST: an administrator added both rows on 2026-09-05, while
# the branch carrying this table change was still open. So the blind spot this
# file's header states -- *a context added to the ruleset and not added here is
# not caught* -- happened for real rather than hypothetically, and it is worth
# recording which cost that bought, because the two orderings have OPPOSITE ones
# and neither is free.
#
#   Ruleset first (what happened). `ci-merge-group-report.sh` READS this table.
#   Between the flip and this landing, a failing sanitizer leg inside a merge
#   group would have been classified unrequired-and-unreported and had a #684
#   issue filed for a failure the queue had already ejected the pull request
#   over -- the reporter creating the bug it was written to prevent. #629's
#   acceptance predicted exactly this, which is why it asks for the ruleset row
#   and the table row in ONE change.
#
#   Table first. A failure of either leg inside a merge group would be
#   classified *already surfaced* by a queue that never held on it: #684's
#   silence, narrowed to two jobs and to the window.
#
# Both windows are one administrator action wide, and #629 measured 132
# executions of the two jobs across the 69 most recent `Build` runs with zero
# failures -- so neither was likely to fire. That is luck about the exposure,
# not an argument that the ordering does not matter. The standing instruction is
# the `gh api` call in this file's header: **re-read the live list rather than
# inferring it from this table**, in either direction.
#
# ## Three spellings, because two collapse the distinction
#
# This is `Protocol/SurfaceRefusal.hpp`'s idiom, one layer out. There a refusal
# is `Refuse` (a rise means something), `RefuseWithoutCounter` (a rise would
# mean nothing, and why) or `RefuseUntriaged` (nobody has decided, and which
# issue will) -- because "deliberately uncounted" must not be spelled like
# "forgot". The same three states exist here:
#
#   Binding      membership in `RequiredContexts` above; the ruleset gates it.
#   NotBinding   a considered decision that this must not block a merge, with
#                the reason and, where one exists, the issue that recorded it.
#   Undecided    nobody has decided. Carries the issue that will, and the run
#                TALLIES these per issue -- which is the only thing that keeps
#                `Undecided` from becoming a synonym for `forgot`.
#
# ## And the completeness assertion, which is the load-bearing half
#
# Every context every workflow produces must appear in exactly ONE of the two
# tables. A leg added to a workflow with no row is REFUSED, because today it
# joins as unrequired with nobody told -- exactly #492's shape, a list that is
# exact about what it knows and silent about what it does not. The workflow set
# is a GLOB and never a file list, for the same reason.
#
# Note this asserts nothing about whether a verdict is RIGHT; it asserts that
# one was reached and written down. The ruleset remains the authority on
# `Binding`, and the caveat above about a copy of a server-side setting applies
# to that column unchanged.
NonBindingContexts=(
    # Decided, with the record that decided it.
    "clang-tidy-windows|Undecided|#874: it ships UNREQUIRED and CONDITIONALLY. The leg works -- it parsed 514 units on Windows and found real diagnostics -- but the tree has findings it cannot pass today, and a gate that is reliably red teaches everyone to ignore it, which disarms it as thoroughly as deleting it (the argument in tsan-canary-rate.sh, harder at 100% than at a few percent). It becomes REQUIRED when it has been green on master twice consecutively AND #874 is decided: #874 is the MSVC-STL category, which unlike the other two does not converge, so requiring this leg before that decision is requiring a gate that may never settle"

# `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` and not a bare `"${arr[@]}"`, in both places the
# non-binding table is expanded. It cannot legitimately be empty here -- these
# workflows produce far more contexts than the ruleset requires, so most of them
# must carry a row -- and the completeness check below would catch an empty one
# anyway, since every non-required context would then fail for want of a row.
# (This sentence used to state both figures, and they went stale the first time a
# context was promoted -- which is why the counts are printed at the end of the
# run and written down nowhere.)
#
# The guard is for bash 3.2, which is macOS's /bin/bash and a platform
# this check runs on from the default ctest set: there `"${arr[@]}"` on an empty
# array is an UNBOUND VARIABLE under `set -u`, so the check would die with a
# shell error rather than print the sentence it exists to print.
#
# Same caveat as the empty-glob arm above, and for the same reason it is stated
# rather than left implicit: no test on a modern bash can catch a regression of
# this, because `BASH_COMPAT=3.2` does not restore the behaviour. A reviewer who
# reads `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` as noise and simplifies it back would see every
# check stay green here and only macOS go red.

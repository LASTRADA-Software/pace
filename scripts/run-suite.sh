#
# ## Why this exists (#1212)
#
# **A test binary that CRASHES reports zero failures in every summary format
# there is**, and a mutation harness asks exactly one question -- was this
# mutation caught? -- which it answers from a failure count. So a run that died
# partway through arrives as "0 of 482 cases failed" and is scored CAUGHT:
# indistinguishable from a real result, and pointing the wrong way, toward
# believing the guard works.
#
# Crashed, not-caught and caught are three states, and the harness that surfaced
# this had two. Measured on this repository:
#
#   * a truncated JUnit document still carries failures="0" errors="0" on the
#     elements it did emit;
#   * the console reporter prints no summary line at all;
#   * ctest is the one consumer that already distinguishes them -- a crash is
#     ***Exception, not ***Failed -- which is exactly why nobody has met this
#     through ctest, and why a harness running the binary directly does.
#
# It was caught by a DENOMINATOR THAT MOVED (482 / 496 / 530), not by a verdict
# that looked wrong. A crash dying at a stable point has no tell at all.
#
# ## Neither input is sufficient alone, and the reason is arithmetic
#
# **On Catch2 3.6.0 the exit status was the failure count**, clamped at 255. So a
# run killed by SIGSEGV (128 + 11 = 139) and a run with 139 failing assertions
# produced the SAME status, and no reading of the status alone separated them.
# Catch2 3.7.1 fixed the failure code at 42, which separates those two and nothing
# else: #1211 measured the other direction too -- exits 0 / 139 / 0 / 0 / 139 / 139
# across six runs whose element counts were 551 / 507 / 551 / 551 / 518 / 518, so
# a SHORT run exited 0 at least once. Completeness does: a killed run's report
# stops mid-document.
#
# Completeness is therefore asked FIRST, and the status only refines it.
#
# ## A FIFTH state the ticket does not name, measured here
#
# A filter matching nothing exits 2 and prints "No tests ran" -- and to a
# count-reader that is another zero. It is the mutation harness's own likeliest
# failure: an anchor that has stopped matching, a renamed tag, a typo in a spec.
# So selected-nothing is its own outcome and never a pass.
#
# ## The retry, and why it is named
#
# A crash is retried, because a harness that scores one has measured nothing --
# and the retry is REPORTED with its count, since a retry that hides an
# instrument's own failures is how this class of defect stays invisible. Only
# crashed is retried, never failed.
#
# ## Not a stderr grep
#
# Deliberately no malloc() pattern. That is the signature the crash in #1211
# happens to have, and the next one aborts somewhere else. The verdict comes from
# the three inputs below and from nothing the subject chooses to print.

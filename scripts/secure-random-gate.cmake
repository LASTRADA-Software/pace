# Refuse to report green unless separate PROCESSES draw separate handshake nonces.
#
# ## Why processes, and why a gate rather than a Catch2 case
#
# #1527: nonces came from an engine seeded ONCE per process from `std::random_device`, which
# on the host #1507 was measured on answers zero for 57% of draws. Every process that seeded
# zero drew the SAME stream -- and within any one process that stream never repeats, so every
# in-process "two nonces differ" case passed on the broken build. The property that failed is
# across processes, so it is asked of processes: `secure-random-probe --source=os` is run
# `Processes` times, `PerProcess` nonces each, and any nonce seen twice is refused.
#
# ## The control, run FIRST
#
# A repeat detector nobody has watched refuse is not known to work, and a green verdict from a
# broken one is indistinguishable from a sound generator. So before the real run, the probe's
# `seeded-engine` source -- the pre-#1527 construction, seeded with the zero the broken host
# produced, drawn through the real `DrawNonce` -- is run in TWO processes, and the same
# detector must report every one of the second's nonces as a repeat. Anything else refuses.
#
# ## Four outcomes, kept apart
#
#   * a probe run did not exit 0, or printed the wrong number of nonces -> nothing measured, FAIL
#   * the control did not repeat                                       -> the detector is blind, FAIL
#   * the OS source repeated, or drew an all-zero nonce                -> the defect, FAIL
#   * the control repeated and the OS source did not                   -> PASS
#
# ## How likely a false red is, stated rather than implied
#
# With a sound generator, the chance that any two of the `Processes x PerProcess` nonces
# collide is at most (n choose 2) / 2^256 -- below 2^-243 for the 128 drawn here -- and an
# all-zero nonce is 2^-256 per draw. Neither is a flake budget; both are zero for any purpose.
#
# Reports failure by printing `CMake Error`, the contract every `cmake -P` check here is
# registered under -- `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` holds the one spelling of the pattern.
#
# Usage:

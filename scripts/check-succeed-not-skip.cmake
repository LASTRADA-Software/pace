# A Catch2 case that could not RUN its check must not report a PASS.
#
# `SUCCEED("...")` records a passing assertion. Where a case bails out because its
# environment could not be arranged -- no loopback listener, no IPv6 stack, no symlink
# privilege, running as root -- that is a green result for a property nothing
# established ([#685](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/685)).
#
# It is the converse of [#499](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/499),
# and the insidious direction. A false RED gets investigated; a false GREEN is believed,
# and it fires exactly where coverage is already thinnest -- a constrained runner, a
# host without IPv6, a Windows agent without the symlink privilege. Those are the runs
# where a green is least justified and most trusted.
#
# ## Why this is a check and not a comment
#
# The idiom spread by IMITATION. `src/apps/pace-cc/DirectManifest_test.cpp` carried
# it under a comment that explained, correctly, that the rule being demonstrated is
# unconditional -- and the next test written was copied from it, comment and all. A
# comment that was already right did not stop the copy, so a comment is not the fix.
#
# ## What it can and cannot see
#
# Two signals, and neither is a judgement about whether the case "really ran" -- nothing
# lexical can decide that:
#
#   * **The bail-out shape.** A `SUCCEED` whose next statement is `return;` is leaving
#     the case early -- on the following line, or on its own line, since
#     `if (!ready) { SUCCEED("x"); return; }` is the same defect written in one. Every
#     one of the twenty-one sites #685 converted had it, and no legitimate site in this
#     tree does: a `SUCCEED` that means "the case ran and there was nothing to assert"
#     is the LAST thing in the case and needs no return.
#   * **Skip vocabulary in the message.** A message saying the check could not be
#     performed is the author telling you which state this is. The table below is data,
#     one row per phrase with the reading that makes it a skip.
#
# A `SUCCEED` that bails out silently, with a message in none of that vocabulary and no
# `return`, is invisible here. That is a real limit and is stated rather than papered
# over: this check closes the door the defect actually came through, and
# `.agent/rules/testing.md` carries the rule for the rest.
#
# `SUCCEED()` with no message at all is fine -- `Ranges_test.cpp` uses it after a block
# of `static_assert`s, which is a case that ran and had nothing left to assert.
#
# ## Inconclusive is refused, not passed
#
# A `SUCCEED(` this script cannot read to a closing parenthesis on one line is reported
# as its own outcome. It is not evidence of anything, and the direction this project
# keeps getting wrong is scoring "could not determine" as "fine".
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`: it reads files, compares strings and reports. See
# `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports failure through its
# OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-succeed-not-skip.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

# A `cmake -P` script has no project, so every policy starts unset. Stated as a minimum
# version so the whole set of checks moves together.

# Read and split by hand rather than with `file(STRINGS)`, which returns a LIST: a line
# containing a semicolon becomes two elements and every line number after it drifts.
# Lines are WALKED, never assembled into a CMake list, and that is the whole point.
#
# A list cannot carry a line ending in a backslash. Measured on CMake 3.28.3: the value
# `one\\;two` -- an ESCAPED backslash followed by a separator -- expands to ONE element,
# because a `;` preceded by any backslash is read as escaped whether or not that
# backslash was itself escaped. So no ordering of escapes can place a separator after
# such a line. The reader here used to escape `\` and `;` and split on newlines, and its
# own comment claimed that escaping stopped a line ending in a backslash merging with
# the next -- which is the one case it does not stop.
#
# A merged element begins with whatever the EARLIER line began with, so a `//` swallows
# the real code below it and every line number after it drifts. That is a false GREEN,
# which is the direction nobody investigates.
#
# Live exposure was ZERO when this was repaired: no file in this check's corpus of 229
# test sources ends a line with a backslash. So this closes a latent hazard rather than
# fixing an observed failure -- and it is one file away, since `dist-compile-e2e.sh` has
# 152 such lines and `local-gate.sh` 101. A check reading `scripts/*.sh` through the old
# idiom would have met it on its first file.
#
# `[` and `]` are still replaced with a space. With no list they can no longer merge
# anything, so this is now purely about what the check SEES -- and changing that is a
# different decision from repairing the reader, taken separately or not at all.
# Consolidating the copies of this idiom is #495, not this ticket.

# `SUCCEED` reddens a check about OUR code on a change that is not ours. Measured:
# every one of this repository's 236 own `*_test.cpp` files is under `src/`, so the

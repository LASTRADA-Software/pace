# The notifier for #684 is wired up, and it decides correctly.
#
# Usage:  scripts/check-merge-group-report.sh [--self-test]
#
#   (no arguments)  assert the SHAPE of `.github/workflows/merge-group-report.yml`
#                   and of the two scripts it drives.
#   --self-test     drive `scripts/ci-merge-group-report.sh` against staged job
#                   records -- including three captured from real failing
#                   merge-group runs -- and `scripts/ci-report-issue.sh` against
#                   a stub `gh`.
#
# ## Why the shape is asserted rather than the behaviour
#
# `workflow_run` only ever runs the copy of a workflow file that is on the
# DEFAULT branch. So nothing on a pull request exercises this notifier, and its
# first run anywhere is after it merges -- the same "cannot be demonstrated
# before the fact" that `check-merge-queue-contexts.sh` records about
# `merge_group`, arriving one door further out.
#
# The answer is the same one this tree reaches for whenever an instrument cannot
# be tested without paying for what it measures: split the DECISION out and test
# that exhaustively, leave acquisition as thin as it can be, and assert the
# wiring statically so it cannot be removed silently. `local-gate.sh`'s pure
# renderer and `node-scratch-isolation-e2e`'s readings record are the same move.
#
# ## The one claim here that was NOT measured
#
# That `workflow_run` fires at all for a run whose own event was `merge_group`.
# GitHub's documentation says the event fires on any workflow run completing and
# excludes only runs triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN`; a merge queue dispatches as
# `github-merge-queue[bot]`, not as a workflow token. That is REASONED, not
# measured, and it cannot be measured from a branch.
#
# What makes it self-revealing rather than a silent bet is that the workflow
# carries no `branches:` filter: it therefore fires on ordinary pull-request
# `Build` runs too and prints "event is 'pull_request', not merge_group". So from
# the first run after it merges, "it never fires" and "it fires and has nothing
# to say" are two visible states rather than one indistinguishable silence. That
# is the four-states rule applied to the one thing here that could not be proven.
#
# ## bash 3.2
#
# Registered in the default ctest set, so it runs on macOS's 2007 `/bin/bash`.
# No `mapfile`, no `declare -A`, no `${var^^}`.

# A COMMENT is not a setting. Every rule below reads the workflow with full-line

# made two rules fire against a correct workflow the first time this ran.
#
# That is the second instance of one mistake in this branch: `check-gated-jobs.sh`
# attributed its own explanatory comment to a step and reported that step twice.
# A rule satisfied -- or refused -- by prose is a rule that passes with the code
# deleted, so both directions matter and both are self-tested.

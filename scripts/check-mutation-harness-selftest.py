"""Drive `scripts/mutation-harness.py` against staged trees, one case per outcome.

A guard nobody has watched refuse is not a guard, and a guard nobody has watched
ACCEPT is not known to work (#1031, which sat for two days failing CLOSED and
unconditionally while reading like a bad branch). Both directions are here.

## The case this file exists for

`stale-binary` is #1252's clause 2, which the ticket calls the whole ticket:
**the restore-rebuild rule needs a test that FAILS when the rebuild is deleted.**
A harness whose rebuild can be removed with nothing noticing has the defect by
construction, and a structural claim ("the call is on line N") is not that test.

It is driven by DELETING the post-restore rebuild from a COPY of the harness with
a plain textual edit, asserting the anchor matched exactly once, and requiring the
copy to ABORT naming the stale binary. Its negative control (`stale-binary-ctl`)
runs the UNMODIFIED harness over the same staged tree and requires a clean pass --
without it, "the harness aborts when the rebuild is deleted" and "the harness
aborts on this tree" are one passing test.

**The edit is made by this file directly and NOT by the harness.** Testing the
mutation harness with the mutation harness would let a defect vouch for itself:
the tool's subject here is tools, and the one arrangement that cannot work is the
tool measuring itself.

## Why the staged subject is not C++

The harness must be exercised over a subject that is COMPILED -- one whose binary
can go stale -- and a real compiler in a hygiene check would make this reachable
only where a full build is already running, which is the population it is not
for (#257's argument for `tidy-sweep.sh`'s canary). So the staged tree carries a
two-line "compiler" that derives a binary from a source, and a "test" that reads
the BINARY and never the source. That is the entire property that matters: a
restore without a rebuild leaves the previous mutant in the artefact the verdict
is read from. Everything else about a compiler is irrelevant to it.

Both are Python invoked through `sys.executable`, so this file spawns no shell and
inherits none of the platform's quoting.

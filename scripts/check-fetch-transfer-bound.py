"""Watches the dependency-fetch transfer bound (#526) actually refuse a stall.

The bound, the measurements behind it and the reasoning for its numbers are in
`cmake/FetchTransferBound.cmake`, which is the one place they are stated. This
file is what shows the bound firing, because a guard nobody has watched refuse
is not a guard -- and the fix applied by hand on the night of the wedges was
never once exercised, which is exactly the gap this closes.

WHAT IT PROVES, precisely, because the distinction matters when this is cited:

  * The subject can be made to hang.  Each transport is run against the stall
    with its bound REMOVED and must still be running when the control window
    ends.  Without this the refusals below would prove nothing: a stall that
    ends on its own is refused by everything.
  * Each transport refuses that same stall once the bound is applied, at the
    rate floor this tree ships, and says so in words naming the transfer.
  * This tree WIRES the bound: the seam is reached before anything is fetched,
    and no download in the tree is left unbounded.  A bound nothing includes is
    a file, not a guard.

  * NOT the shipped WINDOW.  By default the window is compressed (``--window``)
    so this stays a seconds-long default-set test rather than a four-minute one.
    What is compressed is how long git and CMake count before giving up; the
    rate floor, the mechanism, the delivery channel and the wiring are all the
    shipped ones.  Pass ``--full`` to run it at the shipped window instead --
    that takes a little over ``GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_TIME`` and is how the shipped
    number itself gets watched.  The window each run exercised is PRINTED, so a
    later citation cannot confuse the two figures.

The stall is a listener that accepts a connection and then answers nothing.
That is the observed shape rather than a convenient approximation: the wedged
configures had an ESTABLISHED connection which had delivered zero bytes, which
is why a refusal to connect, a reset and a closed socket are all the wrong
stand-in -- every one of those ends by itself.

Python rather than the usual .sh/.ps1 pair because this needs a listening
socket and process-tree control, which POSIX shell cannot express at all; a
shell version would be a Windows-only implementation with a POSIX stub.

    A slow machine and a wedged bound are fixed in different places, so a wait that
    ran out has to say which it met. Before #1469 this had two answers and gave the
    confident one: `Windows-cl-debug` reported "the bound is not reaching it" about
    git on an attempt where the SIBLING leg refused after 35.1s against a 5s window
    -- a host running about 7x slow -- and passed on a re-run at the same commit.
    That message sends whoever reads it to `cmake/FetchTransferBound.cmake` and to
    git's `http.lowSpeedTime`, neither of which was involved.

    **The evidence is already in hand: a sibling's own refusal time is a reading of
    how slow the host is.** A leg refusing at `seconds` against `window` has
    demonstrated that this host needs `seconds - window` of overhead to notice and
    act. The phase hands every leg `patience - window` of slack for that. So:

    - no leg ended at all -> there is no speed reading, and that is its own reason to
      be inconclusive rather than a reason to believe the fastest explanation;
    - a leg that DID end consumed the whole slack -> a leg exactly that slow could not
      have ended inside `patience`, so a sibling that did not tells us nothing;
    - otherwise the host was demonstrably fast enough, and a non-ending leg is a bound
      that is not reaching its transport.

    **This rule has no constant, deliberately.** The comparison is the phase's own
    slack against a measurement the phase itself produced, so there is no number to
    raise -- and raising one is what restores the original wrong answer by the front
    door, since the next loaded runner is slower still.

    What it does NOT cover, said here so the next reader does not over-apply it: a host
    slow enough to eat only PART of the slack still yields `unreachable-bound`. Closing
    that gap needs a fraction-of-slack constant, which is the thing this avoids.

    @param readings A `BoundedReading` per leg of one phase.
    @param window The silence window in force, in seconds.
    @param patience The phase's deadline, in seconds.

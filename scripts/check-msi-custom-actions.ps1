# Every custom action of the MSI, run the way Windows Installer runs it -- without installing.
#
# A type 34 action (Directory + ExeCommand) is a command line Windows Installer FORMATS and then
# starts with CreateProcess, IN its Directory. Nothing in the WiX build looks at either half: a
# quote PowerShell parses differently, a `[` the formatter swallows, or a working directory that
# does not exist when the action runs all build a package that fails only on a Windows runner,
# minutes into its slowest job. The last one did: PaceAwaitServiceExit was started in
# INSTALL_ROOT before InstallFiles, after an upgrade from 0.3.0 had removed that directory, so the
# process was never created and the upgrade failed in under 100 ms (round 5).
#
# So, per action, from packaging/windows/service-actions.xml:
#   1. its PHASE, from the sequence: before InstallFiles the install root may not exist (an
#      upgrade's old product has just removed it), after it the root does (`AnchorPhases`);
#   2. its target, formatted as Windows Installer formats it ([Property], [\x] escapes);
#   3. its working directory, from its Directory in that phase -- an action that would be started
#      in a directory that does not exist is a FAILURE, whatever its command;
#   4. a PowerShell body is parsed by Windows PowerShell 5.1, which is what the action runs;
#   5. the actions that only READ (`RunnableActions`) are started for real, in the directory they
#      would have, and must exit 0 over a root no process runs from -- and, the control that keeps
#      that 0 honest, 1460 while a process DOES run from it, or from the directory the OLD
#      registrations name (R4-1: a 0.3.0 in a custom directory is upgraded into the default root);
#   6. Windows Installer's own rule for RemoveExistingProducts scheduled after InstallInitialize
#      (as MajorUpgrade's afterInstallInitialize does): NO action that writes to the execution
#      script -- deferred, rollback or commit -- may come before it, or the package is refused at
#      once with Error 2613 (round 7, when round 6 had put the registration copies there);
#   7. the key rollback state lives in -- read off PaceClearRollbackState, and the one key
#      every action naming rollback state uses -- is covered by NO registry element of the package:
#      one the package owns is deleted by an uninstall, and the state must outlive a failed
#      transaction's rollback until its last step (#8). It reads the
#      fragment ONLY, and fails OPEN for a registry element CPack's generated sources add;
#   8. that key is deleted where nothing else deletes it -- last in a failed transaction's
#      rollback, after every action that reads it, and on an uninstall that is not an upgrade's;
#   9. every action that can FAIL the transaction (in the script, Return="check") comes after
#      both exact restores, so its failure rolls BOTH services back: an upgrade from 0.3.0 has no
#      other way back, since 0.3.0's uninstall deleted them and 0.3.0 ships no rollback. The
#      window from RemoveExistingProducts through WriteRegistryValues cannot be covered, and the
#      one checked action of ours in it is a stated residual (`ChecksBeforeTheRestores`);
#  10. a rollback action that STARTS a service is scheduled before InstallFiles, so the rollback,
#      which runs in reverse, starts it only after InstallFiles' rollback restored the files. That
#      holds for a maintenance transaction; in an upgrade the old files return only with
#      RemoveExistingProducts' rollback, after the restarts, and no mark is written there to start
#      anything (StopServices has stopped both services first);
#  11. the rollback state is discarded only once the transaction has SUCCEEDED: every action that
#      deletes it is a commit action, a rollback action, or a stated deferred row -- and at least one
#      SCHEDULED commit action does, so the step cannot pass with the discard gone. The deleters are
#      found by ONE spelling, and the step fails OPEN for any other (stated at the step);
#  12. a MAINTENANCE transaction resolves INSTALL_ROOT from the product's OWN install location:
#      while any scheduled action a maintenance transaction can run names INSTALL_ROOT, the fragment
#      sets it, when Installed, before CostFinalize, from a RegistrySearch of
#      Uninstall\[ProductCode]'s InstallLocation. CPack resolves it only on an upgrade, and an
#      uninstall of a custom root ran the default root's binary and left its service registered;
#  13. Windows Installer's Restart Manager takes no part in a transaction: ONE Property row sets
#      MSIRESTARTMANAGERCONTROL to "Disable", and nothing else sets it. Restart Manager restarts a
#      service the table left stopped, and its shutdown, ahead of StopServices, cost the
#      ServiceControl rows their rollback start;
#  14. PaceDisableForNode disables only a registration that EXISTS: its command is started for
#      real with every service name it spells swapped for one nothing registers, and must exit 0;
#      and, the control that keeps that 0 honest, with the QUERY naming a service every host has and
#      the disable still naming the absent one, it must exit 1060 -- a disable that fails on a
#      service that is there fails the action. Neither run can change a service: the only one either
#      would configure does not exist.
# Every other action changes a service, the registry or the firewall, and is never started here.
#
# Usage: pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/check-msi-custom-actions.ps1 -SourceDir <repository root>
# Exit 0 when every action passes; non-zero, naming each failure, otherwise.

#
# `RequiredContexts` agrees with the ruleset the SERVER actually enforces (#1562).
#
# THE GAP. `scripts/check-merge-queue-contexts.sh` carries the tree's statement of which
# contexts gate a merge, and every check around it reconciles that table against the
# WORKFLOWS -- can each context be produced, does each have a `merge_group` leg, does a
# skipped job still report. Nothing reconciled it against the RULESET, which is the only
# thing that actually blocks a merge. The table and the server could disagree
# indefinitely and every check would stay green, because each was correct about its own
# side.
#
# They do disagree today, which is what makes this worth having rather than a hypothesis.
#
# BOTH DIRECTIONS, and they are different failures:
#
#   in the TABLE, not in the RULESET   the tree believes a context gates and it does
#                                      not. Everything downstream -- the queue-leg
#                                      check, `ci-pr-required.sh`'s blocking list --
#                                      reasons about a gate that is not there. This is
#                                      the UNSAFE direction and it is the one that is
#                                      live.
#   in the RULESET, not in the TABLE   the server blocks on something the tree has
#                                      never heard of, so no check asserts it can
#                                      report. That is the never-arrives failure: a
#                                      required context nothing produces leaves a
#                                      queued pull request waiting forever.
#
# FAIL CLOSED, because an unreachable API and an agreeing set are not the same green.
# Measured, so the arms are drawn from the tool rather than from a guess about it:
#
#   normal                       exit 0, a non-empty context list
#   --jq matched nothing         exit 0, EMPTY stdout  -- reachable on a HEALTHY API
#                                (wrong branch, rule removed). REFUSED, not passed.
#   HTTP error (401, 404, 403)   exit 1, and the raw JSON error lands on STDOUT even
#                                though `--jq` was given, so a caller that does not
#                                check `$?` gets a string that is neither empty nor a
#                                context list. REFUSED.
#   not authenticated            exit 4, empty stdout. UNAVAILABLE -> SKIP.
#   `gh` not installed           exit 127. UNAVAILABLE -> SKIP.
#
# The last two are the instrument being absent rather than a verdict about the tree, so
# they exit 77 and SAY so. Anything neither 0 nor 1 is the instrument, not the subject.
#
# WHICH SIDE EACH NAME CAME FROM is printed for every finding, so a future divergence
# names a DIRECTION rather than a count -- "13 vs 14" tells nobody which way to look.

# or dropped from the table -- and it is the repository owner's to take. This check
# cannot take it by refusing, and it must not silently accept it either, so the
# divergence is recorded WITH its issue and every OTHER divergence is refused.
#
# A row that has stopped describing a real divergence is refused as STALE, which is what
# makes this expire rather than accumulate: resolving #1562 in either direction turns
# this row red until it is deleted, so deleting it is part of closing the ticket.

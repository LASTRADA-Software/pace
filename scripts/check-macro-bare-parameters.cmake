cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.28)
#
# A `macro()` parameter read as a BARE name inside `if()` is a literal string, so the
# branch is dead (#1216).
#
# ## The mechanism, in one line
#
# A macro's parameters are TEXT. The body is substituted before it runs, so `${want}`
# becomes the argument and a bare `want` is left standing as the four characters
# `want`. `if(want STREQUAL "want-pass")` therefore compares `want` against
# `want-pass` and is false forever. Inside a `function()` the identical line WORKS,
# because a function's parameters are real variables.
#
# ## Why it is worth a check rather than a rule
#
# Three properties, and the third is what makes a check the only remedy:
#
#   * It is silent in both directions. CMake does not warn, and the dead branch does
#     not fail -- it falls through to whatever comes next, which in a test harness is
#     the weaker assertion.
#   * It reads as correct. The two constructs are one keyword apart.
#   * It CONCENTRATES in harnesses. A macro is chosen over a function precisely when
#     the body must set variables in the caller's scope, which is what a per-case test
#     harness does -- so the construct lands disproportionately in the code whose job
#     is to decide verdicts.
#
# The instance that produced this check cost exactly that: `pace_case` in
# `check-corrupt-store-diagnostics-selftest.cmake` had BOTH verdict arms dead, so nine
# cases fell through to a substring check and the two `want-pass` cases -- which pass
# an empty substring -- asserted nothing at all.
#
# ## What it refuses, and what it must NOT
#
# Refused: a bare parameter name in the condition of an `if()`, `elseif()` or
# `while()` inside the `macro()` that declares it.
#
# Not refused: `${param}` and `"${param}"`, which are correct and are what the fix
# looks like; the same shape inside a `function()`, where it works; and a name that
# merely CONTAINS a parameter name, since the match is on whole words.
#
# ## The one legitimate shape this cannot tell apart, and the way out
#
# A macro parameter whose name is ALSO a variable the body sets -- `macro(f status)`
# whose body runs an `execute_process(... RESULT_VARIABLE status)` and then reads
# `if(status EQUAL 0)` -- is reading the VARIABLE, correctly, and this check cannot
# see the difference: at the point of the `if()` both spellings are the same six
# characters. No such site exists in this tree today, and a checker that refused one
# would be refusing correct code.
#
# So there is a marker, and it carries a REASON:
#
#     # macro-bare-parameter: <why this name is a variable here, not the parameter>
#
# in the comment block immediately above the line. The count of markers is PRINTED on
# every run, because a marker nobody reads would spell "forgot" in the vocabulary of
# "decided" -- and a marker with no reason after it is refused outright.
#
# ## Scope, stated rather than left to be inferred
#
# `scripts/` and everything under it. The other two candidate scopes were MEASURED at
# d911b33e rather than assumed, by this check's own rule and again by
# `git grep -c '^macro('` as a second construction: `cmake/**/*.cmake` holds 13 files
# and **0 macro definitions**, and the 13 tracked `CMakeLists.txt` files hold **0**.
# So the shape cannot occur there today -- which is a stronger answer than "no
# violations found", because there is nothing there to violate. Widening the glob when
# a macro first appears in either is a one-line change.
#
# ## Why this file cannot report itself
#
# It defines no `macro()`, so its own walk never enters a macro body and the example
# text in these comments is never examined. That is immunity by construction rather
# than an exclusion, which is the same reason the walk below builds no CMake list: a
# list-free `FIND`/`SUBSTRING` walk cannot have an unbalanced `[` in a comment merge
# two lines and move a reported line number, and the shell dispatch shapes some of
# these files carry ARE brackets.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-macro-bare-parameters.cmake
#
# Exit codes: whatever CMake gives it. The verdict is read from the OUTPUT, because
# that is the rule every check here is registered under.

# Build a REAL target through `pace-cc` and run that target's own tests.
#
# ## Why this exists when two launcher fixtures already do
#
# `compile-cache-e2e.sh` and the `pace-cc smoke` job prove the launcher RUNS
# and produces AN object. Neither proves it is the RIGHT object, because both
# compile synthetic single files and neither ever executes what came out. That is
# the only shape that catches a launcher handing back an object which does not
# match the source tree — and it stopped being theoretical with #319, where a
# cache-backed build of a test binary segfaulted and the same commit built with
# `-DUSE_COMPILER_CACHE=OFF` passed. Nothing in CI could have reported it.
#
# So: compile a target with many translation units and real argument diversity,
# twice, and RUN it.
#
# ## The three builds, and why each one is needed
#
#   control  `-DUSE_COMPILER_CACHE=OFF`. The reference. Says the source is good
#            and the suite passes when no launcher is involved at all.
#   cold     launcher on, empty cache. Every unit MISSES, so every object is
#            really compiled — and stored.
#   warm     launcher on, same cache. Every unit HITS, so every object is
#            REPLAYED. This is the build under test; replay is where a wrong
#            object comes from, and a job that only builds cold replays nothing.
#
# The objects are byte-compared between **cold and warm**, not between control
# and warm, and that is deliberate rather than lazy: `CompileCache.cmake` sets
# `CMAKE_DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS` and `CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES OFF` when a
# launcher is active, so a cache-on and a cache-off build are configured
# differently and their objects legitimately differ. Cold against warm is the
# only apples-to-apples comparison available, and it is the one that matters.
# Control participates at the level it can: its suite result must agree.
#
# ## What makes a green run mean something
#
# Two guards, and without either the whole fixture is decorative:
#
#   - the cold build must be observed using the launcher at all (`LAUNCHER = ` in
#     `build.ninja`, the same check the standing `-DUSE_COMPILER_CACHE=OFF` rule
#     is verified by from the other side);
#   - the warm build must be observed HITTING. A warm build that missed
#     everything compiles correctly, passes every assertion below, and has
#     replayed nothing. That is this fixture's own "did the tool actually run"
#     failure, and it is checked by counting.
#
# `--canary` proves the fixture bites: it puts a deliberately wrong object into
# the replayed build and requires the suite to go red. A verifier nobody has seen
# fail is worth nothing.

# `fail` and `e2e_note` come from here, along with the TERM trap `e2e_begin`
# installs. This fixture kept private copies of both until #813: the argument
# for that was that it draws no port (ctest hands it one) and polls no HTTP
# surface, so it would be sourcing a 1900-line library to reach one three-word
# function -- and converting a fixture that builds three CMake trees cannot be
# verified in the session that makes the change.
#
# What decided it the other way is not the duplication. It is that a private
# copy of a shared helper is an EXEMPTION in `check-e2e-helpers.sh`'s scan, and
# an exemption is blind to the SECOND divergence as well as the first: the row
# naming this file cost that scan the ability to see any further drift in this
# `fail`, which is precisely where #627's silently-inert `BASHPID` guard sat for
# two tickets with a comment above it arguing it was correct. The copies were
# correct when the row was written; the scan could not have told anybody when
# they stopped being.
#
# The reasoning that used to live here -- why a stop is signalled
# UNCONDITIONALLY rather than guarded on `BASHPID`, which is bash 4.0+ and
# silently unset on macOS's 3.2 -- is `fail`'s in `lib/e2e-common.sh`, reached
# from the same argument and exercised by the self-test in all three contexts
# (top level, `( ... )` and `$( ... )`). This fixture raises `fail` from inside
# a subshell: the control build runs in one so it can unset the launcher
# environment without disturbing the two builds after it.

# `skip` stays private, and the library grows no equivalent for it here. Every
# fixture under `scripts/` spells its own `SKIP=77` and its own message, because
# 77 is a CONTRACT WITH THE CALLER rather than a fact about the library.
#
# It now has TWO callers and they read the same number differently, which is the
# reason to keep it spelled here rather than one indirection away. `build.yml`'s
# "A real target, replayed from cache" step turns 77 into `::error::replay E2E
# skipped, nothing verified` -- in CI a skip is a failure, because the whole point
# of that leg is that it ran. The `launcher-replay-e2e` ctest registration reads
# the same 77 through `SKIP_RETURN_CODE` and reports Skipped, because on a
# developer's machine the prerequisites genuinely may not be there.
#
# Until #1254 there was one caller and no registration at all, so
# `ctest -R launcher-replay-e2e` selected nothing and exited 0 -- while AGENT.md
# and two rules files quoted this fixture as a live instrument. A name that
# selects nothing is the worst shape a check can have: it answers, it answers
# green, and it is not there.

# `assertions` is the needle because it is in both shapes and in the failing one

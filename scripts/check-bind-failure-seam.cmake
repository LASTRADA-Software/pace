# Every surface the compile node opens reaches its bind-failure verdict through
# `JudgeBindFailure`, and no opener decides one itself.
#
# `NodeSurfaceTable()` carries a `BindFailurePolicy` column and a sentence saying why
# ([#352](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/352)), and a
# `static_assert` refuses a row that omits either. That guard is exact about the
# TABLE and says nothing about the CODE: a fifth opener can be written tomorrow that
# binds a port and answers
#
#     return std::unexpected { std::format("cannot bind {}: {}", where, why) };
#
# which compiles, links, passes every test, and puts the verdict back in the place
# the ticket was filed about. The row would still be there, still stating a policy,
# and nothing would read it. That is the same shape as the counter defect
# `check-worker-refusals-counted.cmake` exists for -- a rule the type system enforces
# on one side of a seam and not on the other -- so this is deliberately built the
# same way, down to the whole-file prefilter and the reason each exclusion carries.
#
# ## What is scanned, and what is not
#
# `src/apps/pace-node/` only. The daemon binds too --
# `src/apps/pace-kv/main.cpp` and `src/Pace/Server/ReactorServerLoop.cpp`
# each decide a bind failure inline -- and they are deliberately NOT covered here:
# `BindFailurePolicy` lives in the node's own `NodeSurfaces.hpp`, which the library
# and the daemon cannot include. Widening this scan without first moving the seam
# would report violations nobody can fix, so the boundary is stated rather than
# discovered.
#
# ## Why a per-FILE requirement rather than a per-SITE one
#
# A bind and the verdict it produces are usually several statements apart, often in
# a different function of the same file -- `NodeFrameSurface::Bind` binds and
# `StartNodeSurfaceOrExplain` judges. Pairing them mechanically would need to
# understand control flow, and a checker that guesses at that reports confident
# nonsense on the first opener written in a shape it did not anticipate.
#
# So the requirement is the one that can be checked exactly: a file that calls a
# bind primitive must also name `JudgeBindFailure`. That cannot prove a particular
# failure path goes through the seam, and it does not claim to. What it does close
# is the case this ticket is about -- a whole opener written without the seam ever
# being reached -- which is the only way the four current ones went wrong.
#
# ## The two ways this check can be wrong about itself
#
# Both are failures rather than silences, because a scan that finds nothing looks
# exactly like a tree with nothing to find (#492).
#
#   - **The scan matched nothing.** No files, no `JudgeBindFailure` anywhere, or a
#     bind primitive that appears in no file at all -- the last being what a rename
#     looks like, after which this check goes on passing while guarding nothing.
#   - **A file could not be read.** Distinguished from a violation and escalated to
#     a failure, never counted as compliant, for `ci-scope.sh`'s reason: every way of
#     not knowing resolves to the answer that fails closed.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`: it reads files, compares strings and reports. See
# `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports failure through its
# OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-bind-failure-seam.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

# A `cmake -P` script has no project, so every policy starts unset and CMP0057
# (`if(... IN_LIST ...)`) is one of them -- unset, the operator is an unknown
# argument and the script errors out rather than answering. Stated as a minimum
# version so the whole set moves together with the project's own.

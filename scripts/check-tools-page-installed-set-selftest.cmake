# `tools-page-installed-set` must be SEEN to refuse each thing it claims to refuse,
# and seen to stay QUIET on the shapes that are merely awkward.
#
# The check exists because the Tools page is hand-written prose that no compiler
# reads. This fixture exists because the CHECK is hand-written CMake that nothing
# else reads either, and a check nobody has watched refuse is not a check -- it is
# decoration that reports green on the day it stops working.
#
# The mutations are applied to a SYNTHESISED tree, never to the tree under test, so
# there is no revert step and nothing can be left behind. Each case asserts its
# mutation actually LANDED before any verdict is drawn from it: a mutation that did
# not apply satisfies a `must not appear` needle perfectly and reports the guard as
# biting when nothing was staged.
#
# The BASELINE is the load-bearing case. Every refusal below is evidence only if the
# unmutated tree passes -- otherwise each case is merely observing the same
# pre-existing failure, and would go on passing if the rule it names were deleted.
#
# ## The three bracket arms
#
# `docs/tools/index.md` is markdown: `[` and `]` everywhere, in links and tables. A
# reader that splits lines into a CMake list merges elements at every unbalanced
# bracket, which is how `net-boundary` passed over a real cross-boundary include and
# `psk-signing-seam` (retired at #178) counted 15 calls as 14 -- both SILENTLY, both green.
#
# A clean-tree bracket injection cannot see that. On a clean tree everything a merged
# element swallows is something the check had nothing to say about, so nothing changes
# and the check looks fine (#518 classified `net-boundary` as merely PARTIAL for exactly
# this reason). So there are three arms, and the third is not decoration:
#
#   * `documented not installed` -- the violation alone, proving the check finds it;
#   * `violation hidden behind a bracket` -- the same violation with an unbalanced `[`
#     on the line above, proving a bracket cannot swallow it;
#   * `bracket with no violation` -- the bracket alone, proving the check does not
#     REFUSE on a bracket. Without this last one, a check that rejected every bracket
#     would pass the middle arm for the wrong reason.
#
# A semicolon arm rides alongside for the same reason: `;` is CMake's list separator,
# and a code span containing one is ordinary markdown.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check
# reports failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DFASTCACHED_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-tools-page-installed-set-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

The project ships three executables, and these are all of them: every target
carrying an `install()` rule appears below.

## `pace-kv` — the cache daemon

The server. Start here: [Quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart.md).

## `pace-cc` — the compiler launcher

A drop-in replacement for [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) and
[sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache).

Full reference: [pace-cc](pace-cc.md).

## `pace-node` — the compile worker

Takes translation units that missed the cache and compiles them.

Full reference: [pace-node](pace-node.md).

## Which do I want?

| Goal | Use |
|------|-----|
| Speed up compiles | `pace-cc` + a `pace-kv` daemon |
| A memcached- or Redis-compatible cache | `pace-kv` alone |

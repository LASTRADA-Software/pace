# `node-surface-docs` must be SEEN to refuse each thing it claims to refuse, and

#
# The check exists because the operator port documentation is hand-written prose
# that no compiler reads. This fixture exists because the CHECK is hand-written
# CMake that nothing else reads either, and four of its rules turned out not to
# implement what their own comments said:
#
#   * a numeric count claim (`6-surface table`) fell through the residue rule's
#     character class and was accepted in silence, while the comment beside the
#     number-word table said it was refused as unclassified;
#   * the residue rule took the LEFTMOST match, so an earlier `node surface`
#     masked any numeric claim later in the same sentence;
#   * a fence that merely INVOKES `--print-surfaces` without pasting output was
#     held to the whole table, reporting four missing surfaces for a page that
#     claimed nothing;
#   * only `flags[0]` was extracted, leaving the `discovery` row's second flag
#     outside the guard the flag rule exists to be.
#
# Every one of those was reachable only by mutating the tree. None was visible in
# a green run, and a green run is what the check produced on all four. That is
# the argument for a fixture rather than for more comments -- a rule nobody has
# watched refuse is not a rule, and three of the four defects above were written
# WITH a comment asserting the correct behaviour.
#
# The mutations are applied to a SYNTHESISED tree, never to the tree under test,
# so there is no revert step and nothing can be left behind. Each case asserts
# its mutation actually landed before any verdict is drawn from it: a mutation
# that did not apply satisfies a `must not appear` needle perfectly, and reports
# the guard as biting when nothing was staged.
#
# The BASELINE is the load-bearing case. Every refusal below is evidence only if
# the unmutated tree passes -- otherwise each case is merely observing the same
# pre-existing failure and would go on passing if the rule it names were deleted.
#
# What this does NOT do is judge the real documentation. That verdict is owned by
# `node-surface-docs` itself against the real tree; reproducing a verdict-clean
# corpus here would mean restating that script's pattern and exemption tables,
# and a second copy of a table is not a cross-check -- it is a second thing to be
# wrong, and it would redden this fixture whenever an unrelated row is added.

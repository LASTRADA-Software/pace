# The `clang-tidy` sweep still sweeps EVERYTHING somewhere, and that somewhere
# still reaches a person.
#
# ## The property, and why nothing else holds it
#
# Since #554 a pull request and a merge-queue entry both diff-scope, and the
# `push` on master is the only full sweep left. What makes that sound is an
# argument with two halves, both of which live in
# `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` and neither of which is visible in a run:
#
#   * master@N was proved fully clean by the `push` that landed it, so a scope
#     that over-approximates everything the next change can reach covers
#     master@N+1; and
#   * that `push` is the only place the full sweep still happens, so a finding
#     outside a change's include closure is seen there and nowhere else.
#
# Take the `--all` off that push and every run in this repository stays green
# while the analysis is permanently narrower than the rulebook says it is. There
# is no failing check, no slower job and no log line -- the sweep prints a
# confident count of a smaller number of translation units, which is the exact
# failure `scripts/tidy-sweep.sh` exists to make impossible one level down.
#
# Since #570 the mapping that decides all of this is ONE table -- `CiScopeTable`
# in `scripts/tidy-sweep.sh`, driven by that script's own `--self-test`. It used
# to be two GitHub expressions on the sweep step composed with the shell inside
# the script, so the mapping could only be reconstructed across two languages.
# The reader's `if:` below is a separate per-event expression -- who is TOLD,
# not how wide the analysis is -- and rule C still checks it here. #570's
# acceptance counts it as a third expression of the same mapping; it is not, and
# moving it would have made one table describe two things, so the deviation was
# decided rather than overlooked.
# This file therefore no longer checks a SPELLING; it checks the WIRING: that the
# workflow reaches the table (`--ci`), that it has not started deciding again
# alongside it, and that the one fact only the workflow holds gets there.
#
# The second half is the same shape one step further out. A master push blocks
# nothing and notifies nobody -- 18 of 18 failed master-push runs were never once
# re-run, measured and recorded in the rulebook -- so the report step is what
# turns that run into a signal. Delete it and the full sweep still runs, still
# fails, and still reaches no one. A check nobody reads is a check that does not
# exist.
#
# ## What is asserted rather than demonstrated
#
# This proves the SHAPE of the workflow, not the behaviour of a run: neither a
# master push nor a queue entry can be staged here. The behaviours it rests on
# are measurements, recorded in the rulebook rather than re-derived. What it can
# do is make the wiring impossible to remove silently, which is the half with no
# other guard -- `tidy-sweep.sh --self-test` covers the scope COMPUTATION, and
# nothing at all covered which events reach it with which scope.
#
# ## bash 3.2, and no `sed` in the self-test
#
# It is in the default ctest set and macOS ships a 2007 `/bin/bash`. No
# `mapfile`, no `declare -A`, no `${var^^}`.
#
# The self-test's broken workflows are GENERATED rather than produced by editing
# a correct one. Editing was the first shape and it was quietly wrong twice over:
# `sed` ranges like `/pat/,+2d` are a GNU extension that BSD sed rejects outright,
# and nothing checked sed's status -- so on macOS the edit failed, the fragment
# came out EMPTY, the check failed because there was no workflow at all, and the
# case printed `ok` for a break it had never staged. A generated fragment cannot
# fail that way, and every case additionally asserts its fragment DIFFERS from the
# correct one, so a knob that does nothing is a failure rather than a pass.
#
# Usage:  scripts/check-tidy-sweep-scope.sh [--self-test]
#
#   --self-test  drive every rule against generated workflows, in both
#                directions, and exit. Needs nothing but bash and awk.

# step.
#
# The whole `env:` block rather than one key: since #570 the step passes FACTS and
# the decision lives in `CiScopeTable`, so what matters is which facts reach the
# script, not what any one of them is called. Keyed on a single name, renaming the
# variable would empty the field and rule B would report the queue's base as
# deleted -- a red build accusing an author of something they did not do, which
# this file already carries two controls against.
#
# By what it RUNS, never by its name -- a step found by name is a step a rename
# turns into "no step matched", which every rule below would then pass over
# silently. Comment lines are dropped first: build.yml explains itself at length
# and much of what it says names the script, so a scan that reads comments finds
# three sweeps and can vouch for none of them.
#
# The whole `run:` block is joined and only THEN tested for the two markers,
# rather than testing line by line as it is read. Line by line, a step whose
# command sits on the `run:` key line itself was invisible -- reflowing
# `run: >-` plus a continuation into the identical one-liner made this report

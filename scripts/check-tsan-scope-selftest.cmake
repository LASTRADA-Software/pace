# `tsan-scope-hygiene` must be SEEN to refuse, on each thing it claims and on
# nothing else -- and to ACCEPT, which is the direction a guard is not known to
# work in until somebody has watched it.
#
# `tsan-scope-hygiene` runs the check against THIS tree, where a green run is
# equally consistent with the check working and with the check having quietly
# stopped reading. #317 is exactly that: a file-level match reported COVERED over
# a case that had left the sanitized scope, and every signal said clean. So the
# decisions get driven over a tree this file stages.
#
# ## The tree is staged FROM the check, never from a copy of it
#
# This file `include()`s `check-tsan-scope.cmake` with
# `PaceTsanScopeDefinitionsOnly` set, which returns before the scan, and
# then stages one file per row of the check's own `PaceTsanScope` and
# copies the real `scripts/tsan-gate.sh` and the real root `CMakeLists.txt` in
# beside them. So a row added to the check is a row this file stages, and the
# cases run against the tags the gate actually spells.
#
# A self-test carrying its own two-row scope would be the defect the check's
# header already records once: a second list is not a cross-check, it is a second
# thing to be wrong -- and one that had drifted would agree with itself perfectly
# on every run.
#
# ## The verdict is the OUTPUT, and it is FLATTENED first
#
# `message(WARNING)` exits 0 on every CMake while printing a diagnostic, so a
# check that merely warned would pass an exit-code test. And **CMake WRAPS a
# diagnostic at about 74 columns**, so a phrase can exist in the output and in no
# single LINE of it -- this repository has measured zero matches for a
# `FATAL_ERROR` phrase crossing that column, and a mutation harness once called
# all three of its arms green while the thing it drove was red. Every expectation
# here is matched against the flattened text.
#
# ## A spawn that never RAN is not a verdict
#
# `execute_process` reports a failure to LAUNCH as a STRING rather than a number,
# and a discarded `RESULT_VARIABLE` reads that as the check having answered --
# every `refuse` arm then passes and every `pass` arm fails, which presents as a
# rule regression and sends the next reader hunting a defect that is not there
# (#747, on `check-net-boundary-selftest`). It is INCONCLUSIVE here and says so.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-tsan-scope-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit: the verdict is the OUTPUT, not the status -- read through
# `FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`, because a `-P` script that merely WARNS exits 0.

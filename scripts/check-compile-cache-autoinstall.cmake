# Assert that cmake/portable/CompileCache.cmake declines to auto-install
# gracefully — and above all *without failing the configure* — whenever it
# cannot install one.
#
# That is the property issue #48 turns on. A build with no compiler cache is a
# slow build; a build whose configure aborts because a cache could not be
# downloaded is no build at all, and the module is vendored into repositories
# that have never heard of pace-kv. Every way the fetch can go wrong
# therefore has to end in one status line and a fall-through to sccache, ccache,
# or plain compilation.
#
# Written as a `cmake -P` script for the reasons spelled out at the top of
# check-repository-hygiene.cmake: the logic is the same everywhere, so a .sh and
# a .ps1 would be two implementations of one rule, each free to rot without the
# other noticing — and cmake is the one prerequisite a CMake project always has.
#
# The *sandbox* below is the part that is not portable, which is why this skips
# on Windows. To reach the code under test the three launchers must be
# unfindable, and CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM is the only knob that makes
# find_program come up empty without also hiding the toolchain. It redirects
# CMake's own `uname` lookup too, which leaves CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR empty
# (measured, Linux, CMake 4.2) — so the sandbox is seeded with a uname of its own,
# and a configure inside it differs from an ordinary one only in the launchers it
# cannot find. Which platform the module asks about is not left to that seed: the
# rows pin it (below). Windows resolves the host architecture from the
# environment instead and needs no such seed, but its generators find more of
# their toolchain through find_program than a sandbox can safely stand in for.
# The rules being checked are plain CMake and identical on every platform, so
# covering them on Linux and macOS covers them.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<repo> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<scratch>
#         -DPACE_CXX_COMPILER=<c++> [-DPACE_MAKE_PROGRAM=<make>]
#         [-DPACE_GENERATOR=<gen>]
#         -P scripts/check-compile-cache-autoinstall.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every row behaved, or skipped. 1 = at least one row did not.

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.28)

# One row per way the auto-install can decline, pipe-delimited:
#
#   <name>|<expected output>|<forbidden output>|<extra -D arguments>
#
# Every row additionally requires the configure to succeed: an exit code is the
# whole point here, so it is asserted for all of them rather than spelled per
# row. An empty expected or forbidden field means "do not check that".
#
# No row may contain a ';' — these are CMake lists, and a semicolon inside a row
# would split it in two. Arguments are separated by single spaces, so no
# argument may contain one either. Another way to decline is another row and
# nothing below changes.
#
# Every row asks about the SAME platform, whatever this host is: the module's
# first question is whether a binary is published for the host, and on a host
# that has none (#1432's aarch64 leg) every row stopped there and never reached
# the question it names. So the platform is pinned below to one the module
# publishes for, and the unpublished case is a row of its own that states a
# platform nothing is published for. no-such-release names the asset it tried,
# which is how it shows the pin reached the download and not only the lookup.

# Refuse when a translation unit is analysed by NOTHING.
#
# The clang-tidy sweep runs on `ubuntu-24.04` (`.github/workflows/build.yml`, the
# `clang-tidy` job), and `scripts/local-gate.sh` tidies through the Linux presets, so
# a TU whose entire body sits inside a guard that is false on Linux preprocesses away
# to nothing and is analysed by no analyser this project runs
# ([#682](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/682)).
#
# **The sweep already OBSERVES this, and that is not what this check adds.** #466 gave
# `tidy-sweep.sh` a per-unit produced/empty/unknown verdict; it prints the count, lists
# the in-scope files and qualifies its own verdict -- measured, `13 of 372 file(s)
# produced no code in this configuration` above a `CLEAN (359 of 372 …)` line. #682's
# premise that the sweep silently reports clean is FALSE, and this header said so too
# until it was checked against the real sweep rather than against the ticket.
#
# What is missing is enforcement, and it is four specific things:
#
#   * The sweep is INFORMATIONAL -- `rc=0` whatever the number. Nothing has to read it.
#   * It names only files in the CHANGE's scope, so a unit going blind elsewhere is
#     counted and unnamed.
#   * It cannot refuse a SWAP: one unit leaves the set, another joins, count unchanged.
#   * Its number carries no CONFIGURATION, and the number depends on one.
#
# So the honest claim is that the sweep observes this and does not enforce it. Anything
# stronger overstates, which is the defect this file is about.
#
# ## Why this MEASURES rather than greps
#
# A source scan cannot answer it. `#else`-less platform guards also appear at the END
# of files that are otherwise ordinary, and a TU can go blind on a FEATURE flag rather
# than a platform one -- `Net/TlsSocket_test.cpp` was empty without
# `PACE_ENABLE_TLS` and analysed with it, until #1596 moved it into core-cpp.
# Modelling the preprocessor to decide this fails the way any subtly wrong model does:
# in the confident direction. So this asks the OBJECTS what the compiler actually emitted.
#
# A TU that contributed nothing defines exactly the two symbols the sanitizer adds to
# every object; anything real defines hundreds. The threshold is therefore not a
# tuning knob, it is the gap between 2 and 672.
#
# ## Why the table cannot be the evidence
#
# `scripts/tidy-blind-spots.txt` lists what is known blind, with a reason each. This
# check compares it against the MEASURED set and refuses in BOTH directions: a TU that
# goes blind without a row is a new hole, and a row that is no longer blind is a claim
# that has gone stale. Neither can be silenced by editing the table, because the table
# is the expectation and never the input.
#
# Usage: check-tidy-blind-spots.sh <build-dir>   -- the measurement plus the table rules
#        check-tidy-blind-spots.sh --table-only  -- the table rules alone, no build needed
set -uo pipefail

# Named `refuse` rather than `fail`: `scripts/lib/e2e-common.sh` owns a shared `fail`
# for the e2e fixtures, which prints that suite's wording and signals the top-level
# shell. A hygiene check needs neither, and a second definition of a shared helper's
# name is what `check-e2e-helpers.sh`'s helper-scan refuses -- correctly, since the
# two would drift.
refuse() { echo "CMake Error: tidy-blind-spots: $*" >&2; exit 1; }

# `--table-only` is the half of this check that needs NO build (#589).
#
# The measurement below needs a compile database, the objects and `nm`, which is why
# `tidy-blind-spots` is registered on Linux with ASan and TLS on and runs NOWHERE else.
# But the TABLE's own rules -- every reached-by column names a leg that exists, and
# every `none` row carries a REASON -- are properties of two text files and the
# workflow. Gating those behind a build meant they were asserted on one configuration
# and on no other, which is the same shape as the residual the registration block
# records: a rule that reports nothing reads like a pass.
#
# #589's retargeted acceptance asks for exactly this: compiler-free, in the default
# `ctest` set, deriving the legs from the workflow rather than restating them, and
# refusing when either scan matches nothing.
#
# `--python3` is passed in rather than resolved here, following `scripts/coverage.sh`.
# The registration hands over the interpreter `find_package(Python3)` VALIDATED by
# running it -- which is what screens out Windows' App Execution Alias, a zero-byte
# reparse point named `python3.exe` that a bare `python3` on PATH finds happily and
# that does not run Python. The default keeps a hand-run working on a POSIX host.

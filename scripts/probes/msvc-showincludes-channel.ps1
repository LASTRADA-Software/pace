# Which stream does `cl /showIncludes` write its notes to, with and without `/EP`?
#
# This is the measurement #825 asks for and nobody on this team could take: it needs a
# real MSVC toolchain and every maintainer here is on Linux. Committed so that whoever
# next has a Windows host can settle it with one command instead of re-deriving the
# question -- a citation people can re-run is one they stop re-litigating, which is the
# idiom `redis-eof-semantics.py` and `ninja-msvc-deps-prefix.sh` set.
#
# ## The contradiction it settles
#
# Three sites in this tree said `cl` writes `/showIncludes` on **stderr**; the analysis
# on #700 and the review of #821 said **stdout**. Neither was measured. All three sites
# now say UNVERIFIED and point at `.agent/rules/compile-cache.md`, which states the
# question once -- so the tree no longer contradicts itself, and this is what replaces
# "unverified" with an answer.
#
# The `clang-cl` half IS measured (LLVM D46394): `/c` puts notes on stdout, `/EP` moves
# them to stderr so they do not corrupt the preprocessed text. Case 3 re-measures it
# here as a CONTROL -- if it disagrees with D46394 the probe itself is wrong, and no
# verdict about `cl` from the same run should be believed.
#
# ## Why it matters even though nothing is broken today
#
# At the one site that reads it, both regions are tagged `ShowIncludes` either way, so
# the replay is correct under either reading. It stops being inert the moment something
# ACTS on the channel, and something nearly did: #821 built a dispatch refusal on a
# predicate fed from stderr alone. Under one reading that guard covers `cl`; under the
# other it cannot fire for `cl` at all.
#
# ## Running it
#
#     powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\probes\msvc-showincludes-channel.ps1
#
# From a Visual Studio developer prompt, or anywhere `cl` and `clang-cl` are on PATH.
# Streams are captured to SEPARATE FILES rather than to a pipeline, because PowerShell's
# merge operators would answer the very question being asked.
#
# Record the output on #825, including the toolchain version and whether a language pack
# is installed: the answer may differ for a localized `cl`, which is the case #700 is
# about, and a reading taken on an en-US install does not settle a localized one.
#
# ## Recorded result -- a SECOND, independent reading (#825)
#
# #825 was already settled on CI's `Windows-cl-debug` (`windows-2025`, MSVC toolset
# 14.44) and the answer is in `.agent/rules/compile-cache.md`. #878's body still says
# the channel is "unmeasured and stated two ways in the tree", and that sentence is
# STALE -- checked against the rulebook rather than believed, which is the only reason
# this block does not claim to have settled anything.
#
# What it adds is a second reading on a DIFFERENT toolset and a different host, which
# is worth more than a re-run on the same one: the first reading could not tell a
# property of `cl` from a property of 14.44 or of a hosted runner. It agrees exactly.
#
# The conditions are PINNED here rather than pointed at, because they are the state of
# one machine at one instant and must not silently track anything that later changes.
#
#     Measured 2026-09-11, Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26200, Visual Studio 18 Community
#     cl 19.51.36252 for x64 (toolset 14.51.36231)
#     clang-cl 22.1.3 (llvm-project e9846648fd6183ee6d8cbdb4502213fcf902a211)
#     Language packs: NONE beyond en-US -- both installed toolsets carry exactly one
#     resource directory, 1033, and no other.

#     invocation      stdout   stderr   channel   CI's 14.44 reading
#     cl /c              1        0     stdout    stdout

#     clang-cl /c        1        0     stdout    stdout   <- control, agrees with D46394
#     clang-cl /EP       0        1     stderr    stderr   <- control, agrees with D46394
#
# Four rows, four agreements. Both controls agree with D46394, so the `cl` rows are
# believable by this probe's own stated standard.
#
# The rule the rulebook draws from this -- the channel follows the FLAG, not the driver
# -- now rests on two toolsets rather than one, which is the half a single reading could
# not support: 14.44 alone could not tell a property of `cl` from a property of 14.44.
#
# The #878 arm answered too, and negatively: `VSLANG=1031` produces byte-identical
# English output here, so the localized case is not exercisable on this machine. That
# is a property of the INSTALL rather than of the environment -- `VSLANG` selects among
# installed language packs and cannot conjure one. Measured separately at four values
# (1033, 1031, 1041, 2052) against both the banner and the note prefix, and on both
# toolsets. See the #878 entry in `.agent/rules/compile-cache.md`.

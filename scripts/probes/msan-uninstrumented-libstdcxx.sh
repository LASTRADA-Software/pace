# What MemorySanitizer does on this project's toolchain WITHOUT an instrumented
# standard library.
#
# This is the measurement behind #311, which asks for something in CI that catches
# an UNINITIALISED READ -- the defect ASan, UBSan, TSan and a release build all
# miss, and the one that surfaces in a cache daemon as a single wrong byte served
# as a success. #311 names two routes and says of the second that MemorySanitizer
# "needs an instrumented standard library and is a project in itself".
#
# That sentence was an assessment, not a reading. It is committed here as a
# reading, so the cost can be re-run rather than re-argued: a citation people can
# check is one they stop litigating.
#
# ## What it establishes
#
# MSan poisons everything an UNINSTRUMENTED object writes, because it cannot know
# what that code initialised. `libstdc++.so.6` is such an object on every ordinary
# Linux toolchain, and this tree links it. The question is not whether that is
# true in principle -- it is -- but whether the parts of libstdc++ a real test
# binary REACHES are out-of-line enough to poison anything.
#
# The answer is split, and the split is why a one-program probe would mislead:
#
#   * Header-only use is CLEAN. `std::vector`, `std::string`'s inline members and
#     `std::to_string` are templates instantiated into instrumented code, so a
#     program built only of those reports nothing. A probe that stopped here would
#     conclude MSan is usable, and be wrong.
#   * Out-of-line use REPORTS, deterministically. `std::ostringstream`,
#     `std::locale`, `std::filesystem` and throwing an exception each produce a
#     use-of-uninitialized-value inside `libstdc++.so.6` on a program with no
#     uninitialised read in it at all.
#
# The Catch2 test binaries reach the second set on every run, so an MSan job over
# this tree needs an instrumented libc++ (or libstdc++) BEFORE it can report
# anything about the tree. That is the "project in itself", measured.
#
# ## Why every arm carries a control, and why the control comes first
#
# An arm that reports nothing says nothing until something has been seen to
# report. Three drafts of this probe were wrong in exactly that way and each looked
# like a result:
#
#   1. At `-O1` the uninitialised read was FOLDED AWAY, so the positive control was
#      silent and a clean arm beside it read as "MSan is fine here".
#   2. At `-O0` with the value stored into a `volatile int`, the control was silent
#      again -- MSan reports a value that reaches a BRANCH, a syscall argument or
#      `main`'s return, and a STORE is none of those.
#   3. Only when the control branched on the value did it fire, and only then did
#      the arms below it mean anything.
#
# So: `-O0`, the value reaches an `if`, and the control runs first. If the control
# is silent this probe refuses rather than reporting its other arms.
#
# ## What it does NOT establish
#
# Whether the tree itself reports, and how much. That needs an MSan build of
# `PaceTest` with every dependency built from source -- this build links
# `libyaml-cpp.so.0.8`, `libssl.so.3` and `libcrypto.so.3` as system shared objects
# besides libstdc++, and each is a second poisoning surface. TLS can be turned off
# and yaml-cpp can be forced to build from source; libstdc++ cannot be waved away.
#
# Nor does it say anything about the valgrind route, which needs no rebuild at all.
# valgrind is not installed on the machine this was taken on; apt offers
# 1:3.22.0-0ubuntu3.

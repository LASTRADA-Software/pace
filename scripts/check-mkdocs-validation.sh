# `mkdocs build --strict` must be able to fail the way two files promise it does.
#
# `mkdocs.yml` and `.github/workflows/docs.yml` both state, in almost the same
# sentence, that `--strict` fails on a missing nav entry. It did not: mkdocs 1.6
# defaults `validation.nav.omitted_files` to `info`, so a page added under `docs/`
# and left out of `nav:` was reported at INFO and the build SUCCEEDED. Two files
# stating the same wrong thing is how it stayed wrong (#560).
#
# This asserts the PARSED configuration rather than grepping for a string, and it
# asserts the exemption too: `not_in_nav` must still cover the snippets, which are
# included into other pages rather than navigated to. Without that clause the
# validation fails the build on three files that are correct, which is how a
# validation flag gets turned back off by whoever meets it.
#
# It does NOT run mkdocs -- that is `.github/workflows/docs.yml`'s job and needs an
# install this suite cannot assume. What it guards is the configuration that makes
# that job able to fail at all.

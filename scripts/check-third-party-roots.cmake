# Third-party roots hygiene (#1370): every TREE-WIDE ENUMERATOR asks the one question
# "is this path first-party?" of `scripts/lib/third-party-roots.txt`, or carries an
# exemption row saying why the files it lists need no such answer.
#
# ## Why the enumerators are DERIVED
#
# Importing `vendor/` for #134 needed five enumerators told about it, each on its own:
# `tidy-sweep.sh`, the clang-tidy header filter and the registration derivation in
# `local-gate.sh`, `check-succeed-not-skip.cmake` and `check-target-file-guards.cmake`.
# Three of the five were found by REVIEW rather than by the import. Each answered "which
# files are this project's own?" separately, in its own grammar, with its own default --
# and an enumerator that had not learned about a root INCLUDED it, so third-party
# sources were linted, formatted, scanned and counted as first-party, silently and green.
#
# A list of enumerators would repeat that one level up: exact about the scripts it knows
# and silent about the next one. So what an enumerator IS is written down below as a set
# of SPELLINGS, the scan finds every site that spells one, and a site in a file that
# neither reads the roots file nor has an exemption row is refused. The sixth enumerator
# is refused on arrival, and nobody has to notice it.
#
# ## What counts as reading the roots, and what this does NOT cover
#
# A file reads the roots when it CALLS a reader outside a full-line comment. The readers
# are DERIVED from the two libraries that define them -- every public function of
# `scripts/lib/third-party-roots.sh`, and every `pace_*third_party*` function of
# `scripts/lib/CheckCommon.cmake` -- so a reader added there is recognised here without an
# edit. Naming the data file is not reading it, and neither is sourcing the library: the
# first version of this check accepted any mention of `third-party-roots`, which a comment
# satisfies.
#
# That is a FILE-level answer, not a per-site one -- a script whose one enumerator reads
# the roots and whose second does not passes. Stated rather than hidden, because a
# per-site rule would need to follow data flow through shell variables, which no line
# reader here can do honestly.
#
# Scanned: `scripts/` (`.sh`, `.cmake`, `.ps1`), `cmake/` (`.cmake`) and
# `.github/workflows/` (`.yml`). NOT scanned: `CMakeLists.txt` files, whose
# `GLOB_RECURSE` calls are relative to their own directories; C++ sources; and any
# spelling outside the set below. The spellings are a model narrower than bash, so a
# tree-wide walk spelled some other way -- a `for f in **` glob, a `ls -R` -- is not
# seen. Adding a spelling is adding a row.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. The verdict is `CMake Error` in the output, never the exit code
# (`check-script-check-signals.cmake`).
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-third-party-roots.cmake

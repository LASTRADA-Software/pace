# What each daemon EXITS with, through the real binaries.
#
# Who reads an exit decides what it must be (`Platform/ProcessExit.hpp`): a START is read
# by a supervisor, which restarts 1 and never 78; a ONE-SHOT command -- an install, an
# uninstall, a conversion, the node's worksheet -- is read by an operator, and answers 2
# for a decision a retry reaches again and 1 for what a retry may get past, a named file
# that is absent included, as a start does; a `--healthcheck` is read by a container
# runtime, which knows 0 and 1 only. The tables that say so are unit-tested. What only a
# process can show is the ROUTING: that each refusal in `main` reaches the table with the
# outcome the command line actually named. A site handing the refusal a start's outcome
# for an install's command line stayed green under every Catch2 case and answered 1 and
# 78 again (the review's P-N1), because neither `main` is in a test target.
#
# So every case here is a refusal, and exits before anything is opened, bound, or
# registered: no `--install-service` here reaches a service manager. Each install case
# carries a service name the registration refuses as well, so even a regression that got
# past the refusal under test would decline rather than register -- and the case would
# still fail, on its NEEDLE, since that refusal says something else.
#
# A start that got past its file by mistake would SERVE, so each start case also names a
# rule the start refuses after loading its file (the "bait"), and a control proves the
# bait: a file that loads, then the rule. Every run is bounded besides.
#
# POSIX-only, registered as a named skip on Windows, for `e2e-helpers-selftest`'s reason:
# the bounded runner is the shared POSIX library.
#
# bash 3.2: no `mapfile`, no `declare -A`, no `${var^^}`, no `local -n`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/exit-codes-e2e.sh <path-to-fastcached> <path-to-pace-node>
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every case behaved. 1 = at least one did not, or none ran.

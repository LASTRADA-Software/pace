# Read `off-thread-assertion-canary`'s run and report green exactly while
# `OffThreadAssertionGuard` (#1211) was watched BOTH accepting an assertion on the case's
# thread AND ending the process at one made on a helper thread.
#
# The guard exists because an off-thread Catch2 assertion damaged the heap a few runs in a
# hundred, and the crash then landed somewhere else. A guard that never fires would bring
# exactly that back, silently -- and so would one that is no longer attached, since it
# arrives through the Catch2 link and not through a list. The canary names no guard of
# its own, so this is also the check that the link still carries it.
#
# **Not a bare `WILL_FAIL`**, for the reason `write-slot-guard-gate.cmake` gives: a
# non-zero exit is not proof. It would accept a segfault, a missing shared library and a
# Catch2 that refused its command line alike. The gate requires the guard's own words, and
# keeps "never got that far", "survived" and "died of something else" apart from "the
# guard ended it".
#
# **And it requires the ACCEPT marker first.** A guard that ended the process at EVERY
# assertion would pass a refusal-only gate and break every test binary in the tree.

# Runs the CTest suite under Clang's source-based instrumentation and renders the
# coverage report. Invoked by the `coverage` target that cmake/Coverage.cmake
# defines, which is how CI runs it too -- one code path, so what a developer sees
# locally and what the workflow publishes cannot drift.
#
# Usage (the target passes all of this):
#   scripts/coverage.sh --build-dir DIR --source-dir DIR --llvm-profdata PATH \
#                       --llvm-cov PATH --python3 PATH -- OBJECT [OBJECT...]
#
# Every tool is passed in rather than looked up here, so a missing or
# version-mismatched one is a configure failure (cmake/Coverage.cmake) instead of
# something discovered at the end of a full test run.
#
# Outputs, all under <build-dir>/coverage:
#   html/index.html   the browsable report
#   coverage.lcov     lcov-format export, for Codecov and anything else
#   summary.json      llvm-cov's own per-file summary
#   report.txt        the per-file table, as printed
#   percent.txt       the line-coverage percentage, alone on one line

# What is measured, in one place, and expressed as an ALLOW-list rather than a
# list of things to drop.
#
# `src/` is where every first-party source in this repository lives, so handing
# llvm-cov that directory is the whole third-party exclusion: the standard
# library under /usr, the configure-time generated headers under the build tree,
# and CPM's dependency sources are all outside it, wherever they happen to sit.
# That last one is why this is an allow-list. A deny-list naming `/_deps/` looks
# correct locally, where CPM checks out into <build>/_deps -- and silently leaks
# in CI, where CPM_SOURCE_CACHE moves those trees to <workspace>/.cache/CPM
# instead. Catch2's headers instantiate into every instrumented test TU, so the
# figure would have been quietly diluted with third-party template code on
# exactly the runs that publish it, and on none of the runs that check it.

# Two exclusions remain, because they are inside src/ and are the apparatus
# doing the measuring rather than the code being measured:
#
#   /src/tests/   the shared harness -- test_main, ScratchPath, Unwrap.
#   _test.cpp     and this is the load-bearing one. Tests in this repository live
#                 NEXT TO the implementation, so ~150 *_test.cpp files under
#                 src/Pace/** and src/apps/** compile straight into the test
#                 binaries. Leave them in and the report measures the tests
#                 testing themselves: thousands of near-100% lines that move the
#                 total a long way and mean nothing whatever.

# spawn -- %p would leave one multi-megabyte raw profile per process, tens of
# gigabytes of them. %m keys the file on the binary's module signature instead
# and merges into it under a lock, so each binary lands in a pool of at most 8
# files no matter how many processes ran, and two different binaries can never

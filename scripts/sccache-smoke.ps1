# sccache smoke test (Windows / PowerShell). Mirrors scripts/sccache-smoke.sh:
# start pace-kv, point sccache at it over the chosen wire protocol, compile
# a one-file program twice, and assert the second compile is served from cache.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -File sccache-smoke.ps1 --pace-kv <path> [--protocol memcached|redis]
#        [--port <n>] [--compiler <cxx>] [--expect-flavor <name>]
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every assertion held; 1 = ran and something was wrong; 77 = a
# runtime prerequisite (sccache / pace-kv / compiler / a backend that is not
# compiled into this sccache) was missing.
#
# 77 is a SKIP under CTest (`SKIP_RETURN_CODE`) and would be a FAILURE from a
# GitHub Actions `run:` step, which is not told what it means. No CI job runs this
# driver today; the note is here so that adding one is a decision rather than a
# surprise.
#
# ## What this asserts, and why one assertion was never enough
#
# `Cache hits >= 1` alone is satisfied by sccache's own LOCAL DISK cache, so the
# fixture passed with no pace-kv in the picture at all, for as long as it
# existed (#1318). Three questions, because each is satisfied by the failing state
# of the next:
#
#   1. is the backend even IN this sccache        -- `Enabled features:`
#   2. did sccache USE it, or fall back silently  -- `Cache location`
#   3. WHICH DIALECT did it speak                 -- the daemon's own log
#
# (3) matters because `Cache location` reports the backend TYPE: a binary-speaking
# sccache reports `memcached, name: memcached, prefix: /` exactly as a text-speaking
# one does, so without it a leg named for a dialect could exercise the other and go
# on claiming coverage.
#
# ## The port and the readiness wait (#183)
#
# Both halves now match the POSIX driver, which is what #183 was left open for.
#
# The port is DRAWN per run, through `scripts/lib/E2EPorts.psm1` rather than a
# third copy of the draw: `RUN_SERIAL` stops these two smokes racing other ctest
# tests and says nothing about the socket the PREVIOUS serial test just closed,
# about a second worktree, or about a daemon a cancelled run left holding the
# port. On Windows a listener claims its address with `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE`, so a
# lingering bind fails outright rather than being quietly shared.
#
# The readiness wait is bounded and says what it waited for. The `Start-Sleep
# -Seconds 1` it replaces was neither, and it is the better explanation of the
# reported signature -- two failures in about five full `ctest` runs on one
# Windows workstation, passing 100% of the time when run alone. That is the
# difference between a loaded machine and an idle one, not between a colliding
# port and a free one; with ~2400 Catch2 processes in flight one second frequently
# is not enough, and the failure then surfaced as sccache being unable to reach a
# backend that was merely not up yet.

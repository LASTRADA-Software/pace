# Run the checks whose SUBJECT is documentation, without a build tree.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/doc-subject-checks.sh [--source-dir DIR] [--list] [--self-test]
#
#   --list       print the derived set and prove every row is runnable, but run
#                nothing. This is what `ctest -R doc-subject-checks-derivation`
#                drives against the real tree.
#   --self-test  drive every verdict against generated trees and exit.
#
# ## The failure this exists for
#
# Every check whose subject is documentation was skipped on exactly the pull
# requests that change documentation (#687). `scripts/ci-scope.sh` classifies a
# `docs/**`, `.agent/**` or `*.md` change as `code=false`, 36 job conditions in
# `.github/workflows/build.yml` gate their work on `code != 'false'`, and so a
# docs-only pull request runs no `ctest` at all. That is exactly right for the
# compiler jobs and exactly backwards for the handful of checks that exist to
# catch prose drifting away from code -- prose drifts by being EDITED, and a
# prose-only edit is precisely the change they never see.
#
# It is not hypothetical. Both live findings #462 fixed came from doc-side hand
# edits, and the check it added would have been green-by-absence on the very next
# docs pull request.
#
# ## Where the set comes from, and why not from here
#
# The set is the ctest tests LABELLED `docs-subject` in `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt`,
# READ out of that file rather than restated here. A second copy of the list would
# not be a cross-check, it would be a second thing to be wrong -- and it is the
# copy that decides what runs on a docs-only pull request, so a drift would leave
# exactly the intended checks unrun while this script printed a confident count.
# The invocation is read from the same place: the `-D` arguments and the `-P`
# script come out of each test's own `add_test()` block, so a check that grows an
# argument does not silently start running with the wrong one.
#
# The verdict rules are read from there too. `PACE_SCRIPT_CHECK_FAILED` is
# this tree's one spelling of "a `cmake -P` check failed" -- the verdict is the
# OUTPUT rather than the exit status alone, because the pattern also has to hear a
# check that merely WARNS, and a warning exits 0 on every CMake -- and a check's own
# `SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`, when it has one, is honoured. Restating either would
# make this script's verdicts drift from ctest's for the same checks.
#
# ## What it refuses, and why each refusal is not a skip
#
# Skipped, absent, unstarted and failed are four states, and an instrument that
# collapses them is #687 one level up -- a doc-check step that runs zero checks
# and reports green.
#
#   * a `docs-subject` label on nothing at all -> REFUSED. A scan matching
#     nothing is the ticket's own acceptance clause.
#   * a selected check whose command still contains an unsubstituted `${...}`
#     after `CMAKE_COMMAND` and `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` -> REFUSED BY NAME. Those are
#     build-tree facts (a binary directory, the resolved compiler), so the check
#     is not runnable from a bare checkout. Refusing rather than skipping is what
#     makes the label a decision instead of a wish: label a check this cannot
#     run and the docs job goes red until somebody decides.
#   * a selected check whose script is missing -> REFUSED.
#   * the fail-regex spelling missing from the CMakeLists -> REFUSED, because
#     without it every verdict here would be the exit status, which is 0 for a
#     failing 3.28 `-P` script.
#   * every selected check SKIPPED -> REFUSED. Absence of the negative is not the
#     positive; a run in which nothing failed because nothing ran is not a pass.
#
# ## One check in #687's table is deliberately not labelled
#
# `compile-cache-caveat` takes `PACE_SCRATCH_DIR`, `PACE_CXX_COMPILER`,
# `PACE_MAKE_PROGRAM`, `PACE_GENERATOR` and `PACE_MSVC_LIKE` --
# all build-tree facts -- and it CONFIGURES a throwaway project, which is why its
# ctest timeout is 600 s rather than 60. It cannot run from a bare checkout and it
# is not cheap enough to want to. That gap is stated rather than papered over: the
# caveat text it pins is not covered on a docs-only pull request, and the refusal
# above is what stops somebody closing that gap by labelling it and getting a
# silent skip instead.
#
# ## bash 3.2
#
# Registered in the default ctest set, so it runs on macOS's 2007 `/bin/bash`. No
# `mapfile`, no `declare -A`, no `${var^^}`, no `local -n`.

#   name <TAB> labels <TAB> skipRegex <TAB> arg <TAB> arg ...

# Indentation is not used as a discriminator anywhere here; the shapes are

# written and is robust to a reflow.
#
# TWO passes over the file, because a registration may name a variable the same
# file defines: `sccache-backend-caveat` is invoked with
# `-DPACE_SCAN_BUDGET_SECONDS=${PaceSccacheCaveatBudgetSeconds}`, and
# that variable is deliberately ONE value there serving both the argument and the
# ctest TIMEOUT, so the check's printed headroom is headroom against the number
# ctest enforces. Resolving it here keeps that single source of truth rather than
# putting a second copy of 180 in this script. A single forward pass would work
# today only because the `set()` happens to sit above the `add_test()`, which is
# an accident of layout and not a property.
#
# A `${...}` this table does NOT define is left alone on purpose, so it reaches

    # A failing check the way the CONTRACT allows one to present: the text on

    # shells out to another `cmake -P` without reading `RESULT_VARIABLE` exits 0
    # with its child's error on the output. That is why this tree reads verdicts
    # from output and why `PACE_SCRIPT_CHECK_FAILED` exists.
    #
    # It is here because the `noisy` fixture above CANNOT test that rule: measured
    # across six CMake versions (#565), `FATAL_ERROR` exits **1** on all of them,
    # so a verdict judged by the exit status alone passes every case built on
    # `noisy`. This comment attributed the exit-0 shape to CMake 3.28 until that
    # measurement; the fixture was right and only its reason was wrong.
    # Found by deleting the output half of the verdict and watching this
    # self-test stay GREEN -- the mode under test was not the mode in use, which
    # is the defect `.agent/rules/testing.md` records against
    # `check-catch-skip-return-code`. Both fixtures stay: one is what a real

    # invocation guaranteed not to execute, which is what an OOM kill or a failed
    # fork looks like from here. Asserted directly rather than through `Case`,
    # because `Case` is the thing under test.

    # 126/127, but a missing interpreter came back 1 on macOS -- measured, on the
    # runner -- so that trigger is not portable and the case failed for a reason
    # that had nothing to do with the verdict. Exec on a file without the bit is
    # EACCES, which every shell reports as 126.

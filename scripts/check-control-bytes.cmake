# No tracked text file carries a C0 control byte other than TAB and LF (#595).
#
# ## What this is about
#
# A `printf '\a'` that was meant to be `printf '\\a'`, a paste out of a terminal, an
# editor that inserted a literal escape: the byte lands in the file, and every
# instrument in this repository reads straight past it. It is not whitespace, so no
# formatter normalises it; it is not a comment introducer, so no comment stripper sees
# it; it is valid UTF-8, so the text gates pass it. #593 was one BEL in one shell
# script, and what made it expensive was not the byte -- it was that nothing anywhere
# could have found it. The instance is gone; the class had no guard at all, which is
# what this is.
#
# A C0 byte is invisible in a diff, invisible in review, and changes what a script
# DOES: inside a shell word it is an ordinary character, so a name, a path or a
# comparison silently stops matching the one everybody can see on screen.
#
# ## The file set is an ALLOW-LIST of extensions
#
# Not a denylist of paths. An exclusion list bets on how the tree is laid out and is
# silent about anything that arrives outside it; an inclusion list states what this
# check is for and says so in its own output. A file whose extension is not below is
# NOT scanned and NOT claimed about, and the run prints how many those were.
#
# It is deliberately not "every text file", because that question cannot be answered
# from a path: whether a given blob is text is a property of its bytes, and a check
# that guessed would refuse a binary the day somebody committed one.
#
# ## The bytes are never read as TEXT
#
# `file(READ)` is not a byte read, and every way it differs reports clean. Measured: it
# drops the CR of a CRLF on Windows and on Linux alike (`a\r\nb\n`, five bytes, reads as
# four), a 0x1A ends a text-mode read on Windows (`a\x1ab\r\nc\rd\n`, nine bytes, reads as
# one), and while the string HOLDS a NUL, the regex engine stops at one -- so a NUL, and any
# byte behind one, was never matched. This check missed every NUL until that was measured;
# its header used to say a NUL truncates the read.
#
# So the question is put to the file set as a question about bytes:
# `fastcached_tracked_files(CONTAINING_BYTES ...)` answers which files hold any forbidden
# byte -- in git mode one `git grep -a -P` over the whole set, in a walk by reading each file
# as HEX -- and only those files are read here, as HEX, to say which byte and where. A file
# the answer does not name holds none; nothing about it is read, which is what keeps this
# check from paying a read and a size per file over a DrvFs checkout.
#
# The answer and the byte pass are two readings of one file, so they can disagree -- the
# file changed between them, or the answer was wrong -- and a file the answer named that the
# byte pass finds clean is refused, by name, rather than taken as clean.
#
# ## Offsets and lines come from the hex, with the bytes separated first
#
# A two-character token searched in a raw hex string matches at odd offsets too --
# `a0 7b` contains `07` -- so every hit would need its alignment checked and a
# mis-aligned one would be a byte that is not there. Inserting a space after each pair
# removes the question: a two-character token can then only match at a multiple of
# three, which is a whole byte, so the offset and the newline count are both exact.

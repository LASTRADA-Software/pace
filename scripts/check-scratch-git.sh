# Every git WRITE a script or test fixture runs goes through the scrub: `scratch_git`
# (`scripts/lib/git-scrub.sh`) in bash, `pace_scratch_git` (`scripts/lib/CheckCommon.cmake`)
# in a `cmake -P` script.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# On 2026-10-02 a WSL `ctest -L hygiene` ran with `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` EXPORTED, so
# that WSL git could read a worktree whose `.git` pointer names a Windows path. Every self-test
# that stages a scratch repository inherited them, and its `git init` reinitialised the
# repository they named instead of the scratch tree -- writing `core.worktree` into the
# configuration all of this repository's worktrees share, after which git failed in every one
# of them. The scratch trees were never touched. `scripts/lib/git-scrub-variables.txt`
# names the variables; the helpers remove them from the one command they run.
#
# The helpers fix the sites that use them and say nothing about the next fixture, whose author
# writes `git init` because it is shorter and works on a machine where nothing is exported --
# which is every machine the author tests on. So this is the scan.
#
# ## What it looks for, stated as a pattern
#
# A git invocation at COMMAND position, spelled `git`, `"${GIT_EXECUTABLE}"` or
# `"${PACE_GIT}"`, after any number of `-C <dir>` / `-c <key=value>` options, whose
# subcommand is one of `WriteSubcommands` below. Command position is the start of a line or a
# `;`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `{` or `!` before it, or the words `if`, `then`, `do`, `else`, `elif`,
# `while`, `until`, `exec`, `command`, `env` or CMake's `COMMAND`, optionally followed by
# assignments or `env`'s `-u NAME` -- which is what keeps `echo "git add failed"` and
# `set(x "git init: ...")` out, and keeps `env -u GIT_DIR git init` in. Full-line comments are stripped
# first, because a comment is not a call site. Searched in every first-party `*.sh`, `*.ps1`
# and `*.cmake` under `scripts/` and `src/tests/`, and `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt`.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, said plainly
#
# A subcommand held in a variable (`foreach(step IN ITEMS "init;-q" ...)` was one), git spelled
# through any other variable (`"$gitBin" init`), an `execute_process(COMMAND` whose subcommand
# sits on a LATER line than the git, and git reached from Python or C++. Each of those escapes
# the scan and is a false NEGATIVE -- a site that reads as cleared. A `git config --get` is a
# read and is still flagged, which is the false POSITIVE direction: somebody meets it and adds
# an exemption row. An `env -u GIT_DIR git init` written by hand is flagged too, on purpose:
# a pasted scrub carries its own copy of the list, which is what drifted before this existed.
#
# ## Exemptions carry a reason, and a stale row is refused
#
# A script that writes the repository it was ASKED to -- not a scratch one -- legitimately
# inherits the environment, and is exempt by a row of `check-scratch-git-exemptions.txt`
# (`<path><TAB><reason>`). A row that no longer matches anything is refused, because an
# exemption kept past its subject excuses the next site at that path.
#
# ## The self-test drives the incident itself
#
# Beyond the scan's verdicts, `--self-test` exports `GIT_DIR` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` at a SCRATCH
# repository and runs two of the self-tests that wrote the shared configuration that day -- one
# bash, one `cmake -P`, one per helper -- and asserts that repository's configuration and index
# are unchanged. A control first shows the same exported pair DOES rewrite that configuration
# through an unscrubbed `git init`, so the unchanged reading is a finding rather than an
# instrument that cannot see a write. Remove the `unset` from either helper and its case goes
# red.
#
# It also holds the list to its derivation: `git-scrub-variables.txt` must name everything the
# RUNNING git's `rev-parse --local-env-vars` prints, and the names it carries from outside that.
# And it exports `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS` -- configuration every git command obeys -- injecting a
# clean filter whose command writes the victim when a fixture runs `add`, behind its own
# unscrubbed control: drop the name from the list and that case goes red beside the derivation
# case. Those controls spell git RAW, so the self-test scrubs its own environment first and then
# runs itself under an exported GIT_DIR and under GIT_INDEX_FILE alone, each aimed at a second
# scratch victim that must come back untouched.

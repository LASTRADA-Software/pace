# `check-test-names.cmake` is driven against staged trees, in BOTH directions.
#
# It had no self-test at all, which is what let three holes sit in it (#1261): a
# case whose name WRAPS to the next line left the reader entirely, a case declared
# in a file not named `*_test.cpp` was never globbed, and two of Catch2's
# case-declaring macros were missing from a pattern whose comment said all of them
# were there. None of the three lowers a number anybody compares -- a case that is
# never seen cannot -- so every one of them reported clean.
#
# ## The three cases that discriminate
#
# `wrapped-duplicate`, `unsuffixed-duplicate` and `template-method-dash` are the
# regression cases, and each is built so that the PRE-#1261 reader accepts it:
#
#   * `wrapped-duplicate` -- the same name twice, once inline and once wrapped. The
#     old reader saw one case and no duplicate.
#   * `unsuffixed-duplicate` -- the same name in a `_test.cpp` and in a plain
#     `.cpp`. The old glob read only the first.
#   * `template-method-dash` -- a dash-leading name on `TEMPLATE_TEST_CASE_METHOD`,
#     which the old macro pattern did not match.
#
# A case asserting only that the check "still passes on a clean tree" would be
# green under all three.
#
# ## Counts are asserted, not just verdicts
#
# The failure mode here is UNDER-counting, and an under-count is silent by
# construction: every one of the three holes produces a correct-looking verdict
# over a smaller population. So the accepting cases assert how many cases the
# check SAW, which is the only thing that moves when a reader stops reading.
#
# ## Every case runs a STAGED copy of the check
#
# `PaceDuplicateNameExemptions` ships with a row describing a real duplicate
# in this repository, and the check refuses a row that no longer describes one. A
# synthetic tree contains no such duplicate, so the shipped table is stale over
# every tree staged here and every case would refuse for that reason instead of
# its own. The copy therefore replaces the table -- with the case's own row, or
# with nothing -- and each run is asserted to have been judged by the copy.
#
# ## Read from the OUTPUT, never from the exit code
#
# `message(WARNING)` exits 0 on every CMake while printing `CMake Warning`, so an
# exit status cannot tell a refusal from a remark. Each case matches the check's
# own terminal text, FLATTENED first: CMake wraps its diagnostics at a column that
# depends on the scratch path's length, so a phrase can exist in the output and in
# no single line of it.

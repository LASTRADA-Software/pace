# No script under `scripts/` keeps a private awk walk over workflow YAML (#1456).
#
# ## Why this exists rather than the migrations being enough
#
# Five checks each carried their own model of a GitHub Actions workflow, and
# `scripts/lib/workflow-walk.awk` now serves all five. What that does NOT stop is
# the sixth: somebody writing a new check reaches for `/^  [A-Za-z0-9_-]+:/`
# because it is four characters and works on the file in front of them, and
# nothing anywhere says otherwise. Every one of the five was written that way, by
# somebody who was right about the file and wrong about YAML.
#
# ## What it looks for, stated as a pattern
#
# An awk regex literal anchored on a FIXED indentation -- `/^` followed by two or
# more literal spaces, or `/^[ ]{N}` with N above one -- in a first-party script
# or awk program that also names `workflows`. That is the shape of a column count
# standing in for a depth: `/^    if:/` is a job condition in `build.yml` and
# nothing at all in a file whose jobs sit deeper, which is legal YAML.
#
# A depth-RELATIVE pattern is not flagged and must not be: `/^[ \t]*$/` and
# `/^-?[ \t]*/` say nothing about how deep anything sits, which is the property
# the shared walk is built on.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, said plainly
#
# A fixed indent built at RUN TIME escapes it -- `awk -v job="  $2:"` was one of
# the spellings this ticket removed, and no textual scan can see it. So can a
# walk written with `substr($0, 1, 4)` or with `index($0, "    if:")`. The scan is
# the common shape rather than the class, and a check silent about a case reads
# exactly like one that cleared it.
#
# ## Exemptions carry a reason, and a stale row is refused
#
# A fixture GENERATOR legitimately spells the shape it stages -- it is writing a
# workflow fragment, not reading one -- so it is exempt by row rather than by a
# broadened pattern. A row that no longer matches anything is refused as stale,
# because an exemption kept past its subject silently excuses the next site that
# happens to look like it.

# answering nothing and the PATTERN being broader than its author reads it as, and only

#   HIT<TAB><path><TAB><line>:<text>   a fixed-indent literal, the line as it was judged
#
# One process for the whole tree, not a `grep` per script and an `awk`, a `sed` and a
# `grep` per script that names a workflow: under a loaded ctest a process start costs
# far more than the scan, and this timed out at 60 s. What is judged is unchanged:
#
# Full-line comments are stripped first, because a COMMENT is not a call site --
# and here that is load-bearing rather than tidy: every migrated check documents
# the column counts it used to carry, quoting them exactly, so a scan that read
# comments would refuse the four files that prove it is satisfied.
#
# `sed` expressions are stripped too. A `s/^        WfBlockOwner = .../` neuter
# and a staged `sed -i 's/^  cancel-in-progress: false$/...'` both carry the
# shape and neither reads a workflow: one edits awk source, the other writes a
# fixture. They are recognised by the `s` before the slash and by `sed` on the
# line, which is narrower than it sounds and is why the exemption file exists.
#
# A REGION may exempt itself, and this file is the reason the mechanism exists:
# the self-test below plants the very shape this scan refuses, as string
# literals, so without a region the scan flags itself over the real tree. The
# rulebook's rule is exactly this -- *a file that matches its own scan by
# construction exempts a REGION, never itself* -- and exempting the FILE would
# turn the scan off for the one file whose fixtures are its own evidence.
#
# The markers are BALANCED or the file is refused. A `begin` whose `end` was deleted
# would skip the rest of the file in silence, which is the whole-file exemption
# arriving by accident. `workflows` is looked for in the RAW line, comments and
# regions included, as the per-file `grep -Fq` did.
#
# The literal `[`, `]`, `{` and `}` of the pattern are bracket expressions rather than
# escapes, so every awk reads them the same way.

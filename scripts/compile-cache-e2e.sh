# End-to-end test of the compile cache (POSIX). Starts pace-kv, drives real
# compiles through pace-cc, and asserts the properties the launcher actually
# promises:
#
#   1. MISS then HIT      — a repeated compile is served from the cache.
#   2. Byte-identical     — the cached object equals the compiled one.
#   3. Large values       — an object past the daemon's 1 MiB socket send buffer
#                           still round-trips. Only such a reply reaches the
#                           reactor's park-and-resume path, and a bug there wedged
#                           a real build while every small fixture kept passing.
#   4. Cross-depth        — content stored from a DEEP checkout path HITs from a
#                           SHALLOW one, which is the whole reason this launcher
#                           exists instead of ccache/sccache.
#   5. Convergence        — after a header MOVES with its contents unchanged, the
#                           replayed depfile names the new path. Preprocessing
#                           suppresses line markers, so the object is invariant
#                           under such a move; a hit would otherwise replay a
#                           depfile naming a file that no longer exists, and Ninja
#                           would rebuild that TU on every build, forever
#                           (issue #53). The dependency set is part of the key, so
#                           the two layouts are two keys and the pre-move entry
#                           survives the move (issue #56).
#   6. Content in the key — an edited source must MISS. The preprocessed text is
#                           the only key input carrying the source's content, so a
#                           probe that captures none of it answers an edit with the
#                           previous revision's object: a wrong build, silently.
#                           Asserted with direct mode OFF, since its manifest hashes
#                           the source's own bytes and would mask exactly that.
#   7. Relative paths     — a build whose driver reports relative dependency paths
#                           must still record a manifest naming them. They lie under
#                           no root, so a classifier that asked "is this toolchain
#                           content?" before "is this anchored anywhere?" dropped
#                           every one of them, and an empty manifest validates
#                           against anything: an edited header served the previous
#                           object under a zero exit code, permanently.
#  10. Root-bound object — a translation unit whose object names its checkout
#                           (`__FILE__`, `source_location`) is not served into a
#                           second checkout in either direct mode, one naming no
#                           path still is, the first checkout still hits its own
#                           copy, and a hit PACE_VERIFY rejects is logged
#                           VERIFY-MISMATCH rather than HIT.
#  11. Mid-compile save — a save DURING a compile records nothing unsound
#                           (#1650): the compile that raced an editor's save stores
#                           nothing and is logged INPUTS-MOVED, and the saved content
#                           is a MISS that builds what was saved and stores it, in this
#                           checkout and in another. The raced manifest names the KEYED
#                           content, so an object another checkout stores under that key
#                           is never served to the saved content. Through the same stub
#                           with no save, a compile still stores, direct-hits, and
#                           shares across checkouts.
#   2c. Dropped object    — the operator's repair after 2b names a wrong object: the
#                           key is dropped over CACHE-DROP while its direct-mode
#                           manifest stands. The next compile must MISS, recompile
#                           and store, and the one after must HIT (#1276). Runs with
#                           2b, so it needs --testclient.
#
# The PowerShell counterpart (src/apps/pace-cc/run-launcher-e2e.ps1) asserts
# the same contract against cl / clang-cl on Windows — except case 7, which has no
# Windows twin on purpose: `cl` resolves every `/showIncludes` note through the
# filesystem and reports an absolute path whatever the `/I` spelling, so the case's
# own premise ("the driver reported a relative path") cannot hold there, and a case
# that silently degrades to a tautology is worse than an absent one. clang-cl does
# echo the spelling it was handed, so a clang-cl-only variant would be meaningful;
# the classification itself is pinned by DirectManifest_test on every platform.

# (the plain daemon and the authenticating one), which is exactly the shape the

# fixture stays below, at the check that the daemon still listening is the one it
# started: this test's readiness probe cannot tell its own daemon from a

#
# It matters because every root test in `PathCanon` is a prefix comparison, so
# from the outer layout's point of view every file in the inner tree is in-tree
# source, and both trees canonicalize their own `src/inc/h.hpp` to the identical
# token `<SRCROOT>/src/inc/h.hpp`. Two different files, one token.
#
# Sharing is nonetheless CORRECT, because the preprocessed text is part of the
# key -- but that is an argument, and arguments are what regression tests are
# for. Anyone running `git worktree add .worktrees/foo` inside their checkout
# produces exactly this shape, which makes it a good deal more ordinary than a
# symlinked or substituted root.
#
# `PACE_NO_DIRECT=1` throughout, so what is exercised is the OBJECT key
# rather than the manifest -- the manifest path would answer from recorded

# --- 5: a moved header must not replay a depfile naming its old path ---------

# record names a file that no longer exists. Ninja records that dependency, cannot
# stat it, rebuilds the TU, hits the cache again, and never converges.
#
# The dependency path set is folded into the key, so the two layouts are two
# different keys and the move is a MISS by construction rather than a hit some
# guard had to catch and discard. Both properties are asserted below, because they
# are distinguishable and only the second one holds: the move must produce no
# "STALE HIT", and the PRE-MOVE entry must still be there afterwards.

# The property Ninja actually needs: every dependency a depfile lists must exist.
# Splices `\`-continuations, drops each rule's target (an output, and here one we
# deliberately deleted), and stats what remains. The field separator is a string
# rather than a /regex/ literal: as split()'s third argument a literal evaluates
# to 0 or 1 in a strictly-POSIX awk, and this runs on the BSD awk macOS ships.

# no root at all. So a build whose driver reported relative paths (a relative `-I`,
# or a compile run from the source directory, which is how the CMake Ninja generator
# spells its sources) recorded a manifest with those entries silently missing, and an
# empty manifest validates against anything. Edit a dropped header, leave the .cpp
# alone, and the direct hit fires on a stale object with a zero exit code — forever,
# because a direct hit never re-records the manifest that let it through.
#
# Unit tests pin the classification; only this can show that the driver really does
# report relative paths and that the whole flow survives them, which is the same

# --- 8b: every way a dead cache can be silent, inside a bound -----------------
# The leg above is one shape of a dead cache: a port that refuses. A peer that is LISTENING
# but never accepts, and one that accepts and then resets, are the other two, and a
# regression specific to one of them -- a launcher that waits forever on the silent one --
# would pass the leg above. So each shape compiles here against a peer of its own, must exit
# 0 with the object a working cache would have left, and must do it inside a BOUND: a hang is
# then a named failure rather than the test's own timeout.
#
# The bound is DERIVED, never picked, and it is per SHAPE. The baseline is the same compile
# against the live daemon, on the same monotonic clock: what a compile costs when the cache
# works. One compile makes at most `dead_exchanges` exchanges before it gives up on the cache --
# direct mode's manifest round trip, then the object fetch; never the STORE, which a fetch the
# cache did not serve skips (`pace-cc --help` says the same under PACE_TIMEOUT). No
# scheduler is configured, so there is no dispatch budget to add.
#
# What ONE exchange can cost is the deadline that ends it, which differs by shape -- the
# `dead_shapes` table below:
#   never-accepting    the connect completes into the backlog, so the exchange runs out TOTAL
#   refused            the dial fails: at once here, after SYN retries on Windows, never past CONNECT
#   accept-then-reset  the RST arrives at once; at most CONNECT
# Those costs compose the leg's HANG bound -- baseline + N x cost + cost / 2 + `dead_wall_slack_ms`
# -- and nothing else. HOW MANY exchanges a leg spent is COUNTED, never inferred from time: every
# cache exchange the launcher makes goes through one door that says so on its verbose trace
# (`cache exchange (...)`), and each leg asks for exactly `dead_exchanges` such lines; the reset
# peer counts its accepts too, and the two must agree. Time judged the count twice and both times
# measured the HOST: a wall-clock bound with half an exchange of slack failed on loaded Windows
# runners (round 8), and so did the launcher's own exchange time on a starved one (round 9, 3616
# ms for two 1000 ms dials). A launcher that is not scheduled cannot fire its deadline on time;
# its count is the same however slow the machine is. run-launcher-e2e.ps1 holds the same legs,
# with the never-accepting peer counting too and a floor on that leg's reported time.
#
# Time still judges what a slow host cannot fake. never-accepting, whose exchanges can end only at
# TOTAL, holds the launcher's OWN reported time (`direct-ms` + `cache-ms`) to a FLOOR of N x TOTAL
# less a timer's resolution -- a timer reading 0 fails it -- and a CEILING of (2N - 1/2) x TOTAL,
# 7000 ms at N = 2 and TOTAL = 2000. An exchange that DOUBLED its deadline reports 2N x TOTAL =
# 8000 (measured 8006-8017 by run-launcher-e2e.ps1) and fails it by TOTAL / 2 = 1000 ms; one that
# IGNORED PACE_TIMEOUT falls back to the default total of 10000 ms per exchange and reports
# about 20000. A stall of up to (N - 1/2) x TOTAL = 3000 ms past the floor still passes: a stall
# belongs to the HOST, and the host's worst measured overrun is +1616 ms (round 9, on the refused
# leg). The former (N + 1) x TOTAL, 6000 ms, tolerated a stall of 2000, only 384 above that
# overrun, and at N = 1 it would equal a doubled TOTAL and catch nothing. The `dead_shapes`
# table's third column names the deadline a shape is held to that way, or `-`.
#
# BLIND SPOTS, failing OPEN. A retry INSIDE one exchange -- in the dial, below the door -- is one
# trace line, seen only as an extra accept on the reset leg. A WAIT anywhere is judged only by the
# hang bound. And whether CONNECT is honoured end to end is judged by no leg: a stall moves a
# refused dial past any ceiling tight enough to see a doubled CONNECT (round 9, +1616 ms on
# Windows); the deadline MECHANICS are ReactorExchange_test's, and only the environment-to-budget
# wiring of CONNECT is left to the hang bound.

# Two distinct properties are asserted here, and the second is easy to break while
# fixing the first:
#
#   a) The two spellings must key TOGETHER, so a compile driven through the link
#      shares its entry with one driven through the real path.
#   b) A replayed depfile must keep the spelling THIS BUILD uses. Its rule target
#      has to be byte-identical to the `-o` path the build passed, or Ninja fails
#      outright ("expected depfile ... to mention ...") and make matches no rule at
#      all and silently drops every header dependency. Reconciling the ROOTS to
#      their resolved form satisfies (a) and breaks (b); reconciling the emitted
#      paths INTO the build's own spelling satisfies both.
#
# Direct mode is off because this is about the PREPROCESSED key: `KeyDependencySet`
# and the "dependency set: N of M reported path(s) keyed" line only exist on that
# path, and a direct hit would reach the object without ever computing them.

# --- 10: an object naming its checkout is not served into another -----------
# A translation unit that bakes its own path into program data -- `__FILE__`, or the
# builtin `std::source_location` is made of -- must not be served into a second
# checkout, in either direct mode, while one that bakes none still is; the checkout
# that stored a root-bound copy must still hit it; and a hit PACE_VERIFY rejects
# is logged VERIFY-MISMATCH, never HIT. No key can see those paths: the direct-mode
# key never sees the `__FILE__` expansion and `source_location` reaches no key at
# all, so the launcher reads the OBJECT (apps/pace-cc/RootBinding.hpp). Before
# that, `__FILE__` with direct mode on and `source_location` in both modes printed
# the first checkout's path from the second.
#
# The outcome of the second checkout is per kind, and that is the discrimination:
# `srcloc` shares a portable key with the first (the builtin reaches no key), so it
# meets the first checkout's marker and is a BOUND-MISS; `file` does not share one on
# the preprocessed path, so once direct mode declines it is an ordinary MISS; `none`
# is a HIT of the first checkout's very bytes.
# The tree includes a PROJECT header, and that is load-bearing: a translation unit
# reporting no dependency records no direct-mode manifest, so a "direct on" leg would
# never reach direct mode -- where `__FILE__` was mis-served -- and would pass with the

# --- authentication ---------------------------------------------------------

# SessionContext::CurrentAuth(), so a daemon started with --requirepass gated
# memcached and RESP while serving this port to anyone. Three properties, and
# the third is the one that would rot silently:
#
#   a) the wrong credential (or none) is REFUSED, so the gate is real;
#   b) the build still SUCCEEDS anyway, because a cache that cannot be reached
#      must never be load-bearing -- a gate that broke builds would be reverted
#      by the first person it bit;
#   c) the right credential still HITs, i.e. authenticating did not cost the
#      cache its function. A gate that refused everybody would pass (a) and (b).

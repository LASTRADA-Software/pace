# Drives scripts/check-instruction-set-flags.cmake over synthetic compile databases in both directions, so the
# check is seen to REFUSE every spelling it exists for and to ACCEPT every one it must leave alone: a guard
# nobody has watched accept is not known to work either. Each case is named by its first field or argument.
#
# The bracket cases are deliberate: the violation alone, the violation behind a bracket-bearing define, the
# define alone, and an unbalanced bracket inside a candidate token -- without the accepting arm, a check that
# refused every bracket would pass the middle one for the wrong reason, and only the last one needs the
# blanking at all.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<repo> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-instruction-set-flags-selftest.cmake
#
# The verdict is `CMake Error` in the output, never the exit code.

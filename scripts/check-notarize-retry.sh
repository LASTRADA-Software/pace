# `pace_notarize` retries a STALL and never retries a VERDICT.
#
# `cmake/MacOSNotarizePkg.cmake` bounds `notarytool submit --wait` and retries it,
# because an unbounded wait hands the ending to the runner, which answers after
# thirty minutes with no statement of what did not finish
# ([#376](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/376)).
#
# **The property that needs a guard is not the timeout, it is the distinction.**
# Apple answering "Invalid" is an answer; retrying it spends the budget to be told
# the same thing, and on a release path that is half an hour per attempt. `_rc`
# separates "no answer arrived" from "one did, and `status` decides it" -- and that
# is exactly the kind of condition somebody simplifies away while making the retry
# "more robust". A guard nobody has watched refuse is not a guard.
#
# It drives the REAL function out of the real file with a fake `xcrun` on PATH, so
# what is exercised is what ships rather than a restatement of it -- which is the
# rule this change's own rulebook entry is about.
#
# Runs anywhere `cmake` and a shell do; it never invokes a macOS tool.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The budget is per ARTEFACT and spent ACROSS attempts, so a SLOW failure is not
# retried where a FAST one is (#1156).
#
# The two cases above and this one are the same fake in every respect except how
# long it takes to fail, which is the whole discrimination: `notarytool submit`
# uploads and enqueues a NEW submission, so retrying after a stall joins the back of
# the same slow queue with less time than the first attempt had. Measured on the run
# that filed #1156, two attempts spent twenty minutes to be told the same thing
# twice.
#
# The budget is shrunk through `CPACK_PACE_NOTARY_BUDGET` because no
# test can wait 600 s to watch this; that seam exists for this case and for nothing
# else, and `cmake/Packaging.cmake` does not export it. Six seconds, so the FIRST
# attempt still clears the minimum-attempt floor the hook derives from the budget --
# a case that failed by skipping attempt one would pass this assertion for the wrong
# reason.
# TWO clauses gate the retry and they cover different failures, so there are two
# cases. Stated plainly because ONE of them cannot be isolated by any test here, and
# a reader who does not know that would delete the clause it protects:
#
#   * the previous attempt returned an EXIT CODE (`_rc` is a number). A bound that
#     fired, or a command that never started, is not asked again.
#   * and there is budget LEFT. A numeric failure that took most of the budget is
#     not retried either.
#
# On a well-behaved clock those two agree for a TIMEOUT -- the bound is the whole
# remaining budget, so firing it exhausts the budget by construction -- and the case
# below therefore fails only if BOTH are removed. That is not a reason to drop
# either: the `_rc` clause exists for a clock that is NOT well behaved, measured on
# this project's WSL2 development host at ~2 s backwards every ~32 s, where the
# clock-only version reported two submissions in 3 of 15 runs with its own log
# saying "after 4s of a 6s budget" for an attempt killed at six. No `cmake -P` test
# can inject a clock step, so that clause is argued rather than asserted.

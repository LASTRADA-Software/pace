# The gate .agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md asks for, as a script rather than
# as a paragraph.
#
# "Build at least one release configuration and one non-clang compiler locally
# before pushing" is advice that has to be remembered, and this branch has twice
# paid a full CI cycle for forgetting it -- once for a GCC -O3 `-Wnull-dereference`
# through an inlined `memcpy`, which clang does not emit at any level, and once for
# a clang-tidy check the version on PATH had never heard of.
#
# Both are configurations a developer HAS and does not run. So this runs them.
#
# What it covers, and why each earns its minutes:
#
#   clang-format  the BUILD CI formats with: the PyPI release .clang-format-version
#                 declares, refused before `-i` when no binary on PATH (or in
#                 PACE_CLANG_FORMAT) is it (#1349, #1407). Two builds -- even of one release number --
#                 can disagree about formatting, so a tree clean under whatever is on
#                 PATH can still be rejected, for code nobody mis-wrote.
#   clang-debug   PEDANTIC + ASan + UBSan + clang-tidy, the ANALYSER pinned to the
#                 one build .clang-tidy-version declares and identified by its wheel,
#                 not by a name (#1404). The default agent preset, the only place sanitizers
#                 run at all, and the only preset here that tidies anything -- which
#                 is why the other one says so out loud rather than leaving a reader
#                 to infer that the gate's tidy coverage is both.
#   gcc-release   The second compiler, at -O3. A different warning set, and
#                 optimizer-dependent diagnostics that appear at no other level.
#
# And what it refuses to let anything else decide: both configurations are built
# with NO compiler-cache launcher. `-DUSE_COMPILER_CACHE=OFF`, checked afterwards
# against the generated build rather than assumed from the flag.
#
# That is not this script's own rule. `scripts/launcher-replay-e2e.sh` calls it
# "the standing -DUSE_COMPILER_CACHE=OFF rule" and records what it is for: in
# #319 a cache-backed build of a test binary segfaulted while the same commit
# built cache-off passed, and nothing in CI could have reported it.
# `CMakePresets.json` carries the same value on `clang-coverage` for an
# independent reason. So the project has taken this decision twice and written it
# down twice -- and until now the gate was the only reference build in the tree
# that dissented, silently, because `USE_COMPILER_CACHE` defaults to ON and this
# script never mentioned it. Measured before the fix: 148 `LAUNCHER = ` lines in
# `clang-debug` and 618 in `gcc-release`, every one of them pointing at whichever
# launcher happened to be installed, at whatever version, with no check and no
# mention (issue #471).
#
# The gate's verdict is a claim about a SOURCE TREE. A pinned analyser and a
# pinned formatter are pinned because their version changes that verdict and
# there is a canonical version to pin to; a compiler cache has neither, and is
# supposed to be verdict-NEUTRAL. When it is not, it substitutes an object the
# tree did not produce. So the same argument that pins the other two tools
# removes this one, rather than versioning it.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT cover: MSVC and clang-cl, which need Windows, and
# macOS/libc++, which needs a Mac. Those stay CI's job, and the point of this script
# is that everything reproducible locally is reproduced locally.
#
# Usage:  scripts/local-gate.sh [--no-format] [--self-test] [--classify=<log>]
#
#   --no-format  skip the clang-format pass. It does NOT loosen the clang-tidy pin:
#                those are two tools and the flag names one of them.
#   --self-test  check the configure decision against synthetic CMake caches, and
#                the launcher refusal against synthetic `build.ninja` files, then
#                exit. Needs no compiler, no cmake and no clang-tidy, which is what
#                lets `ctest -R local-gate-selftest` run it everywhere.
#   --classify=  read a captured gate log and say what happened to the run that
#                wrote it -- one word per row of the `gate_outcomes` table below,
#                with a distinct exit status for each. `-` reads stdin. See "A run
#                that never concluded" below. The rows are deliberately NOT listed
#                here: this line named four of them while the table held six, and a
#                stale list reads as complete.
#
# A real run takes this host's gate lock ITSELF, before it reads the tree, so run it
# bare -- see "One gate per host, and the lock is taken HERE" below (#1379).
#
#   PACE_GATE_LOCK       the lock file. Default `$HOME/.fastcached-local-gate.lock`.
#   PACE_GATE_LOCK_WAIT  seconds to queue for it before refusing. Default 10800.
#   PACE_GATE_STOP_AFTER_LOCK  the self-test's seam: stop once the lock stage has
#                              decided, checking nothing, with `no-gate-run`'s status.
#
# ## A run that never concluded (#584)
#
# The verdict came from `fail()` and from the green path, and NEITHER runs when the
# process is killed. So a run terminated by a signal ended with no `GATE FAILED`,
# no `LOCAL GATE PASSED` and -- after #501 -- no leg block either, and the only
# thing distinguishing it from a completed run was the ABSENCE of both lines. That
# is a real signal and a fragile one: absence is also what a scrolled-past line, a
# truncated log and a lost terminal look like.
#
# It is not hypothetical. Every lane on a shared machine runs these same script
# names out of different worktrees, so a name-matched `pkill -f local-gate.sh` in
# one lane hits every other lane's run -- the worktree path appears nowhere in the
# pattern.
#
# **A trap does not fix this here, and that is measured rather than assumed.** Bash
# defers a TRAPPED signal until the running foreground command returns, and this
# gate's foreground commands are `cmake`, `ninja` and `ctest`. Measured on bash
# 5.3: SIGTERM sent at t=2s into a 6s foreground command ran the handler at t=6s.
# The standard workaround -- background the command and `wait` for it, which bash
# interrupts -- does fire immediately (t=2s, measured), and it is WORSE here: the
# child is orphaned and reparented, so the gate would report `did-not-conclude`
# while leaving `ninja` still writing into the build directory. A developer's
# re-run then races an orphaned build in the same `binaryDir`, which is the
# two-gates-in-one-build-directory defect this rulebook already names. A late trap
# is close to no trap; an early one that orphans the build is a worse bug than the
# reporting gap it closes.
#
# So the route is a START MARKER plus a rule, and the rule is:
#
#     A log with a start marker and no terminal line DID NOT CONCLUDE. Re-run it.
#     Never interpret it, and never read it as a red gate.
#
# `did-not-conclude` is a distinct outcome from `failed` because they are fixed in
# different places -- one is somebody else's `pkill`, the other is your code. It is
# the fifth state beside skipped / absent / unstarted / failed.
#
# `--classify` is that rule as a function rather than as prose, so the tooling
# around a run can tell. It is pure -- log text in, one word out -- which is why
# `--self-test` drives every outcome in milliseconds. Capture BOTH streams into the
# log (`> gate.log 2>&1`): the failure line goes to stderr and the pass line to
# stdout, and a log holding only one of them can answer only half the question.
#
# Exits non-zero on the first configuration that fails, having printed its errors.
# It never runs ctest against a build that did not complete -- a stale binary
# reporting a green suite is the failure mode this ordering exists to prevent, and
# it has happened here.
#
# Because it stops at the first red leg, EVERY run -- red or green -- ends with a
# per-leg verdict naming what passed, what failed, and what never started. Stopping
# early is right; saying nothing about the legs it skipped was not, and
#
#     GATE FAILED: gate-clang-debug tests
#
# read as "the rest passed" when the rest had not been asked. What that cost, and
# why the renderer below is a pure function, is in
# `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` (#501) -- one place, so a citation cannot
# drop the conditions the measurement came with.
#
# Reading a red run of THIS script: the leg block is the answer to "how much of the
# gate actually ran". For the failure itself, read the raw log the message names --
# ninja's diagnostic begins with a `FAILED:` line and puts the error text several
# lines BELOW it, so a wrapper filtering on `error|warning:` alone can surface an
# unrelated warning and none of the actual failure. Filter on `FAILED:` as well, or
# not at all.
#
# **bash 3.2**, because `--self-test` is in the default ctest set and macOS ships a
# 2007 `/bin/bash`. No `mapfile`, no `declare -A`, no `local -n` -- and no bare
# `"${arr[@]}"` on an array that can be EMPTY, which is an unbound-variable error

# Outcome, exit status, and what a reader should do about it.
#
# A table, so the statuses are DERIVED from one place and the self-test can assert
# what the ticket actually requires -- that no two outcomes share a status. A
# killed run rendering as a red gate is the failure being fixed; two rows that
# drifted onto one number would rebuild it silently.
#
# `0` and `1` are the gate's OWN statuses for those two outcomes, so classifying a
# log answers with what the run itself answered -- and so are `7` and `8`, which a
# run that never got the host lock exits with, `9` and `10`, which a run whose
# tests did not fail and cannot be vouched for exits with, and `11`, which a run
# whose analyser could not analyse anything exits with. `2` is skipped
# deliberately and is the interesting one: it is this script's usage status, and
# `--classify=$LOG` with an unset `LOG` is a usage error -- a caller reading only the
# status would take "you typed that wrong" for "the run was killed". The two are not
# commensurable, so no outcome may sit on it, and the self-test asserts that rather
# than trusting it.
#
# EVERY status `--classify` can exit with, including `unrecognised` and
# `unreadable-log`, which are not verdicts about a log at all -- one says this gate
# has no row for an outcome, the other that the log could not be read. They belong
# in the table for the reason the table exists: a status spelled as a literal
# somewhere else is invisible to the distinctness assertion below, so it can drift
# onto another one silently, which is the whole failure being prevented.

# What a gate LOG says about the run that produced it. PURE: log text on stdin,
# one outcome word on stdout, nothing else read and nothing written.
#
# The LAST start marker wins, and a terminal line counts only when a marker came
# before it -- except the two `GATE NOT STARTED:` lines, which by definition have no
# marker to follow and are the last event of the invocation that printed them. Both
# halves are load-bearing:
#
#   - A log file is reused. A `/tmp` wipe once left a PREVIOUS run's durable copy
#     sitting where the current one goes, and it reported a failure already fixed;
#     only an accident of timestamps told them apart. So a green run followed by a
#     killed one is `did-not-conclude`, which a `grep -c PASSED` gets backwards.
#   - A terminal line with no marker before it is not attributable to a run this
#     log can show, so it is `no-gate-run` rather than the verdict it looks like.
#     Escalating every way of not knowing to "re-run it" is the fail-closed
#     direction, and the only one that cannot silently vouch for a tree.

# One gate per host, and the lock is taken HERE (#1379).
#
# `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` required the gate to be serialised across lanes
# with `flock`, and this script took no lock. Serialisation lived in each session's
# WRAPPER and nothing in the repository named a path, so every lane invented one and two
# lanes serialised only when they happened to coincide. Measured: one lane's `flock` was
# on a path no other lane used, three gates ran at once on one host, and that lane's
# lock had acquired instantly every time -- which is exactly what a lock nobody else
# takes looks like, and exactly what a free host looks like. So the path is defined ONCE,
# below, and the lock is taken by the thing being serialised. A lane that runs the gate
# is serialised whether or not it wrote a wrapper, which is the only form of this rule
# that cannot be satisfied by omission.
#
# **Per USER, under `$HOME`, and that is chosen rather than settled for.** A host-wide
# path means `/tmp`, and WSL wipes `/tmp` when it idles out. `flock` on a file that is
# UNLINKED while held leaves the holder locking an orphaned inode, and the next opener
# creates a fresh file and acquires it: two holders, no error from either. That fails
# silently in exactly the direction this lock exists to close, while the per-user limit
# is stated. What it therefore does NOT cover, and says so in its own lines: CI (a VM per
# job), another machine, another user on this one -- and Git Bash against WSL on one
# Windows box, whose `$HOME`s differ.
#
# **Descendants must not inherit it** -- see `gate_lock_run` for why that makes it
# `flock -o` rather than a descriptor. **A wrapper that already holds it** must not be
# deadlocked against, and `gate_lock_holder` is how that is told apart.

#
# The mode is part of the answer because a lock that excludes nobody is not one this gate
# may call held: two gates under `flock -s` would each be told so and run at once.

#   - options stop at the first non-option (a `+` optstring), so that argument is the file;
#   - `-w` and `-E` take a value, attached (`-w5`, `-Ew`) or next (`-w 5`, `-nw 5`), and a
#     bundle is read letter by letter because the letter after `-E` is `-E`'s VALUE;
#   - a long option may be ABBREVIATED to any unambiguous prefix (`--sh`, `--wai 5`), as

# The MARKER is asked across every ancestor BEFORE any flock is. The gate's own re-exec

# Run a command holding the host's gate lock, and say so when it had to queue.
#
# **`flock -o`, and the `-o` is the design rather than a detail.** It closes the lock's
# descriptor in the command, so only the `flock` process holds the lock and it is released
# when the RUN ends. The obvious alternative -- `exec 9>>lock; flock 9` -- hands the
# descriptor to every descendant, and a daemon that an e2e fixture leaked would then hold
# the gate lock for the life of the machine: every later gate queues for the whole budget
# and refuses, on a tree that is fine. A fixture leaking a daemon is a recorded event here,
# not a hypothetical. The wrapper form `flock <path> bash scripts/local-gate.sh` has that
# exposure today, and running the gate bare is what removes it.
#
# The price, measured rather than assumed: killing the waiting parent ALONE leaves `flock`
# and the run going with the lock still held, so the run finishes unwatched; killing the
# `flock` process ALONE frees the lock while the run it serialised carries on, so a second
# gate can start beside it. Kill the process GROUP -- which Ctrl-C and `timeout` do, and
# which `reap-my-gate.sh` does. A trap cannot close this, for the reason the header gives
# about traps and foreground commands.

# The tests a leg did not run, BY NAME, read out of that leg's own ctest output.
#
# `100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 3543` was the only thing a gate log
# said about tests, and under #1128 it was precisely the line that could not be
# trusted: on Catch2 3.6.0 a case failing exactly four assertions exited 4, every
# registration reads exit 4 as a skip, so ctest scored it `Skipped` and still
# printed that. The correct reading was therefore *check the skipped list* -- and
# the gate carried no skip data at all, so that instruction could not be carried
# out by anybody, and a lane believing it had checked had not (#1130).
#
# **A COUNT is refused as the fix, and that was measured rather than argued.** A
# branch adding a skip guarded on `geteuid() == 0` leaves the tally unchanged on
# an unprivileged gate: the skip never fires, the case runs normally, and a
# reader checking the number sees the familiar figure and concludes correctly FOR
# THE WRONG REASON. One more skip is not my skip, and an unchanged count is not
# an unchanged set. So this reports names.
#
# ## Why it reads ctest's OUTPUT and not `Testing/Temporary/LastTestsDisabled.log`
#
# That file holds the names, is written at no extra cost, and is the obvious
# source. It is also a stale verdict waiting to happen: ctest writes it only when
# something did not run, and does NOT remove or empty it when nothing did.
# Measured, one build directory, consecutive runs:
#
#   a run skipping one test    LastTestsDisabled.log written        17:51:15
#   a run skipping nothing     untouched -- still 17:51:15, still naming that test
#
# So a reader trusting the file after a clean run is handed the PREVIOUS run's
# skips, with nothing in the file to say so. The leg's own ctest output cannot go
# stale that way, because it is produced by the run it describes. It is also
# richer: the file merges every reason under a name that says `Disabled`, while
# ctest labels each entry `(Skipped)`, `(Disabled)` or `(Not Run)`.
#
# ## Three outcomes, not two
#
# "nothing skipped" is a conclusion drawn from the ABSENCE of a block, so
# something that must be PRESENT is asserted first: a ctest run that finished
# always prints its totals line. Text carrying none is reported UNKNOWN rather
# than as nothing-skipped. That is the state this project keeps collapsing -- the
# file was not there and nothing was skipped are not the same fact, and only one
# of them is about the tree.
#
# Entries are matched by SHAPE rather than by reading the block to end of input,
# because ctest prints `The following tests FAILED:` AFTER this block and a
# range-to-EOF would report those failures as skips -- which would be #1128's own
# defect rebuilt inside its remedy.
#
# The pointer is SUPPLEMENTARY and the names are the record: an inlined list is
# read months later, on another machine, after the build tree is gone, which is
# most of when a gate log is read at all. It cannot go stale, because it is
# written by the run it describes. A pointer alone would have cost the whole
# ticket: the log would still carry no skip data, and the reader would still need
# a tree that may not exist.
#
# **The pointer is good only until the next run in that build directory, and that
# is accepted rather than solved.** `LastTest.log` is REWRITTEN every run, so a
# reader returning after any later gate reads a different run's per-test output
# with nothing saying so -- this repository has already lost evidence that way.
# It is still the better of the two to name: `LastTestsDisabled.log` is not
# rewritten at all when nothing was skipped, so it hands back a PREVIOUS run's
# skips after a clean one, which is worse than being overwritten. Being replaced
# is not safety; it is a different failure, and the names above are what carries
# the answer either way.

# Every verdict word ctest prints for a test, and whether the gate's failure
# EXCERPT shows it.
#
# A table because two readers need this vocabulary and they must not be able to
# disagree: this excerpt, and #1159's reconcile against the registered total. Two
# hand-kept lists that drift apart is how one instrument starts describing a
# different run from the other.
#
# **The list is hand-kept, and this is the argument for that rather than an
# admission.** #1158 asks that it be derived from something.
#
# ctest enumerates its verdict WORDS nowhere the gate can read them, so there is
# no source to derive this list from as it stands. But there IS a machine-readable
# route and an earlier version of this comment denied it, which would have been
# refuted by the first person to run `ctest --help`: **`--output-junit <file>`
# exists, it is CMake 3.21+, and this project's floor is 3.28**, so it is
# available on every configuration here.
#
# It is declined, on three grounds rather than on ignorance of it. JUnit's
# per-case vocabulary is NARROWER than the console's -- pass, `<failure>`,
# `<skipped>` -- so the excerpt would name less, not more, and `***Exception`
# versus `***Failed` is the distinction #1158 is about. A side file's ABSENCE is
# ambiguous, where `skip_report` turns on the PRESENCE of a totals line, which is
# the one property separating "finished and skipped nothing" from "killed". And
# reading it means an XML parser with attribute unescaping under bash 3.2.
#
# What closes the omission is not a longer list and not a different format: it is
# the reconcile, which compares a SUM against a total and therefore has no list to
# be incomplete (#1159).
#
# `Exception` is #1158: a segfault is `***Exception`, never `***Failed`, so a leg
# failed by a crash printed a correct verdict and named no test. Measured on a
# real `Linux-gcc-release` log: `grep -c '***Failed'` returned 0 while ctest
# reported 1 test failed.
#
# `Not Run` is here because it was shown EMISSIBLE rather than assumed: Catch2's
# `catch_discover_tests` writes a `<TARGET>_NOT_BUILT-<hash>` sentinel whenever a
# test target was not built, and `PACE_BUILD_TESTCLIENT` and
# `PACE_BUILD_BENCHMARKS` default OFF, so a partial build produces it
# (#1159's measurement). #1158 asked for it to be covered or shown impossible; it
# is covered, because it is not impossible.
#
# `Passed` and `Skipped` are deliberately OUT of the excerpt. Passed would print
# thousands of lines. Skipped is reported by `skip_report` with its own names and
# its own three outcomes, so repeating it here would put the same fact in two
# places with two formats and one of them would go stale.
# Columns: the state's NAME, the text ctest actually prints for it, and whether
# the excerpt shows it.
#
# The printed form is a COLUMN and not a rule applied by each reader, which is the
# correction that makes this table's own claim true. Both readers used to derive
# the marker themselves -- the excerpt always prefixing `***`, the reconcile
# prefixing it except for `Passed` -- so the vocabulary was shared and the
# SPELLING was duplicated. A state whose printed form is not `***<name>`, marked
# `yes`, would have made the excerpt grep for something that matches nothing, with
# no way to notice. `Passed` is already that state; it is simply the one that was
# special-cased rather than tabulated.
# **ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING.** `states_reconcile` classifies each result line by the
# FIRST row whose marker matches, so the starred markers must be tried before
# `Passed`, whose marker is a bare word that also appears inside a test NAME. A
# case called `a lookup some Passed task owns` that FAILS would otherwise be
# counted as passed. `Passed` is therefore last, and moving it changes a verdict
# rather than a listing.
#
# The excerpt pattern is unaffected by this order: it takes only the `yes` rows,
# and `Passed`/`Skipped` are both `no`.

#
# A SUM against the registered total has no list to be incomplete. It fires on ANY
# state outside whatever the summer knows, including one a future ctest or Catch2
# adds. That is the `*)`-arm argument answered rather than restated: you cannot
# enumerate your way out, so compare against a total instead (#1159).
#
# ## Its honest limit, stated here because a reader will otherwise infer more
#
# **This says THAT something is unaccounted for. It never says WHAT.** A run
# holding a crash and a run holding an unbuilt-target sentinel produce the same
# alarm with the same wording. It does not replace the excerpt: that names the
# failing test, this only guarantees that an unlisted state cannot pass silently.
# Its silence is not a claim about which states occurred.
#
# ## Where the total comes from
#
# The DENOMINATOR of ctest's own `<n>/<N> Test #<id>:` prefix, which the same run
# prints on every result line. Not a figure from CMake, not a count of
# registrations, not the summary's `out of N` alone -- the requirement is that the
# total cannot drift out of step with what actually ran, and a number emitted by
# the run beside each result cannot.
#
# ## Why it counts with `grep`, and the honest comparison
#
# EIGHT passes over the log: one for the result lines, one for the total, and one
# per row of the table.
#
# An earlier version of this paragraph said seven, and compared them against a
# bash loop doing six regex tests on each of ~7000 lines -- which is the worst
# alternative available and not the one anybody would propose. The real
# alternative is a single `awk`, and it WINS on speed: measured on a synthetic
# 7001-line, 592 KB ctest log, 9.0 ms against 71 ms for this. Roughly 8x.
#
# The greps stay anyway, and the reason is the table rather than the clock. One
# awk pass would have to carry the state vocabulary inside its own program text,
# where `gate_excerpt_pattern` cannot read it -- and one table both readers take
# from is the whole argument for #1158 and #1159 being one change. The cost of
# keeping it is about 60 ms per call against a test phase this project measures in
# minutes, which is under a tenth of a percent of one leg.
#
# A comparison against a straw alternative is worse than no comparison, because it
# reads as though the choice was measured. This one now names the option that
# actually beats it.
#
# The states are made mutually exclusive by anchoring each verdict to the trailing
# `N.NN sec` through `[^0-9*]*`, which cannot span the `***` of a following marker
# -- so a test whose NAME ends in a verdict word is not counted twice. That is
# driven by a self-test case rather than assumed.

# How many compile edges of a GENERATED build are fronted by a compiler-cache
# launcher: a count, or the word `unknown` when there is no build to read.
#
# A count and not a yes/no, because the number is what makes the refusal
# actionable, and not a `fronted <n>` string either -- that would be a wire format
# between two functions in one file, glued on by the producer and taken apart by
# the consumer, with only the producing end self-tested.
#
# This is the guard, and it is separate from the configure decision above because
# it answers a different question. Passing `-DUSE_COMPILER_CACHE=OFF` is not the
# same fact as no launcher being in effect: `cmake/portable/CompileCache.cmake`
# returns early when `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` was set externally -- by a
# preset, a toolchain file, or an older `-D` -- and leaves it untouched. A gate
# that only passed the flag would have ASKED; this one CHECKS.
#
# `LAUNCHER = ` in `build.ninja` and not a cache entry, because the cache cannot
# answer it: `CompileCache.cmake` sets `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` as an ordinary
# directory-scope variable and never as a cache entry. Reading it back out of
# `CMakeCache.txt` was this fix's first design and would have reported "no
# launcher" against both live gate directories on the machine this was written on,
# which carried 148 and 618 launcher-fronted edges at the time -- a guard that
# cannot fire, inside the fix for a ticket about guards that cannot fire. The
# generated build is the fact; the flag is only the intent. It is also already this
# project's idiom for this exact question: `scripts/launcher-replay-e2e.sh` checks
# the same string from the other side, to prove a launcher IS in use.
#
# `unknown` is its own answer and not folded into a count of zero, because a
# missing `build.ninja` is a state where the question cannot be answered rather
# than one where the answer is good, and a gate that cannot check must not report.
# Zero is a reading; `unknown` is the absence of one.
#
# The whole file is scanned rather than stopped at the first match, and that costs
# nothing worth saving: measured at 22.4ms against a 19.7ms bare `awk` spawn on a
# 1.3MB `build.ninja`, so ~2.7ms is the scan. Stopping early cannot help the only
# path a passing gate takes anyway -- answering zero means reading to EOF.
# `unreadable` is the fourth answer and is not optional. `awk` on a file it cannot
# open exits WITHOUT running its `END` block, so it prints nothing -- and an empty
# string falling through to the caller's default arm would render a failed READING
# as the worst positive one, refusing with "(launcher-fronted edges: )" and blaming
# an external launcher nobody set. Skipped, absent, unstarted and failed are four
# states; a `[[ -f ]]` that passes for a file whose permissions deny it is exactly
# where the fourth hides.
#
# The match is deliberately NOT anchored to ninja's two-space indent. Anchoring
# would fail OPEN if that spelling ever changed -- a count of zero reads as a clean
# build -- and this is a gate, so the loose match is the safe direction: it can
# only over-count. `CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_LAUNCHER` emits the same binding, and a
# linker cache in a reference build is a thing to refuse too.
#
# The number is reported as LAUNCHER BINDINGS, which is what it counts, and NOT as
# edges -- it was called edges and that was a unit error. Ninja emits one `LAUNCHER
# = ` line per RULE where the value is uniform, so a Linux measurement of this tree
# reads **5, covering 501 compile edges**, while #626's Windows reproduction
# recorded **669**. Those two numbers are not comparable and nothing said so. The
# verdict itself is unaffected -- any count above zero refuses -- but a refusal
# message is read by somebody comparing it with another platform, which is the
# whole reason this one exists.

# How many of this tree's headers clang-tidy's header filter would REPORT on
# (#1040), as `<matched>/<total>` -- or one word naming why it could not be asked.
#
# clang-tidy discards a finding in an unmatched header silently, with only a
# `Suppressed NNN warnings (NNN in non-user code)` line to show for it, so a
# filter matching NOTHING and a tree with no header findings render identically.
# Three patterns anchored on the checkout's NAME have now got this wrong, each
# fixed against the layouts its author happened to have; #1040 is the third, and
# it hid because CI's own checkout is the one shape that still matched.
#
# So the question asked here is not "does the pattern look right" but "how many
# of the headers in THIS working tree does it actually cover", which is a
# question a layout nobody has thought of yet still answers.
#
# `grep -E` is POSIX ERE and clang-tidy is `llvm::Regex`, which is a MODEL of the
# tool rather than the tool -- stated because a model more permissive than what
# it stands for produces confident wrong agreement. It is sound for the patterns
# this file has carried (character classes, alternation, `.*`, and a backslash
# inside a bracket, which is literal to both). This gate never checks that against the
# real analyser: it does not run `scripts/tidy-sweep.sh`. That sweep's `HeaderCanary`
# plants a finding in two headers and stops unless clang-tidy itself reports both, but
# clang spells those paths with `/` on Linux, so there it passes under a `/`-only
# pattern too -- the BACKSLASH half is asked of the real analyser only on the
# `clang-tidy-windows` leg. Everywhere else the spellings are `ctest -R
# tidy-header-filter`'s question, asked of this model. This comment used to cite
# `scripts/check-header-filter.sh` for that, and no such script has ever existed in this
# repository. Before the canary the agreement was checked by hand, with clang-tidy
# 22.1.8 on Windows, 2026-09-29: a violation planted in a header under `src/` reported 0
# times under a `/`-only filter and twice under `[/\\]` -- which is also why this
# coverage count, matching POSIX paths only, could not see that defect.

# Put out/build/<preset> where `build_placement` says, and SAY what was decided.
#
# A SYMLINK rather than a path threaded through this script. The build directory is spelled
# exactly once, in `run_preset`, and every later read goes through that spelling -- and CMake
# records the SPELLED path in its cache rather than the resolved one, so `cmake --build
# --preset` and a re-configure both agree with it. Probed, not assumed: configure, build, test,
# re-configure and re-build, all through a 9p-to-ext4 link, all clean. `cmake -B` beside
# `--preset` is the tempting alternative and moves only the configure: the build step reads
# the preset's own `binaryDir`.
#
# Nothing is deleted. An in-tree build an earlier gate left is MOVED aside and named, so its
# space is recovered by a person deciding to rather than by a script deciding for them. A link
# pointing anywhere else is this gate's own earlier placement under another home -- output,
# not input -- so re-pointing it costs one configure and loses nothing.
# @param 1 The preset.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What NEITHER gate configuration can reach
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `LOCAL GATE PASSED` with `3303 tests` beside it reads as coverage, and it is a
# true number comparable to nothing. #877: a required CI leg went red on a change
# this gate had passed, and the check that failed -- `tidy-blind-spots` -- **could
# not have run here at all**. It registers only under ASan AND
# `PACE_ENABLE_TLS`, and `gate-clang-debug` has the first and not the second.
# Nothing was broken and nobody made a mistake; the gate simply cannot reach it and
# said nothing about that. The same lane had already read `17 tests, 100% passed`
# as covering the check earlier that session. It was ABSENT, not passing, and the
# two render identically in a total.
#
# This is `AGENT.md`'s own rule -- *a ctest total is comparable only against the
# same tree, the same platform AND the same target set* -- for CONFIGURATION rather
# than target set, and worse in one respect: a target set is visible in the
# configure line somebody typed, while a feature flag gating a test REGISTRATION is
# visible nowhere the reader of `LOCAL GATE PASSED` is looking.
#
# **The answer is not "run everything".** Some configurations are legitimately
# expensive or platform-bound, and whether to add a gate configuration is a
# separate decision this deliberately does not make. Naming the gap is what makes
# that decision possible.
#
# DERIVED BY WALKING REGISTRATIONS, never a maintained list. A restated list is
# exact about what it knows and silent about what arrives (#492), and the arriving
# case is precisely the one this exists for -- a test added tomorrow under a flag
# no gate preset sets.
#
# **It must never call `fail`.** The block that prints it runs on BOTH terminal
# paths, and one of them is `fail` itself; refusing from inside it would be
# re-entrant. So it prints its refusal and returns non-zero, and the GREEN path is
# what turns that into a verdict. A red run is already red and needs no second one.

# The CMake sources that may register a test.
#
# A LANGUAGE rule rather than a file list: a `.sh` cannot register a ctest test, so
# the three non-CMake files whose text contains `add_test(` are excluded by what
# they are rather than by being named -- `check-run-check-coverage.sh` and
# `doc-subject-checks.sh` SCAN for the pattern and
# `check-target-file-guards-selftest.cmake` STAGES it into synthetic trees. A file
# that merely matches a scan is not a call site, and a list of today's three
# exceptions would be blind to tomorrow's fourth.
#
# `scripts/*.cmake` is excluded for the same reason and it is not an oversight:
# those run under `cmake -P`, which has no test registry to add to.
#
# GIT is the enumerator, so an unreadable work tree yields NOTHING -- which is a
# refusal below rather than a clean answer. That is not hypothetical here: a linked
# worktree whose `.git` file holds an ABSOLUTE `gitdir:` is unreadable to the other
# git on this machine, which is #1064 and #336, and it presents as every command
# listing zero files.
#
# The third-party roots of the tree in the working directory are excluded because this
# build never reads those files: a vendored tree may carry upstream's own CMakeLists,
# which this build does not use. The vendored endo TUI's did (#1596 removed it), and one
# of them registered `add_test(NAME test-tui ...)`; counting a registration from a file no
# build processes puts a permanently unclosable row in this derivation -- worse than a
# red, because a line that can never be cleared is a line that stops being read. What is
# declined is named on stderr; stdout is the list. A roots file that cannot be read
# yields NOTHING, which every caller already refuses or reports as skipped.

# A pure function of the list so `--self-test` drives the same code the run uses;
# the alternative is a guard tested nowhere, which is the shape this file exists to
# refuse.
#
# It exists because an EMPTY list is not a formatted tree. `git ls-files | xargs
# clang-format -i` hands the formatter no operands, GNU xargs runs it anyway, and
# clang-format reads stdin and answers `error: cannot use -i when reading from
# stdin` -- so the gate reported `GATE FAILED: clang-format` for a tree whose
# formatting it had never examined. Measured on GNU findutils 4.9.0: empty input
# with no `-r` RUNS the command with no arguments, and the real pipeline exits
# **123**, which is xargs's "the utility exited non-zero" and neither 0 nor 1.
#
# The observed cause was a linked worktree whose `.git` file held an ABSOLUTE
# `gitdir:`: the other git could not resolve it and listed nothing, where the same
# tree listed 395 files once the pointer was relative (#1064).
#
# NOT `xargs -r`. That fixes the symptom in the wrong direction -- an empty list
# would become a silent PASS, the gate announcing it had formatted a tree it never
# read. The guard is on the LIST, so both xargs dialects refuse identically and the
# verdict does not depend on which platform the developer is standing on.

# The reader for the exit contract `SKIP_RETURN_CODE 4` rests on.
#
# Every `catch_discover_tests` registration in this tree tells ctest that exit 4 means
# SKIPPED (`check-catch-skip-return-code`). That is exact only under a contract Catch2 has
# kept since 3.7.1: a run whose every case skipped exits 4, and ANY assertion failure exits
# one fixed value whatever the count. Before 3.7.1 the exit code WAS the failed-assertion
# count, so a case failing exactly four assertions exited 4 and ctest scored it *skipped*
# (#1128), and no rule in this tree could see it. So the contract is asserted HERE, against
# the Catch2 the tree actually links, by running each shape of `src/tests/CatchSkipCanary.cpp`
# in its own process -- the way `catch_discover_tests` runs a case -- and reading its status:
#
#   1. every SKIP-ONLY shape exits 4: a bare skip, a skip after a padded and a twice-padded
#      summary column, a skip in a later section after earlier ones ran;
#   2. every shape carrying ANY failure exits ONE value, the same for all of them, that is
#      neither 0 nor 4: one failure, four (the old collision), three hundred (past the old
#      255 clamp), a skip beside four failures, and the two that echo a skip's text;
#   3. a passing case exits 0, so a binary exiting non-zero for everything is a broken
#      canary rather than a contract that holds.
#
# The failure code is not asserted to be 42. What `SKIP_RETURN_CODE 4` needs is that a
# failure cannot spell 4 and does not move with the count; the canary's `static_assert`s pin
# 4 and the failure code against `catch2/catch_session.hpp` at compile time, and reading
# those constants here would mean finding the header of whichever route `find_package` took,
# a second way to be wrong about which Catch2 is linked.
#
# **A red here is a DISCOVERY, not a defect in the tree.** It means the linked Catch2 no
# longer keeps the contract -- most likely a different Catch2 than the exact pin names,
# reached through another route -- and every Catch2 verdict in the run is suspect until it
# is understood. It is not a reason to edit this file until it passes.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DCANARY=<path> -P scripts/check-catch-skip-exit-contract.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

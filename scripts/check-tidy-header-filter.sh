# clang-tidy's HeaderFilterRegex takes every tracked first-party header however the path to it
# is SPELLED -- forward slashes, backslashes, and the mix an MSVC build produces -- at the root
# this checkout actually lives at, and reaches no dependency and no third-party header in any
# spelling.
#
# ## Why
#
# clang-tidy matches the filter against the path it opened a header by, and on Windows that
# path is not the POSIX one: the MSVC compile database carries its include directories with
# backslashes (`-ID:\...\src`), so `#include <tests/ScratchPath.hpp>` opens
# `D:\...\src/tests/ScratchPath.hpp`. `.clang-tidy` spelled every separator `/`, and measured
# with clang-tidy 22.1.8 on Windows, a naming violation planted in a header under `src/tests/`
# was reported 0 times under it and twice under a filter accepting either separator. Every
# header finding on a Windows tidy run was discarded, and the run still looked healthy because
# the main file's findings came through.
#
# The predicate and the table of spellings are `scripts/lib/header-filter.sh`, which
# `local-gate.sh`'s coverage check -- the tidy sweep's precondition -- shares. This is the same
# question asked from `ctest`, which runs on every platform, Windows included, where the gate
# does not. It asks at the REAL root because where a checkout lives is the other dimension
# that has shipped a defect (#1040), and at synthetic roots in `--self-test`, where the answer
# must not depend on the machine.
#
# ## Modes
#
#   bash scripts/check-tidy-header-filter.sh              the configured filter, this checkout
#   bash scripts/check-tidy-header-filter.sh --self-test  the judgement, over planted filters
#
# bash 3.2: no mapfile, no declare -A. Invoke as `bash <path>`, never bare.

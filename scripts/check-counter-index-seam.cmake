# A `IMetricsSink::Counter` becomes an index in exactly one place, and this is what
# makes that a fact rather than a sentence (#1366).
#
# What an index at or past `Counter::Last` MEANS is stated once, on
# `IMetricsSink::Carries`, and not here. What this enforces is narrower: that every
# table keyed by the enum reaches its rows through `CounterIndex`
# (`Metrics/IMetricsSink.hpp`) -- directly, or through `CounterCells::Find`, which
# is built on it -- rather than through a cast written at the call site. A cast
# like that compiles, reads exactly like the converter, and carries none of its
# answer for a counter this build has no row for.
#
# Half of the rule is the TYPE, and this is the other half. `CounterCells` has no
# integer subscript, so a table of that type cannot be indexed by a cast at all --
# which is what covers a cast whose operand is a template parameter or an alias,
# because no text scan can see what type an identifier has. What only a scan can
# see is a NEW table keyed by the enum that is not a `CounterCells`: a
# `std::array` indexed by `static_cast<std::size_t>(counter)`, which is an ordinary
# cast no compiler remarks on.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`, for the reason check-net-boundary.cmake states. Its
# registration carries `FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`, and that property rather than the
# exit code is the verdict (`scripts/check-script-check-signals.cmake`, #565).
#
# **It fails when its own scan matches nothing**, and when an allowed file converts
# a different number of times than its row says: fewer is a stale row vouching for a
# conversion that has moved, more is a second conversion hiding in the one file
# allowed to hold the first.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-counter-index-seam.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = one converter. 1 = a second one has appeared. (But read the
# OUTPUT, not the code -- see above.)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What counts as converting a counter.
#
# A `static_cast` or `std::to_underlying` whose parenthesised operand names `counter`
# or `Counter` as a word ending there -- `counter`, `row.counter`,
# `IMetricsSink::Counter::Last`, `NodeCounter::WorkerJobsCompleted`. The operand is the
# BALANCED parenthesised expression the cast opens, walked character by character
# (`pace_casts_a_counter`), so a name AFTER the cast's closing parenthesis is not
# its operand: `Table[static_cast<std::size_t>(outcome)].counter` casts an outcome, and a
# scan that read it as a counter conversion OVERSTATED what is wrong -- the same defect as
# understating it, and the one this check shipped with until a caller met it.
# Stated with its limits rather than implied:
#
#   - an operand spelled otherwise (`Row`, `c`, an alias) is NOT seen; `CounterCells`
#     is what covers that, by having no integer subscript;
#   - the reverse direction, an integer made into a `Counter`, is NOT this rule;
#   - `counters` (a plural, a different name) is not a match, and neither is a
#     `Counter` that appears BEFORE the cast on the line;
#   - the scan reads one line at a time, so an operand that continues onto the next
#     line is NOT seen; an operand not closed on its line runs to the next `;` or the
#     line's end, which is wider than exact and fails closed for what IS on the line;
#   - the walk counts parentheses as characters and knows no literal, so a `)` inside a
#     character or string literal ends the operand early. That fails OPEN: in
#     `static_cast<std::size_t>(Parse(')') + counter)` the operand is read as
#     `Parse('`, the counter after it is not seen, and the conversion is ACCEPTED. A `(`
#     inside a literal fails the other way, running the operand on to the `;`. Neither
#     shape exists in this tree; the direction is stated so nobody has to re-derive it.
#
# The regex below is the cheap first pass, and it is WIDER than the rule: its operand
# runs to the next `;`. Only a line it matches is walked.
#
# Full-line and trailing `//` comments are stripped first, so prose that spells the
# cast in backticks is not a violation: a check that failed on the reasoning would
# make the reasoning unwritable.

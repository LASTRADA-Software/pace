# A unit compiled against a different `IMetricsSink::Counter` must FAIL TO LINK, and this
# builds one to watch it fail (#1361).
#
# Every table keyed by the enum is sized by `Counter::Last`, so a build linking objects
# compiled against two versions of the enum disagrees about those extents -- an ODR
# violation that nothing at run time can be sound against, and that has already happened
# in this tree (#1332: a unit compiled before seven counters were added, a counter dropped
# and a zero reported). `Metrics/IMetricsSink.hpp` makes every including unit ask, at static
# initialisation, for `CounterSkew::RequireExtent` at ITS count, and
# `Metrics/IMetricsSink.cpp` defines it for one count only.
#
# No single-TU test can observe any of that, and a guard nobody has watched refuse is not
# known to work -- the mechanism's whole claim is about what a LINKER keeps, which is a
# claim about a tool. So this builds a fixture project with THIS build's compiler and
# generator:
#
#   control -- a unit against a byte-identical copy of the header, plus the real definition:
#              must LINK. A guard that refused everything would pass the next step alone.
#   skewed  -- the same, plus a unit against a copy with one enumerator inserted before
#              `Last`: must FAIL, with `RequireExtent` in the output, and only after
#              the skewed unit COMPILED -- a compile error would satisfy "the build failed"
#              for a reason that has nothing to do with the linker.
#
# In Debug AND Release, because the optimiser is where a reference that looks load-bearing
# disappears -- measured, and recorded beside the guard in the header: an `inline` shape and
# an uncalled reference each LINKED a skewed unit on at least one compiler. The header's own
# comment says why the call site is a `static` initializer; this is what checks it.
#
# Every source the fixture compiles is a COPY taken into the scratch directory, so a
# selftest can hand this script a tree whose header has the guard removed and watch it
# refuse -- and the copies are asserted byte-identical to the tree's.
#
# Usage:

#         -P scripts/check-counter-extent-link.cmake
#
# Verdict from the OUTPUT (`FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`), as every `cmake -P` check here
# (`scripts/check-script-check-signals.cmake`). `SKIP: ` when the fixture cannot configure in
# this environment at all -- a Windows shell that is not a Developer shell has a `cl.exe`
# that exists and cannot compile.

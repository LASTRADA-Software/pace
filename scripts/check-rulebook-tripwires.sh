# Every `##` section of a rulebook file says whether it has a tripwire in
# `AGENT.md`, and names the phrase (#876).
#
# `AGENT.md` states the rule this enforces, from both sides:
#
#   "a rule landed in `.agent/rules/` without a bullet here fires in no session
#    that does not open its file -- which is the population the rule was written
#    for. It has shipped that way (#355), caught by a review rather than by the
#    author, and the reason it is easy is that writing the rule feels like the
#    work."
#
# ## Why the marker, and why not the thing the ticket asked for
#
# #876 asks for a check that a rulebook ENTRY has an `AGENT.md` tripwire, and
# its acceptance clause is refuted by `.agent/rules/README.md`, which worked the
# design out and recorded it rather than building it. Three findings stand, and
# each one kills a cheaper design:
#
#   * **The correspondence cannot be heading text.** README worked example is a
#     heading and a tripwire that state the same fact with no matchable text
#     between them. Any fuzzy ruler refuses correct entries and misses incorrect
#     ones -- which is the ticket own objection to a threaded-source census,
#     turned on the ticket.
#   * **A tripwire may live under ANOTHER file link, and may be a nested
#     bullet.** `compile-cache.md` "Two servers on one wire are two VERSIONS on
#     one wire" is tripwired as a sub-bullet under **`distributed-compilation.md`**,
#     correctly, because the rule spans both. So "a bullet under that file link"
#     would refuse a correct tree, and any reader keyed on a top-level `^- `
#     misses it silently. **That is why the phrase is searched over the WHOLE of
#     `AGENT.md`** rather than inside the file own section.
#   * **The rulebook own rule is CONDITIONAL.** README "Adding a rule" says to
#     add a tripwire *if the rule is one a reader could plausibly break without
#     noticing*. A check written to #876 acceptance clause would refuse entries
#     the rulebook says need no tripwire.
#
# So the claim travels in a MARKER the author writes, and the check verifies the
# claim rather than inventing the correspondence. That makes *yes* a statement
# somebody can be WRONG about instead of a box ticked: the phrase either is in
# `AGENT.md` or it is not.
#
# ## The marker is MANDATORY, and `none` is how a section opts out
#
# Not opt-in. An opt-in marker is exact about the sections it knows and silent
# about the ones it does not, and silence reads identically to complete coverage
# (#492). This is `check-table-totals.sh` `table-total: none` idiom one file
# over, and the `Refuse` / `RefuseWithoutCounter` idiom from
# `.agent/rules/metrics-and-observability.md` arriving in markdown: *deliberately
# untripwired must not be spelled like forgot*. A section with no tripwire says
# so and says WHY, which costs one line and buys the property that a section
# ARRIVING cannot join the tree unchecked.
#
#   <!-- agent-tripwire: a phrase that appears in AGENT.md -->
#   <!-- agent-tripwire: none: why this section needs no tripwire -->
#   <!-- agent-tripwire: untriaged: #123 nobody has decided about this one yet -->
#
# One LINE each, and outside any fenced block: a marker split over two lines is
# read to the break and refused by name, and a marker shown as an EXAMPLE inside a
# ``` block does not answer for the section above it.
#
# THREE spellings, three claims, because two cannot carry this: a rise in the
# first means the tripwire moved, `none` says *a rise would mean nothing, and
# why*, and `untriaged` says *nobody has decided, and which issue will*. That is
# the `Refuse` / `RefuseWithoutCounter` / `RefuseUntriaged` split from
# `.agent/rules/metrics-and-observability.md`, and the reason it is safe to have
# a third at all is the same reason it is safe there: **the check TALLIES the
# untriaged ones and prints the total per issue on every run**, so a placeholder
# cannot spell *forgot* in the vocabulary of *decided*. An `untriaged` marker
# must name an issue, or it is a backlog row with no owner.
#
# This spelling exists because the first seeding of these markers found sections
# with no `AGENT.md` tripwire at all -- #876 premise, confirmed on its first run.
# Spelling those `none:` would have recorded *this section needs no tripwire* for
# rules that need one. The COUNT is not written here: the check prints it, per
# issue, on every run, which is the one place it cannot drift. (It was written
# here, as "eight", and disagreed with the ctest registration's "seven" and with
# the live run before this sentence replaced it.)
#
# The marker carries no line number and no AGENT.md coordinate, deliberately:
# `AGENT.md` is several hundred bullets that several sessions edit at once, and
# a coordinate would be stale on arrival. A PHRASE survives everything except
# the tripwire being reworded or deleted, which are the two events worth hearing
# about.
#
# `AGENT.md` is only ever READ. That is the property that makes this affordable
# at all -- nothing here edits the file every session loads first.
#
# ## What this check does NOT cover, stated because a reader will over-apply it
#
#   * It does not decide whether the phrase is the RIGHT tripwire for the
#     section. It checks that the phrase the author nominated is present. A
#     marker quoting a real sentence about an unrelated rule passes.
#   * It does not check the reverse direction -- an `AGENT.md` bullet with no
#     rules-file section behind it is not refused. AGENT.md carries tripwires for
#     rules that live in source comments and in `.agent/guides/`, so that
#     direction has no denominator.
#   * It does not read `## Open work` or `## Accepted trade-offs` as rules. They
#     are sections of a rulebook file like any other and need a marker like any
#     other, and the honest answer for them is `none:`.
#   * It says nothing about a rule that is in neither file.
#
# ## Matching
#
# The haystack is `AGENT.md` flattened to one whitespace-normalised line with
# `*`, backtick and `_` removed; the needle is normalised the same way. Both
# halves matter and both have already been a bug in this repository:
#
#   * **Flattening**, because `AGENT.md` is hard-wrapped and a phrase WRAPPED
#     ACROSS A LINE reading as absent is a row of the table `check-table-totals`
#     exists to protect, and `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` carries the
#     same finding against CMake own wrapped diagnostics.
#   * **Markup stripping**, because these bullets are dense with `**bold**` and
#     backticks and somebody bolding half a phrase must not break a correct
#     marker. `check-table-totals.sh` strips exactly this set for exactly this
#     reason.
#
# A phrase shorter than MinPhraseWords words is REFUSED. Without a floor the
# marker degrades into the box-tick this design exists to avoid: "the" appears
# in `AGENT.md` and proves nothing.
#
# Scope is `.agent/rules/*.md`, README included. Excluding README by name would
# be an exclusion list -- a bet on the directory layout -- where five `none:`
# markers state the same thing and cannot go stale. Nothing under `.agent/` is
# vendored, so `third-party-roots` has no question to answer here;
# `check-table-totals.sh` sets that precedent one file over.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-rulebook-tripwires.sh [<repo-root>]
#   bash scripts/check-rulebook-tripwires.sh --self-test
#
# Exit: 0 clean, 1 a rule was broken, 2 usage.

# heading, and which heading it belongs to stops being obvious.

# so a `-->` on the next line means everything past the break is dropped -- and
# that is refused by name rather than tolerated, because the silent half of it

# `tsan-binaries` must be SEEN to refuse, on each thing it claims and on nothing
# else -- and to ACCEPT, which is the direction a guard is not known to work in
# until somebody has watched it. #1031 is two days of a gate failing CLOSED and
# unconditionally with a confidently worded false cause, and its `none` arm had
# on the evidence never once been observed answering.
#
# `tsan-binaries` runs the check against THIS tree, where a green run is equally
# consistent with the check working and with it having quietly stopped reading:
# the whole subject is a binary nobody noticed, so a reader that matches nothing
# reports exactly the same clean line as a tree with nothing to report.
#
# ## The trees are staged FROM the check, never from a copy of it
#
# This file `include()`s `check-tsan-binaries.cmake` with
# `FastCachedTsanBinariesDefinitionsOnly` set, which returns before the scan, and
# stages one registration per row of the gate's own `TARGETS` table and one per
# row of the check's own exemption list. So a row added to either is a row this
# file stages, and no list here can drift from the shipped one -- a second list
# is not a cross-check, it is a second thing to be wrong, and one that had drifted
# would agree with itself perfectly on every run.
#
# ## The verdict is the OUTPUT, and it is FLATTENED first
#
# `message(WARNING)` exits 0 on every CMake while printing a diagnostic, so a
# check that merely warned would pass an exit-code test. And CMake WRAPS a
# diagnostic at about 74 columns, so a phrase can exist in the output and in no
# single LINE of it. Every expectation here is matched against flattened text.
#
# ## A spawn that never RAN is not a verdict
#
# `execute_process` reports a failure to LAUNCH as a STRING rather than a number,
# and a discarded `RESULT_VARIABLE` reads that as the check having answered --
# every `refuse` arm then passes and every `pass` arm fails, which presents as a
# rule regression and sends the next reader hunting a defect that is not there
# (#747, on `check-net-boundary-selftest`). It is INCONCLUSIVE here and says so.
#

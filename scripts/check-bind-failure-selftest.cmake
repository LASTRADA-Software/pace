# `bind-failure-seam` must be seen to fail, in each of the four ways it can.
#
# The check it drives is the CODE half of
# [#352](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/352). The table half
# is a `static_assert` and needs no selftest: a row omitting the column does not
# compile, which is a fact anyone can verify by trying it. The code half is a source
# scan, and a source scan that has never been watched refuse is indistinguishable
# from one that matches nothing -- which is the exact defect it was written to close.
#
# So this drives the real check against SYNTHETIC trees and asserts each verdict
# separately. Not `WILL_FAIL`, which says only "something came back red": a check
# that stopped refusing and a check that started refusing everything are opposite
# defects, and a bare inversion reports them identically. **A classifier that cannot
# be made to say every one of its verdicts has not been shown to classify anything.**
#
# The trees are built here rather than kept in the repository, because a fixture
# containing an opener that bypasses the seam would be a violation of the rule under
# test, and excluding it would put a hole in the thing being proved.
#
# ## Why `cmake -P` and not a shell script
#
# A hygiene script `ctest` runs is constrained to bash 3.2 -- macOS ships a 2007
# `/bin/bash` -- and `producer | grep -q` is a false NEGATIVE under `pipefail` on the
# SUCCESS path. Staying in CMake means neither applies rather than surviving both.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DFASTCACHED_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-bind-failure-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

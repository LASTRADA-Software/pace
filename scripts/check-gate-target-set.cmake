#
# The local gate turns on the same default-OFF targets CI does, so its `ctest`
# total describes the same target set.
#
# ## Why this exists (#1144, #1197)
#
# A ctest total is comparable only against the same tree, the same platform AND
# the same target set. `PACE_BUILD_TESTCLIENT` and
# `PACE_BUILD_BENCHMARKS` default OFF, so one commit on one platform gives
# two different totals depending only on which `-D` flags were passed -- and the
# smaller number does not look wrong, the tree just looks smaller.
#
# #1144 fixed that by turning the flags on in `scripts/local-gate.sh` and keeping
# them in a `gate_target_flags` table, because the failure it guards against is a
# THIRD such target arriving and nobody noticing: `src/apps/CMakeLists.txt` gates
# each executable on a table row, so adding one is adding a row, and a target that
# defaults OFF is invisible to the gate rather than absent from CI.
#
# **That fix's own comment cited `ctest -R gate-target-set` as already refusing the
# drift, and no such test existed anywhere in the tree.** The claim was removed
# rather than left standing -- a comment asserting what nothing checks cannot fail
# -- and this is the check it named.
#
# ## Both sides are DERIVED
#
# The gate's set is read from `gate_target_flags` in `scripts/local-gate.sh` and
# CI's from the `-D` flags in `.github/workflows/build.yml`. Restating either here
# would make this a second thing to be wrong rather than a cross-check, and one
# that had drifted would agree with itself perfectly on every run.
#
# A third derivation catches the failure neither set can see on its own: a flag
# NAME that gates nothing. A misspelled `-DPACE_BUILD_BENCHMARK=ON` sets an
# unused cache variable, changes no target, and fails nothing -- so every option
# named on either side must be one this project declares, read from the
# `PACE_APPS` table and the root `option()` calls.
#
# ## What this deliberately does NOT model
#
# WHICH jobs run ctest. CI's side is every `PACE_BUILD_*` flag the workflow
# turns ON, wherever it appears, because deriving "this job runs tests" from the
# YAML is fragile in the direction that fails SILENT. The cost is stated rather
# than hidden: if a job ever turns one of these on without running tests, this
# check refuses and the fix is to decide deliberately -- either the gate matches
# it or the row is exempted with a reason. Refusing where the answer is unclear is
# the direction this repository has already chosen for `ci-scope.sh`.
#
# A flag turned OFF is not read. `-DPACE_BUILD_TESTS=OFF` in the packaging
# jobs turns the whole suite off, which is a different question from which
# optional TARGETS a suite covers, and folding the two would be a state collapse
# in the check written to prevent one.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-gate-target-set.cmake
#
# Exit: the verdict is the OUTPUT, not the status -- read through
# `FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`, because a `-P` script that merely WARNS exits 0.

# `file(READ)` and a walk by offset, never `file(STRINGS)`: that returns a LIST,

# be counted as a live one. A workflow file is full of `[` (`runs-on`, matrix

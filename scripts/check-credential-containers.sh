# Key material must live in a container that zeroes its storage.
#
# #324 was six holders of one secret -- the cluster's pre-shared key, retired since (#178) -- every one of them a plain `std::vector<std::byte>`
# that freed the bytes without touching them. Fixing the six is not the same as fixing
# the defect: a seventh holder is one declaration away, it looks exactly like the six
# did, and nothing about a plain vector reports that it is holding key material. This is
# the scan that makes the seventh visible.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated rather than implied. It reads NAMES. A credential declared
# under a name this table does not carry is invisible to it, and no scan over identifiers
# can be otherwise -- a cache is full of variables called `key` that hold nothing secret,
# so a vocabulary wide enough to catch every credential would refuse most of the tree. So
# the table is the claim: these identifiers denote key material, and each one is
# required to still MATCH something, because a term that has quietly stopped matching is a
# guard that has quietly stopped guarding and reads identically to a clean tree (#492).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-credential-containers.sh [--root <dir>]
#   bash scripts/check-credential-containers.sh --self-test

# `--root` is parsed in the long form for two reasons, both measured rather than foreseen.
#
#   - `shift 2` with one argument left SHIFTS NOTHING and returns 1. With `set -e` off --
#     which it is, deliberately, four lines above -- the loop re-reads `--root` forever.
#     `bash scripts/check-credential-containers.sh --root` never terminated. Under ctest
#     that is a TIMEOUT, and a timeout is not a verdict about the tree: a hang here and a
#     stalled runner are indistinguishable, which is the state collapse `run-check.sh`
#     exists to prevent, reintroduced in the argument parser.
#   - `Root="${2:-}"` made "no --root" and "--root with an empty value" the same state, so
#     an empty one fell through to the default tree below and reported `ok` over THIS
#     repository's `src/`. A caller whose `$(...)` came back empty was told its own tree
#     was clean. Provenance, not a value test: `RootGiven` is what the default consults.

machineTicket|a minted machine ticket: a bearer credential, signed by the identity key of this machine, until it expires (Distributed/MachineTicket)
secret|the text credential a client presents: Cc::Credential::secret in the launcher and the node, and Credential::secret in pacectl (#1125, #1578)
'
# The rows are the per-node identity's (#178): the table's claim is "these names hold key
# material", and a node's signing key and a session's derived keys are exactly that. Each name is
# held by the Core crypto seam today and matched there, so a rename in `Core/Ed25519`,
# `Core/X25519` or `Core/Hkdf` is a refusal here.
#
# `presharedKey` and `clusterKey` were rows for the cluster's pre-shared key, and each went with
# its last holder rather than being kept as a comment -- a row that matches nothing is a refusal
# here (case 3). `presharedKey` went at #178 PR 4, when discovery stopped reading the key;
# `clusterKey` at #178 PR 6, when the node proof became a signature under each node's own key and
# the pre-shared key left the tree altogether.
#
# A bare `key` still cannot be a row. This is a cache: `key` is the thing being cached in
# most of the tree, so that row would refuse hundreds of correct declarations, and a guard
# that has to be suppressed everywhere is one somebody deletes. That is what forced the
# RENAME rather than a wider vocabulary -- the holder is named for what it holds.
#
# `_secret` and `requirePass` are #1125's rows: the TEXT credentials, where the container is
# `SecureString` rather than `SecureByteBuffer`. `\b`-anchored as everything here is, so
# `_secret` does not reach `_secretKey` and `requirePass` does not reach
# `requirePassExplicit` -- which is a provenance BIT and holds no secret.
#
# `secret` is a row since both of its holders are `SecureString`: `Cc::Credential::secret`
# (`apps/pace-cc/CacheProtocol.hpp`) since the launcher began presenting machine tickets,
# and `pacectl`'s own `Credential::secret` since its node verbs began presenting them too.
# What the row cannot reach is the one plain copy a wire needs spelled out, made where it is sent
# and named for something else: the RESP `AUTH` vector `SocketExchange.cpp` encodes. That residue
# is #1578. (The admin surface is sent no credential at all, so no bearer copy exists.) **That vector is NAMED `argv` and is not a process
# argument list** -- `pacectl` spawns no process at all, and it is written here because
# the name produced exactly that misreading once.
#
# TWO names were considered for #1125 and are deliberately NOT rows, each for a different
# reason, because an omission that looks like an oversight gets 'fixed' into a refusal
# nobody can satisfy:
#
#   `dashboardToken`
#             -- a real wall, and the reason differs: `Protocol/CompileCacheWire.hpp` is
#                header-only because the launcher does not LINK `Pace`, and
#                `SecureBytes.hpp` needs `SecureBytes.cpp` for `SecureZero`.
#   `token`   -- far too broad: `PathCanon`'s parser, `CpuFeatures`' banner reader and a
#                lease's public identifier all spell it, and none is key material. This is
#                the `key` argument again.
#
# Where those secrets LAND is therefore still plain storage in places, and that is a stated
# boundary rather than a gap this table forgot -- `pacectl`'s `main.cpp` says where.
#
# A MINTED TICKET leaves `SecureString` exactly once, and on purpose: MINT-TICKET's `Ok`
# reply IS the ticket, so `EncodeReply` copies it into the plain reply vector the endpoint
# writes and then frees without a wipe. The wire carries the ticket anyway, and a reply
# buffer is no declaration a name can reach -- a stated boundary, not a missed holder.
#
# And a holder spelled `auto` is INVISIBLE here, in the open direction: the type is read
# from the spelling immediately before the name, so `auto const machineTicket = ...` reads
# as clean whatever it holds. That is why the minter spells `SecureString const
# machineTicket` out (`SessionResponder.cpp`); the scan cannot demand it.

# Types that OWN bytes. A borrowing view (`std::span`, `BytesView`, `std::string_view`)
# is deliberately absent: it owns no storage, so there is nothing for it to zero, and
# demanding a secure type of a view would refuse every correct boundary in the tree.
#
# Each row is an extended regular expression, matched immediately before the identifier. The
# `std::array` row is the one that needs to be: a fixed-size array is the obvious spelling of a
# 32-byte key -- this tree's PUBLIC keys are exactly that -- and it is never zeroed when it dies,
# so a secret spelled like its public half is the declaration most likely to be written next (#178).

# Three processes became one, which is worth less than it sounds and is kept for the

# Three introducers, not two: `//`, a `/*` OPENING a block, and a `*` continuing one. The
# opener was missing, so a one-line `/* ... std::string requirePass; ... */` was read as
# code and reported as a violation -- the FALSE-POSITIVE direction, which case 6 below
# already names as the one that gets acted on, because a finding looks like work. #1125
# widened the exposure rather than creating it: `requirePass` and `_secret` are spelled in
# explanatory prose all over this tree, where `pseudoRandomKey` never is.
#
# WHAT IS STILL NOT COVERED, and it is a property of every regex-shaped reader here: the
# INTERIOR of a block comment whose lines begin with neither `*` nor `//` is read as code.
# This tree's style puts a `*` on continuation lines, so the residue is narrow, and a prose
# line has to look like a DECLARATION to produce a finding at all. Stated because a reader
# who takes "comments are stripped" literally will over-trust it.
#
# And the identifiers are matched in the SAME awk, one process per file: each code line that
# names an identifier as a whole word comes out as `<identifier index>:<line>:<text>`, grouped
# by identifier in table order and in line order within one -- the order the per-identifier
# `grep` this replaced produced them in. That grep was one fork and one spawn per (file,
# identifier), 13 identifiers over every candidate file; with the per-(mention, type) grep
# below, it took this check from 16 s on master to 79 s on one Git Bash host, and past the
# ARM64 leg's TIMEOUT. POSIX awk has no `\b`, so a whole word is bounded by a non-word
# character or the line's ends.
#
# The identifiers arrive through the ENVIRONMENT, never `-v`: macOS's awk (the one true awk)
# refuses a `-v` value holding a newline ("newline in string"), and the list is one identifier
# per line -- which took this check and its self-test red on the macOS leg only.

# Decide which jobs of a finished `merge_group` run nobody was told about.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci-merge-group-report.sh <event> <runUrl> <jobsTsv> [headBranch]
#
# `<jobsTsv>` is one job per line, `name<TAB>status<TAB>conclusion<TAB>url`,
# which is what `gh api .../actions/runs/<id>/jobs --jq` produces. Prints one
# reportable failure per line on stdout as `context<TAB>conclusion<TAB>url`;
# narrates on stderr; exits 0 when it DECIDED and 1 when it could not.
#
# ## The failure this exists for, measured rather than argued
#
# A merge group whose only failing job is not one of the REQUIRED contexts is
# invisible to every surface anybody looks at. The pull request page is green
# (its own run passed on the head), the queue reports success (every required
# context passed), master is green afterwards (the same job passes on the merge
# commit), and the only trace is an `event=merge_group` run that no part of the
# normal flow ever lists.
#
# Measured on 2026-09-04, over every failing `merge_group` `Build` run the API
# still held -- six of them:
#
#   | run         | failing job          | required? | pull request                |
#   |-------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
#   | 33783939363 | Code coverage        | no        | #689 merged                 |
#   | 33782559943 | macOS-clang-release  | YES       | #686 ejected, fixed, merged |
#   | 33760836218 | Windows-cl-debug     | no        | #667 merged                 |
#   | 33749317968 | Package (macOS .pkg) | no        | #669 merged                 |
#   | 33665118078 | Package (macOS .pkg) | no        | #546 merged                 |

#
# Five of six, four distinct jobs, five pull requests merged with nobody told.
# The one required failure behaved correctly -- ejected, fixed, re-queued -- and
# that contrast is what makes the other five a REPORTING gap rather than a gating
# one. Nothing here proposes changing which contexts are required; #684 is
# explicit that the packaging jobs are unrequired for good reasons.
#
# `Windows-cl-debug` is why this classifies by CONTEXT and never by job key: it
# is a leg of the same matrix job as `Windows-cl-release`, which IS required. The
# unit that is required or not is the expanded name, so that is the unit here.
#
# ## A push to master is the SECOND door, and it needed no new trigger
#
# [#774](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/774): a job failing
# on a push to master reaches nobody by the same mechanism. Master `dd4633b2` had
# `Package (Linux .deb/.rpm)` and `Package (macOS .pkg)` red and it was found by a
# human looking.
#
# The `workflow_run` trigger already fires for those runs -- it is unfiltered, and
# this script has always narrated "event is 'push', not merge_group" for them -- so
# the change is in the DECISION and nowhere else. Three questions #774 leaves open,
# answered here rather than in a pull request body:
#
#   * **A second trigger?** No trigger was needed. What differs is the RULE, which
#     is a row of `EventPolicy` below.
#   * **Does the release gate change instead?** No. `check-release-gate` already
#     asserts every job in `build.yml` appears in `release.needs`, so a red
#     packaging job cannot ship a release -- it would fail again on the tag. What
#     was missing is not a gate, it is being TOLD, weeks before the tag.
#   * **And `pull_request`?** Out of scope, deliberately and permanently. Such a
#     failure is on the pull request page, which somebody is looking at; a report
#     per red pull-request job is noise, and noise is how a notifier gets ignored.
#     It is a row here saying `none` so the decision is visible rather than absent.
#
# **On master every failure is reportable, where in a queue only the unrequired
# ones are.** In a queue the required contexts eject the pull request and name the
# check, so reporting them again is duplicate noise. A push is gated by nothing at
# all, so that distinction has no meaning there -- and a wholly broken master
# opening several reports once is proportionate, because master is broken.
#
# The comment storm #774 fears is answered at the OTHER end: the workflow passes
# `PACE_REPORT_ONLY_IF_NEW` for a push, so a context that goes on failing on
# every subsequent push updates nothing. A push report is a TRANSITION -- this
# context started failing -- and the second failure is not a new fact.
#
# ## What it must not do
#
# It must not fail the merge group. It runs from a separate workflow on
# `workflow_run`, after the queue has already concluded, so it has no way to --
# and it opens an issue rather than returning a status anybody waits on. The same
# is true of a push: nothing waits on this.
#
# ## Skipped, absent, unstarted and failed are four states
#
# A notifier that says "no failures" because the run never started is #684 one
# level further out, and this repository has now made that mistake in four
# separate instruments. So every conclusion is looked up in a TABLE and an
# unenumerated one is a hard failure rather than whichever bucket a negation
# happens to catch -- `gh` renders a RUNNING job's conclusion as the empty
# string, not `null`, and a `!= null` test once classified every in-progress job
# here as FAILED (`.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md`). And "nothing to report"
# is asserted POSITIVELY: a record in which nothing failed and nothing SUCCEEDED
# is not a clean run, it is a run that did not happen, so it is refused.

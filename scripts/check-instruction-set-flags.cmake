# No first-party translation unit is compiled with a GLOBAL instruction-set flag (#1442).
#
# `-msha`, `-msse4.1`, `-march=native` or `/arch:AVX2` on a target lets the compiler use those
# instructions anywhere in each unit it reaches -- including in the out-of-line copies of inline
# functions the linker then hands to code that runs on every CPU. A hardware path asks for its
# instructions per function and runs only once the CPU has been asked (#1420 carries the rule and
# the one such path).
#
# **No CI run can catch a violation**: the runners HAVE the instructions, so a target that gains
# `-msha` builds and passes everywhere it is tested and dies of SIGILL on the customer CPU that lacks
# them. So the question is asked of the flags, not of a run.
#
# ## Why the compile database
#
# It is the artefact every flag reaches after CMake has merged them -- a preset, a `-D` on a configure
# line, `CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` and its `_INIT`, a toolchain file, target and per-source options,
# generator expressions. A scan of CMake files would see only the spellings somebody thought to look
# for. It is asked of the database of the build that SHIPS as well as of the ones that test:
# `scripts/check-instruction-set-flags.sh` says why, and runs it from the package jobs.
#
# ## First-party is an inclusion list: `src/`
#
# Not "the source tree minus dependencies": CI points `CPM_SOURCE_CACHE` inside the workspace, so every
# dependency's units sit under the source tree, and an exclusion rule bets on a layout this repository
# does not control. Units outside `src/` -- dependencies, `vendor/monocypher`, sources generated into the
# build tree -- are declined, counted and the first one named. A flag on a first-party TARGET reaches
# that target's `src/` units too, so declining its generated units loses nothing this rule is about.
#
# ## An unknown `-m` flag is refused
#
# `-m` reaches instruction sets (`-msha`, `-mavx2`) and much besides, and an allowlist that did not name
# a flag would read identically to one that had judged it. So a flag that enables nothing gets a row
# with its reason, and a row exists only for a spelling something produces -- the first real new one
# arrives as a refusal. `-arch` names an Apple slice, and the two BASELINE slices are rows of their own:
# CMake passes `-arch arm64` on every Apple build -- the macOS leg's database carries it on all 709
# first-party units, and this tree sets no `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES`, so the flag comes from CMake's own
# Apple handling rather than from anything here. `arm64` and `x86_64` imply no instruction set beyond
# their architecture's own; every other value is refused, `x86_64h` because it implies AVX2 and an
# unknown slice because a slice is exactly the thing that can imply instructions. The spelling ALONE is
# refused too, since the value can arrive in a token of its own.
# A target triple (`--target=`, `-target`, `-Xclang -triple`)
# is refused for the same reason, and nothing here sets `CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_TARGET`; so is clang's
# `-Xclang -target-cpu`, which is `-march=` one layer down. Every other spelling of a refused flag is read as
# the flag it spells: clang's `-Xclang=<flag>`, clang-cl's `-clang:` beside `/clang:`, GCC's `--machine-<ext>`.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, stated so nobody reads it as more
#
#   - Per-function attributes (`__attribute__((target(...)))`, `[[gnu::target]]`): the legitimate spelling.
#   - Target pragmas: `scripts/check-target-pragmas.cmake`, which asks the tree rather than a build.
#   - Units outside `src/`, including vendored and dependency code.
#   - Flags that never reach a compile command: a compiler's BUILD-TIME environment (cl's `CL` and `_CL_`,
#     clang's `CCC_OVERRIDE_OPTIONS`), driver configuration files clang reads beside its binary, defaults a
#     compiler was built with (a GCC configured `--with-arch=`), and the link line, where LTO code
#     generation may take its own `-march`. Those are asked of the COMPILER instead:
#     `src/tests/InstructionSetBaseline.cpp`, which every executable compiles (#1447).
#   - A generator that writes no compile database (Visual Studio).
#   - A flag inside a quoted define (`-DX="-msha"`) is REFUSED, not understood, and a response file named
#     inside a response file is refused rather than followed: the reader errs toward refusing.
#
# ## Reading the database in batches
#
# `string(JSON ... GET)` parses the WHOLE document on every call, so reading every entry one GET at a time is
# quadratic in the database's size, which grows with every target: measured before batching, 5.8 s on CMake 4.3.1
# on Windows and 2.8 s on CMake 3.28 on WSL for one walk of a 1.48 MB, ~900-entry database. So the document is parsed
# whole ONCE, to validate it and count its entries, and is then read in batches of about `BatchBytes` of text, each
# cut after an entry and parsed on its own.
#
# The cut rests on a claim about CMake's WRITER, not about JSON: CMake puts each entry's closing brace alone at the
# start of a line, so `\n},` can end an entry and nothing else -- a JSON string cannot hold a raw line break, and a
# CMake entry holds no nested object. The claim is checked before it is used: the document must hold as many
# line-leading `}` as it has entries (one with no line break at all holds none), and every batch must parse on its
# own (a cut inside an entry leaves that entry's braces unbalanced, so it cannot). A database laid out any other way
# is read whole -- exactly as correctly, and quadratically -- and every run says which path it took,
# `parse: batched (N batch(es))` or
# `parse: whole-document (fallback: <reason>)`, so a fast path that stopped engaging is visible rather than slow.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<tree> -DPACE_COMPILE_DATABASE=<compile_commands.json>
#         [-DPACE_PLANT_UNIT=src/<unit>] -P scripts/check-instruction-set-flags.cmake
#
# With PACE_PLANT_UNIT, each of that unit's real commands also gets its grammar's PlantRows flag,
# and the run passes only when every planted flag is refused -- proof, on a real database, that the
# reading still sees a flag on a real first-party unit. The planted flag goes into the command text, so
# the extraction is exercised and not only the rows.
#
# The verdict is `CMake Error` in the output, never the exit code.

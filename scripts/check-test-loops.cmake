# The tests' loops: no C-style `for`, no `while` that polls an atomic, and no coroutine
# `while` that does nothing but park on its reactor until something holds.
#
# ## Why a check and not a sentence
#
# `AGENT.md` has said *C-style loops are forbidden* for as long as the tree has had a
# rulebook, and #1446's census still found them in 76 test files -- 198 sites, under the
# pattern `\bfor \([^;{]*;[^;{]*;` over `*_test.cpp` outside `vendor/`. The pattern travels
# with the number because the census that opened the ticket used a narrower one,
# `\bfor \([^:)]*;[^;]*;`, which cannot see a loop whose init names a qualified type
# (`for (std::size_t i = 0; ...)`) and counted 131. A rule stated in the files that obey it
# reaches no file that does not.
#
# The second rule is the ticket's subject. A test that waits for another thread by polling
# an atomic in a `while` either counts iterations, which a loaded host loses, or does not
# bound the wait at all, which turns the failure it exists to catch into a suite timeout
# naming nothing -- or, under a `REQUIRE` that already fired, a join that never returns.
# The census found both shapes (`Clock_test`'s worker start gate and `DashboardSampler_test`'s
# blocking read spun unbounded). The tree's one test wait is `src/tests/BoundedWait.hpp`:
# `WaitUntil` on the case's thread, `OffThreadWaits` on a helper thread.
#
# The third is the same wait run by a COROUTINE, which cannot block its own reactor thread in
# `WaitUntil` and so parked a turn or a millisecond at a time with no bound at all: four tests
# did (#1453), two of them on a plain `bool` the atomic rule cannot see. Their wait is
# `AwaitUntil`, bounded on the reactor's own clock.
#
# ## What it matches
#
# Over the file with its comments removed and its newlines kept
# (`fastcached_strip_comments`), so prose explaining a rule is not read as breaking it and a
# header broken across lines is still one header:
#
#   * a `for (` whose header reaches TWO `;` before the `)` that closes it -- a range-for
#     reaches its `)` first, and a range-for with an init-statement
#     (`for (std::size_t i = 0; auto& byte: bytes)`) holds only one. A brace group -- a
#     lambda body -- is read as one element, so the `;` inside it are not the header's: a
#     counting loop whose init or condition holds a lambda is still refused, and a range-for
#     whose init-statement or range holds one is still quiet;
#   * a `while (` whose condition calls `.load(` or `->load(`;
#   * a `while (` whose body STARTS with `co_await` of `SleepFor`, `SleepUntil` or `ResumeOn`,
#     or of core-cpp's spellings of the same parks since #1596 -- `core::net::sleepUntil` and a
#     loop's `delay` member, reached through `::`, `->` or `.` -- braced or not, whatever its
#     condition reads. A site both rules match is one site, reported by this rule.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, said here so nobody over-applies it
#
#   * A `while` that is not polling an atomic -- stepping through `find()` or `getline()`, or
#     reading until a peer is done -- is ordinary and stays. So is a coroutine `while` that
#     WORKS before it parks, as a heartbeat beats and then sleeps, and a `for` that parks a
#     fixed number of turns: neither is waiting for something to hold.
#   * `vendor/` is not scanned: it is another project's code, changed upstream.
#   * `spin` and `poll` do not reach non-test sources; only `loop` does (#1452), per the scope
#     table below.
#   * A token inside a STRING LITERAL reads as code, as in every regex-shaped reader here.
#
# ## Its residual, in both directions, so the next surprise is diagnosed rather than exempted
#
#   * FAILS OPEN on a header nested deeper than it reads: a lambda whose body holds its own
#     braces, or parentheses three deep. Such a header matches nothing, so a C-style loop
#     spelled that way passes. Deepen `headerElement` rather than exempting the site.
#   * FAILS CLOSED on a `;` inside a string or character literal in a range-for's header
#     (`for (auto const sep = ";"; auto const& item: items)`), because literals read as code:
#     that header holds two `;` as this reader counts them. C++ has no other way to put a
#     second `;` in a range-for's header outside a brace or parenthesis group.
#   * The coroutine rule FAILS OPEN on a wait spelled any other way: a park that is not the
#     body's first statement (`while (!done) { ++turns; co_await ResumeOn { *loop }; }`), a
#     park through a coroutine of another name, a `do ... while`, a coroutine that awaits
#     ITSELF until the condition holds, and a condition nested three parentheses deep or
#     holding a lambda. It reads the one shape #1453's census found, all four times; a wait
#     spelled another way is left to review rather than guessed at by a wider pattern.
#
# ## Exemptions
#
# An exemption's `text` is matched as a SUBSTRING of the loop header **as this check extracts
# it**, and that header STOPS AT THE SECOND `;` -- `loopPattern` is anchored to end there. So for
#
#     for (; it != end; it.increment(ec))
#
# the string being searched is `for (; it != end;` and the INCREMENT CLAUSE IS NOT IN IT. Naming
# `it.increment(ec)` -- by far the most identifying fragment, and the obvious thing to write --
# makes the row match nothing, and the row is then refused as stale with a message saying the
# site was converted or deleted. It was not; it is exactly where it was. Name something from the
# init or the condition instead.
#
# A text may also not contain `;`, for a different reason and with a different symptom: a
# semicolon is what CMake splits a list on, so it breaks the row into pieces when this table is
# DEFINED, and the arity check below reports a field count rather than a character.
#
# Both constraints have the same cause -- the header's two semicolons -- and a `loop` exemption is
# the one kind of row where that is the natural thing to write.
#
# A row states its REASON, so an allowed site cannot be spelled the way a forgotten one
# is, and a row that has stopped matching anything is refused as STALE: an exemption
# nobody has to keep true outlives its argument and waves the next site through.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports
# failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-test-loops.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

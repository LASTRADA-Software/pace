# End-to-end test of the macOS .pkg (POSIX). Installs the real package onto the
# running machine, exercises it, and removes it again.
#
# This needs root and it modifies the host, so it is deliberately not part of
# `ctest`. CI runs it; a developer can too, on a machine they do not mind
# installing pace-kv on.
#
# The properties it asserts, each of which has failed silently at some point in
# a way the unit tests could not see:
#
#   1. Redistributable    — the shipped binaries link nothing outside /usr/lib.
#                           A Homebrew dylib path here means the package works
#                           only on the build machine.
#   2. Correct payload    — the binaries, the PATH entry and the uninstaller are
#                           installed, and the *live* config is NOT payload (or
#                           the seed-if-absent postinstall is dead code and an
#                           upgrade eats the operator's edits).
#   3. Panes are legible  — each HTML pane starts with a doctype and declares
#                           utf-8. Installer.app sniffs the first bytes to decide
#                           HTML from plain text, so a leading comment makes the
#                           pane render with every tag visible — which is how the
#                           welcome and read-me panes shipped once, while the
#                           .txt license looked fine and disguised it.
#   4. Service runs       — the selected launchd job is registered and serving.
#   4b. Worker installs   — the compile worker's account exists whichever launchd
#                           choice was made, and a system-scope worker
#                           registration is accepted, names that unprivileged
#                           account, and carries only flags the worker's own
#                           parser accepts. Refused outright before #87.
#   5. Config survives    — an edit made after install is still there after a
#                           reinstall of the same package.
#   6. Uninstall is total — no files, no job, no PATH entry, no receipts, and
#                           neither account. Including the worker job from 4b,
#                           which the package never installed but whose binary it
#                           is about to delete.
#
# --scope selects which launchd choice the installer is driven with:
#
#   daemon  installs the system-wide LaunchDaemon. This is the variant CI runs,
#           because it is the only one that can be verified end-to-end without a
#           human: a LaunchDaemon needs no logged-in user, so the account
#           creation, the registration and the serving are all observable on a
#           headless runner.
#   agent   installs the per-user LaunchAgent (the installer's default). Its
#           postinstall deliberately does nothing when there is no console user
#           with a GUI session, which is exactly the situation on a CI runner —
#           so this variant can only assert the payload there. The agent's
#           launchd behaviour is covered instead by macos-service-e2e.sh, which
#           drives the same code path directly.
#
# Usage:
#   macos-package-e2e.sh --pkg <path-to-.pkg> [--port <n>] [--scope agent|daemon]
#
# Exit codes: 0 = all assertions held; 1 = a failure; 77 = a runtime
# prerequisite was missing (skip).

# The daemon's OWN reason for exiting, which this fixture used to throw away.
#
# `launchctl print` says `last exit code = 2` and `launchctl list` says the same 2,
# and neither says WHICH refusal fired: `ExitUsage` is ONE name for every refusal
# this program has -- a flag missing, an endpoint that will not bind, a toolchain
# survey that found nothing (#1060) -- so the exit code cannot discriminate and was
# never meant to. The sentence naming which one goes to the job's stderr, which
# `BuildLaunchdPlist` points at `<logdir>/<label>.err.log`, and nothing here read it.
#
# Measured: `Package (macOS .pkg)` failed 2 of 30 completed runs across the last 40
# `build.yml` runs -- `adaaf35c` and `bbc53c2f`, about 100 minutes apart, on branches
# touching neither `packaging/` nor `Platform/` nor the node -- with an identical
# `runs = 3` / `last exit code = 2` signature and the reason sitting on the runner's
# disk, discarded (#1055).

# the postinstall and the uninstaller are generated from.

# Two copies of this list used to be spelled out below, and a fourth installed
# binary reached the variable and neither copy -- so its symlink was asserted
# neither present after an install nor GONE after an uninstall. The second is the
# quiet direction: a leftover symlink points at a deleted executable and nothing
# else in the tree would report it.
#
# `sed` on the source tree rather than a build-tree query, because this fixture is
# handed a `.pkg` and knows nothing about a build directory. It REFUSES when it
# reads nothing: an empty list makes both loops below pass vacuously, which is the

# --- 4b. a system-scope worker registration must be possible ---------------

# assertion that the account is actually usable for what it exists for.
#
# Run in both scopes, because the account comes from the Runtime component: an
# operator who took the installer's default (the per-user agent for pace-kv)
# must still be able to install a system-wide worker.
#
# Before #87 this refused with "the 'pace-node' service account does not
# exist", which is the correct behaviour given no account -- a system launchd job
# naming no UserName runs as ROOT, and this process compiles input that arrived
# over the network. So the assertion is on the refusal being GONE, and on the
# registration naming the unprivileged account rather than defaulting to root.

# naming the account, and swallowing it would turn a diagnosis into "exit 1".
# `--listen-node` NAMED, never left to its default (#1099). The default 0xFC
# port is 6674, which is the port the daemon installed above is already serving
# on -- so the registration succeeded, the job was kicked, and the worker died at
# every start with
#
#     [ERROR] --listen-node: cannot bind 127.0.0.1:6674 (bind(...) failed: 48)
#
# `48` is EADDRINUSE on Darwin. What the fixture reported instead was a
# `launchctl kickstart` timeout which says, in its own text, that it cannot tell
# a busy host from a stall -- an honest verdict about the wrong question, with
# the evidence naming the real cause printed twelve lines above it. The node's
# own error even names the remedy: "give --listen-node a port of its own".
#
# DERIVED from `$port` rather than written out, so `--port` still moves every
# surface this fixture opens together; a literal would collide again the day two
# of these run with different `--port` values. `--advertise` MOVES WITH IT, and
# that is not cosmetic. Naming
# `--listen-node` explicitly turns on a startup rule that an unset one does not
# have: the node then refuses an `--advertise` naming a different port, because a
# client told to dial a port nothing listens on gets no compile while the
# registration succeeds and every counter reads normally. Measured against the
# binary rather than reasoned about -- `--print-surfaces` accepts the pair below
# and refuses `--listen-node=...:6677` beside `--advertise=...:6676` by name:
#
#     --advertise=127.0.0.1:6676 names this machine at port 6676, and this node
#     serves compiles on 127.0.0.1:6677. ... Name the port --listen-node serves
#
# So fixing the bind collision alone would have traded one startup refusal for
# another, and the fixture would have failed just as hard one line further on.
# The unset default escapes that rule (an activated socket may be forwarded, so
# `--advertise` is authoritative there) which is why the ORIGINAL command was
# accepted with a 6674 bind and a 6676 advertisement.
#
# No `--scheduler`: a node that serves is refused one, and registers its worker
# with the fleet its formation record names -- its own, on a first start, which is
# why consensus is on, on a port derived like the others, with no discovery beacon
# on the port every node on the segment shares.
#
# `--cluster-dir` since #178 PR 6: the node keeps its identity key and its formation
# record there. A directory of its own under the prefix, because the registration
# hands the directory it names to the worker's account, so it must be one nothing

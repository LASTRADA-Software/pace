# Every `cmake -P` check registered in src/tests/CMakeLists.txt must be one ctest
# can HEAR, and one whose meaning does not depend on which CMake ran it.
#
# Three rules over one subject: it must carry a failure signal, because a script
# cannot report one with an exit code; the script behind it must declare a CMake
# minimum, because script mode sets no policies; and everything that READS that
# signal must read ALL of it. Pass 3 states the second in full and pass 5 the
# third.
#
# This file used to justify itself by saying that `message(FATAL_ERROR)` in
# script mode prints `CMake Error ...` and exits **0** on CMake 3.28, this
# project's declared minimum -- "measured: 3.28.3 exits 0, 4.3.1 exits 1".
#
# **That does not reproduce, and the sentence was the sole stated reason for
# thirteen registrations** (#565). Measured across six CMake versions -- 3.22.6,
# 3.25.2, 3.27.9, 3.28.3, 3.31.6, 4.3.0 -- and six script shapes -- bare, inside
# `if()`, inside `function()`, inside `foreach()`, inside `macro()`, and
# `SEND_ERROR` -- the exit code is **1** every time, with controls proving the
# harness could read a zero. `ctest -R fatal-error-exit` now asks the same
# question on every platform CI builds rather than leaving it a sentence.
#
# The likely mechanism, because it is worth recording how a measured claim came
# out wrong: a TRUE neighbouring fact carried one clause too far. A `-P` script
# genuinely cannot CHOOSE its exit code before CMake 3.29 -- `cmake_language(EXIT)`
# is 3.29, and on 3.28.3 it is an unknown command -- which is why the SKIP
# direction correctly uses `SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION` rather than
# `SKIP_RETURN_CODE 77`. "Cannot choose its exit code" was then read as "cannot
# signal failure by exit code", and `message(FATAL_ERROR)` gives you exactly one
# code you did not choose, 1, which is the only one a failure needs. The two
# reproducible ways to see a 0 are both instrument shapes and neither is a CMake
# version: an unguarded pipeline (`cmake -P … | tail` reports the pipe), and a
# nested `cmake -P` whose `RESULT_VARIABLE` is unread.
#
# **The requirement stays, and its reasons are now the true ones.** Two, and
# neither was the stated one:
#
#   * `message(WARNING)` exits **0** on every version above while printing
#     `CMake Warning`, so only an output verdict can hear a check that warns --
#     the pattern covers both words for that reason (#517), and
#     `script-check-warning-canary` is the half that proves it.
#   * a check that shells out to another CMake without reading `RESULT_VARIABLE`
#     exits 0 with its child's `CMake Error` on the output. That is a real shape
#     for a check that drives another script, and it is what
#     `script-check-canary` is now built out of.
#
# The fix's own weakness is that it is a property somebody has to remember.
# `script-check-canary` covers the case where the mechanism stops working; this
# covers the case where a new registration never opts into it -- which is the far
# likelier of the two, and the one that reads as a working check.
#
# And the third question, which is about the canaries rather than the checks:
# `WILL_FAIL` inverts ctest's whole verdict, and that verdict is `non-zero exit OR
# the pattern matched`, so a canary exiting non-zero passes on its status alone and
# proves nothing about the property. Pass 4 runs every WILL_FAIL registration's
# script and refuses a non-zero one -- the alternative being one more sentence
# somebody has to remember, which is what #565 was about.
#
# The set of checks is READ from src/tests/CMakeLists.txt, never restated here.
# A second copy of the list is not a cross-check; it is a second thing to be
# wrong, and it would go stale in the direction that reports green.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P` for the reason check-test-names.cmake gives: it reads a
# file, compares strings and reports, so a .sh + .ps1 pair would be two
# implementations of one rule differing only in syntax. It is therefore subject
# to its own rule, and is registered with the property like everything else.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-script-check-signals.cmake
#
# Exit codes: whatever CMake gives it, which for `message(FATAL_ERROR)` is 1 on
# every version measured. The verdict is still read from the presence of
# `CMake Error` in the output, because that is the rule this file enforces and a
# check exempting itself from its own rule is not one.

# The `"value|reason"` row convention, defined once (#513). Rows here are

# name and the path travel as ONE row because they are one registration -- two lists
# appended in step are two lists that can stop being in step, and nothing would say
# so.
#
# This file used to carry a splitter of its own, on the stated ground that neither
# field can hold a `|` and that the count should be asserted rather than assumed.
# The shared one asserts the count too, and it does not go through
# `string(REPLACE "|" ";")` and `list(GET)` -- which is what made the private one

# a line containing a semicolon becomes two elements, the line numbers drift and
# every verdict after it is drawn from the wrong place. Escaping first is what
# keeps one line one element.
#
# A semicolon is only HALF the hazard. CMake's list grouping also treats `[` and
# `]` as structure, so one unbalanced bracket -- in a COMMENT, where nobody is
# thinking about CMake syntax -- merges every following line into one element.
#
# This check is the sharp case for that, because going blind does NOT make it
# fail. It counts registrations and asserts each one can report failure, so a
# splitter that stops seeing most of the file leaves a smaller set that still
# passes unanimously. Measured while fixing #502: a bracket in a comment took it
# from 21 registrations to 3, and it reported success both times. An emptiness
# guard cannot catch that -- 3 is not 0 -- so the fix has to be here, in the
# splitter, rather than in a check on the count.
#
# Two precisions #495 measured, which this comment originally lacked. Only an
# UNBALANCED bracket groups; `[[nodiscard]]` is completely harmless, so treating
# every `[` and `]` as structure is broader than the truth. And replacing them is
# safe here by WHAT THIS CHECK MATCHES -- `add_test(NAME ...)` and property names,
# none containing a bracket -- rather than by construction. A pattern that did
# contain one would break silently. `check-worker-refusals-counted` is the worked
# example: the same fix took it from three refusal spellings to zero, and it now
# walks its lines without ever building a CMake list.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pass 5: everything that READS the signal must read ALL of it (#672).
#
# The signal is two words. `PACE_SCRIPT_CHECK_FAILED` is
# `CMake Error|CMake Warning` and both halves are canaried -- `script-check-canary`
# for the first, `script-check-warning-canary` for the second -- because
# `message(WARNING)` exits 0 on every CMake while changing meaning, and an unset
# policy, a deprecated command or a dev warning all arrive that way.
#
# A selftest harness runs the check it is about as a SUB-PROCESS and reads the
# verdict out of the captured output itself. ctest never sees that output, so the
# registration's pattern does not reach it and the harness has to spell the rule
# again. Twenty of them spelled half of it -- `CMake Error` alone -- so a sub-run
# that merely WARNED was scored a clean pass by the very fixtures whose job is to
# prove a guard bites. Measured on the tree that fixed it, by giving every check an
# unconditional `message(WARNING)`: 2 of 22 harnesses objected before, 22 of 22
# after. A harness laxer than the registration it stands for is a fake more
# permissive than the thing it models.
#
# So this pass is the reason nobody has to remember, which is the argument pass 2
# makes for the registrations one level up.
#
# ## What it recognises, and what it deliberately does not
#
# A line that tests text for the literal `CMake Error` -- `string(FIND)`,
# `string(REGEX)` or `MATCHES` -- must spell `CMake Warning` on the same line. That
# is narrow on purpose: it is exact about the shape it reads and the remedy is one
# word.
#
# It cannot see a harness that reads NO verdict at all. Two here did not: one
# asserted only substrings, and one defaulted its `must appear` needle to the error
# word. Both were given an explicit warning assertion rather than this scan being
# widened, because "runs a sub-`cmake -P` and draws a conclusion from it" has no
# reliable static shape and a guard that guessed at it would refuse correct files.
# Said plainly, so a green pass here is not read as coverage of that.
#
# ## Deliberate must not be spelled like forgotten
#
# Some sites read the words `CMake Error` for a reason that is not a verdict: a case
# TABLE spells it in a `must not appear` field to mean "this row expects
# acceptance", and `check-fatal-error-exit` asks whether one specific
# `message(FATAL_ERROR)` arm produced one, where a warning would be the wrong answer
# rather than a stricter one. Those carry `verdict-error-only:` and a REASON in the
# comment block immediately above, and the count is PRINTED on every run -- a marker
# with no reason is refused, and a marker nobody ever reads would spell "forgot" in
# the vocabulary of "decided".
#
# ## Why the walk builds no list
#
# The same reason pass 1 escapes before splitting, one step further: this is a
# FIND/SUBSTRING walk that never hands a line to CMake's list parser, so an
# unbalanced `[` in a comment cannot merge two lines and move a reported line
# number. The whole-file test comes first, because most files under scripts/ hold
# neither word and reading those line by line is the cost this repository has
# already paid once.

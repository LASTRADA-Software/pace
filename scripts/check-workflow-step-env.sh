# Every name a workflow `run:` step's script READS from the environment is one that step can see (#1448, #1175).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-workflow-step-env.sh [--plant] [--workflows <dir>]
#   bash scripts/check-workflow-step-env.sh --self-test
#
# ## Why
#
# A step's environment is its own: a name declared in the `env:` of the step next door is not in scope, and
# `${{ ... }}` is substituted before the shell ever sees the script, so nothing about the file's appearance says
# which names will exist. #1174 is what that cost -- `merge-group-report.yml` defined `EVENT` on its decide step and
# read it in the reporting step, which died on its first line under `set -u`, so the notifier opened no report in
# its entire life. Without `set -u` the name expands to EMPTY and a branch is silently taken the wrong way, which is
# worse, so this covers every `run:`, not only the ones turning on `-u`.
#
# The rule was first enforced over that one workflow, inside `check-merge-group-report.sh`, and so reached 3 of the
# tree's 135 `run:` steps at fa8fb0c3: exact about the file it knew and silent about the rest, which reads identically
# to complete coverage. So the files are a GLOB, every file it finds must be read, and the count of each is printed.
#
# ## What a step can see
#
#   * the workflow's `env:`, its job's `env:` (only its own job's), and its own `env:`;
#   * names its own script assigns (bash: `NAME=`, `NAME+=` in command position, a declarator such as `export` or
#     `local`, `read`, `for NAME in`, `mapfile`/`readarray`, `getopts`; PowerShell: `$env:NAME =`);
#   * the runner's and the shell's own vocabulary, which is an ALLOWLIST and fails CLOSED -- a name nobody has listed
#     is refused and gets added deliberately, where an open pattern would have admitted `EVENT`.
#
# A name an EARLIER step or an action exported through `$GITHUB_ENV` does reach a later step at run time, and is
# still refused unless the step names it in its own `env:` -- `NAME: ${{ env.NAME }}`, the spelling the tree already
# uses for `CLANG_TIDY_BIN`. That row is the only spelling that says, in the step, where the name comes from.
#
# ## The `${{ env.NAME }}` expressions themselves (#1460)
#
# That convention concentrates the risk in one spelling, so the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is read too. An expression naming
# nothing in scope is substituted with an EMPTY STRING, with no error and no warning, so `SCCACHE_PAHT:
# ${{ env.SCCACHE_PAHT }}` defines the name the shell half then finds and nothing anywhere objects -- #1174 through a
# second door.
#
# Read in a step's `run:`, `with:`, `if:`, `name:` and `env:` values. Satisfied by the workflow's or the job's
# `env:`, by a `$GITHUB_ENV` write in an EARLIER step of the same job, by an `ActionExports` row, and -- for every
# field except a step's own `env:` values -- by the step's own `env:`. That exception is the whole point rather than
# a detail: GitHub substitutes an `env:` value before the step's environment exists, so a typo that reads the name
# it is defining would otherwise satisfy itself.
#
# `ActionExports` holds only names some step READS, and a row is refused STALE in both directions -- its action used
# by nobody, or its name read by nobody. A `$GITHUB_ENV` write is any line NAMING `GITHUB_ENV`: every `NAME=` token
# on it is taken as written, which covers the bash `echo`/`printf` redirect, PowerShell's `>> $env:GITHUB_ENV` and
# `Add-Content`, each with a case. Job-level and workflow-level fields -- `runs-on`, a job's `env:` values, a job's
# `if:` -- are out of scope and unread, as is every context other than `env.`.
#
# ## Which shell reads the script
#
# The step's `shell:`, else its job's `defaults.run.shell`, else the workflow's, else the runner's default (pwsh on
# Windows, bash on Ubuntu, macOS or Linux) -- for `runs-on` as written, or, where it names the job's matrix, for EVERY
# combination of that matrix, which the shared walk computes (#1432). Combinations whose runners' defaults differ are
# REFUSED (`varying-shell`): one script cannot be held to two models. A step whose shell cannot be resolved, or names
# a shell `ShellModels` has no row for, is REFUSED rather than read by the wrong model:
#
#   * bash reads `$NAME` and `${NAME...}`, outside single quotes, quoted heredocs, and `\$`.
#   * PowerShell reads the environment only as `$env:NAME` or `${env:NAME}`, case-insensitively, outside single
#     quotes and single-quoted here-strings; a plain `$name` is a PowerShell variable and is not the environment.
#
# The models are deliberately NARROW -- a model more permissive than the shell waves through the one read that
# matters. The reader of the YAML is narrow the same way: a line it cannot place by indentation (a flow mapping, an
# alias, a quoted key, a second document) is REFUSED, never skipped.
#
# ## What says the reader read every step
#
# Nothing in the reader, which is why the count is not in it: every `run:` key outside a scalar is counted by a second
# walk that knows only which lines a scalar owns, both numbers are printed per file, and a key the reader did not place
# as a step's script (or a `defaults.run`) is refused by line. A step whose keys sit where the reader does not look
# would otherwise read as a step that reads nothing. The plant (`--plant`) answers the other half on the real files:
# every step the reader DID place is read by a model that sees a read at its end.
#
# A tracked composite action (`action.yml`/`action.yaml` whose `runs.using` is `composite`) has `run:` steps under the
# same rule and none of them is read here, so the unplanted run refuses one by name; git's listing is the file set.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, so that nobody reads a pass as more than it is
#
# A name reached by `eval` or indirect expansion; one a sourced file defines; `${#arr[@]}`. And four stated blind
# spots in the expression half, each narrow and each the reason a wider reader was not written:
#
#   * a `$GITHUB_ENV` write whose names are on LATER lines (`cat >> "$GITHUB_ENV" <<EOF`) is not seen; the two
#     writes in this tree are both the `echo` form;
#   * a step `env:` VALUE written as a BLOCK SCALAR is read, but the `--plant` for expressions does not reach it;
#   * an expression inside a YAML comment is correctly unread, and one inside a `#` line of a `run:` BODY is read,
#     because GitHub substitutes that one before the shell ever sees it;
#   * a name a `${{ }}` expression supplies to the SHELL is still invisible to the shell half, which is the original
#     residual and is unchanged: the expression is substituted before the script exists.
#
# ## Where in a script a name has to be defined
#
# A definition is a LINE (#1461). A read is judged against the scopes, the allowlist, and what the script defines at
# or ABOVE the read's own line -- not against the whole script, which is what bash would have to be for the looser
# model to be right. Relaxed to the whole script inside a LOOP body, which runs again, and a FUNCTION body, which
# runs wherever it is called. A `trap` handler needs no relaxation and getting to that answer was the work: see the
# section on it beside `define()`. The grain is a line, so a read and an assignment on ONE line are not ordered
# against each other, and for PowerShell the relaxation is every brace-enclosed block. Both limits are stated there.
#
# bash 3.2 and a POSIX awk: this runs on macOS's `/bin/bash` and BSD awk.
#
# ## What the self-test costs, and why its TIMEOUT did not move (#1550)
#
# Its cost is PROCESS CREATIONS, which Windows charges for heavily and an x64-emulated
# `windows-11-arm` more heavily still: `workflow-step-env-selftest` took 77.97 s of its `TIMEOUT 120`
# on `Windows-cl-release-arm64` and 24-35 s on the x64 Windows legs (run 35340951724). These figures
# are pinned to the conditions they were taken under, not live values. Counted with strace over the
# process tree at a0a4d09d, bash 5.3 on Linux: 932 forks and 533 execs. A `mkdir` and a `cat` per
# case staged each workflow, and `Flatten` ran a `printf | tr` pipeline in a subshell on every scan.
# All three are now the shell's own work: 414 forks and 209 execs (bash 3.2.57: 1021 and 533 became
# 503 and 209). Git Bash on a Windows 11 x64 host went from 12.5-14.8 s to 6.7-7.3 s. What remains
# is what the cases exist to drive -- one `awk` per scan and the `git` a composite case stages
# through -- plus a subshell per case, kept because it is what stops one case's state reaching the
# next. `TIMEOUT 120` stays: a timeout is not a verdict about the tree (#1515).

Remedies="undefined-expression|A \`\${{ env.NAME }}\` expression naming nothing in scope is replaced by an EMPTY string, with no error and no warning -- #1174 through a second door (#1460). Add the row to the workflow's or the job's \`env:\`, or write it to \`\$GITHUB_ENV\` from an EARLIER step of the same job, or give \`ActionExports\` a row for the action that exports it. A step's own \`env:\` satisfies that step's \`run:\`, \`with:\`, \`if:\` and \`name:\` -- but NOT another row of the same \`env:\` block, and not its own row: GitHub substitutes those values before the step's environment exists, so a typo'd \`NAME: \${{ env.NAME }}\` would otherwise satisfy itself, which is exactly the shape the convention concentrates.
stale-action-export|An \`ActionExports\` row describes nothing in this tree. Either no step \`uses:\` that action any more, or no \`\${{ env.NAME }}\` expression reads that name any more. A row kept past its subject is the \"forgot\" state wearing the vocabulary of a decision: it goes on satisfying reads that no longer exist and would satisfy a new one by accident. Delete the row, or restore whichever half went away.
undefined|A step's environment is its own: a sibling step's or another job's \`env:\` does not lend it one, so under \`set -u\` the step dies on that line and without it the name expands to EMPTY and a branch is silently taken the wrong way (#1174). Add the row to THIS step's \`env:\` (or its job's), or assign it in the script. A name an earlier step or an action exported is named the same way, as \`NAME: \${{ env.NAME }}\`.
unknown-shell|This check reads a script by the model of the shell that runs it, and has none for this one. Add a row to ShellModels only with a model of how that shell reads its environment, and cases for it.
unresolved-shell|The shell could not be derived: no \`shell:\` on the step, no \`defaults.run.shell\` above it, and a \`runs-on\` that is not a Windows, Ubuntu, macOS or Linux runner -- literally, or in some combination of the job's matrix once \`\${{ matrix.* }}\` is expanded for it (a key that combination lacks expands EMPTY, as GitHub expands it). Name the shell on the step.
varying-shell|The step names no shell, and its job's matrix puts it on runners whose DEFAULT shells differ, so one script would be read by two shells and there is no one model to hold it to. Name the shell on the step, or in the job's \`defaults.run.shell\`. This check does not evaluate a step's \`if:\`, so a step an \`if:\` confines to some legs still needs its shell named -- a script that must differ per runner is two steps, each with an \`if:\` on the matrix value AND a \`shell:\` of its own.
unreadable-matrix|The job's \`strategy.matrix\` is not one the shared model of a matrix (\`scripts/lib/workflow-walk.awk\`) can read -- an expression in its place, a flow mapping, an include or exclude row that is not a block mapping of plain scalars, a value carrying an expression, a list that does not close on its line, an axis with no values, an exclude naming no axis, two keys that differ only in case, a plain value YAML types as anything but a string, an integer or \`true\`/\`false\` (\`3.10\` is the number 3.1; quote it) -- so which runner, name and cache key each leg has cannot be told, and nothing that depends on them is judged. Write it as block mappings of plain-scalar lists and rows; if the construct is needed, teach the walk to read it, with a case.
unreadable-run|The \`run:\` value is not a string this check can read: an alias, a tag, a flow collection, or a quoted scalar that does not close on its own line, has text after its closing quote, or holds a YAML escape other than \`\\\\\"\`, \`\\\\\\\\\` or \`\\\\/\`. YAML quoting is not shell quoting, and a quote read as the shell would read it hides the reads inside it. Write the script as a block scalar (\`run: |\`), or as a plain or quoted string on one line.
unreadable-env|The \`env:\` is not a block mapping this check can read. Write one \`NAME: value\` row per line.
unreadable-yaml|This check places every line of a workflow by its indentation, and cannot place this one -- a flow mapping, an alias, a quoted key, or a second document -- so no step around it can be judged. Write it as a block mapping; if the construct is needed, teach the reader and add a case.
unplaced-run|Every \`run:\` key outside a scalar is counted without the reader and must be a script the reader placed in a step (or a \`defaults.run\`), so a step whose keys the reader stopped recognising is refused here rather than read as clean. If this is a step's script, the reader misplaced the step: teach it, with a case. If it is not one -- an action input or an \`env:\` row named \`run\` -- the reader has no place for it either: teach it where the key sits, with a case. Never rename a script key to get past this.
order|A step's script is read in ORDER, because bash is: the name is expanded where the line stands, so a read above the line that assigns it dies there under \`set -u\` and expands EMPTY without it, taking a branch the wrong way (#1174, #1461). Move the assignment above the read, or give the step's \`env:\` a row for it. A read inside a LOOP body or a FUNCTION body is judged against the whole script instead -- a loop body runs again and a function body runs where it is called -- so this is a read at the script's top level.
unreadable-construct|This check follows a step's loops and functions to know where ordering applies, and lost the one it was inside: the \`do\`/\`done\` pairs, or a function's braces, do not balance in the CODE the lexer left. A \`do\`, a \`done\` or a brace inside a string or a heredoc is masked and cannot cause this. Write the construct so it balances, or teach the reader the shape, with a case."

"""Watches `pace-bench` state the build its figures came from (#1439).

A timing is a quantity under conditions, and the condition that decides whether it is a
cost at all is the build. `pace-bench` used to print nothing about that, and a Debug
bench prints a plausible number -- so while reviewing #1420 an MSVC `cl-release` log was
read as "a Debug-build signature", and the only tell was the build directory's name.

`BuildBannerListener.cpp` fixes that with one Catch2 listener. What this check is for is
the part the C++ cases cannot reach: the listener is actually REGISTERED, it reaches the
real stderr, it marks every figure, and the XML document `bench/inproc_bench.py` parses is
still a document.

## Why the streams are asserted SEPARATELY

`bench/inproc_bench.py` parses this binary's STDOUT with ElementTree. Measured on Catch2
3.6.0: under `--reporter xml` the reporter redirects the streams a test case writes, so
`std::cout`/`std::cerr` from inside a case are captured into `<StdOut>`/`<StdErr>` and the
document still parses -- but C stdio and `std::println` are NOT redirected, and a write
from inside a `BENCHMARK` body lands inside an open start tag and breaks the parse. So
"stdout parses" is a weaker property than it looks, and this check asserts NO MIXED
CONTENT: a stray write between elements leaves a document that parses perfectly and
carries text where only elements belong.

It runs the benchmark BODIES, at one sample each, rather than `--skip-benchmarks`, which
runs no body at all -- the hazard is what a body writes.

## One defect, one red

This binary holds the banner's own unit cases too (`[buildbanner]`, run by
`ctest -R bench-build-banner`), and the run below executes them along with everything else.
A failure there is that test's finding: reported here as well it would make one defect two
reds naming neither, so those cases' verdict is left to it and the stream rules are judged
anyway. A failure anywhere ELSE stops this check, because the streams it reads are the
streams those cases write. The exit status is never the verdict either way -- a short run can
exit 0 (#1211) -- so completeness is read from the document parsing at all, which means
reaching its own closing tag.

## The instrument is proved before the subject is read

A clean tree has no mixed content, so on every run this check first hands its detector a
planted document that DOES and requires it to be found, and a clean one and requires it
not to be. A detector that had quietly stopped matching would otherwise report the same
clean line as a correct one. Those two controls are the reason a green run here means
something; if either fails, the check refuses naming ITSELF and says nothing about the
binary.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check-bench-build-banner.py --binary <path to pace-bench>

Exit:
    0   the binary states its build, marks every figure, and its XML is a document
    1   it does not -- every finding is printed
    2   this check could not answer (the instrument's own controls failed)
    77  the binary is not there, so nothing was run: a prerequisite, not a verdict

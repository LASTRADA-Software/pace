# `check-shipping-configure-guard.sh`'s reader: every SHIPPING configure in a workflow, and whether
# the instruction-set check follows it in the same job and before that job's build. Run as:
#
#   awk -v guard=<script path> -v shipping=<flag> \
#       -f scripts/lib/workflow-walk.awk -f scripts/check-shipping-configure-guard.awk <f> <f>
#
# The file is passed TWICE, which is the walk's convention.
#
# ## What a SHIPPING configure is, as a selector rather than a list
#
# A step whose joined `run:` body invokes `cmake` with `-DPACE_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`. That is the
# one property that distinguishes what a customer receives from what `ctest` measures, and it is
# DATA -- `shipping` is passed in -- rather than the three job names that happen to have it today.
# A fourth packaging job is then a row the selector finds, not a row somebody remembered to add.
#
# The body must be JOINED before it is tested, and that is not a nicety: the macOS configure spells
# `-DPACE_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \` on a continuation line of its own, so a line-wise selector finds
# two of the three and reports a clean tree.
#
# ## The four things asked of the guard step, and why each is its own answer
#
#   * it exists in the SAME JOB -- a check in another job says nothing, because the database it
#     reads is that job's working tree;
#   * it comes BEFORE that job's build -- after it, the objects it would have refused are already
#     built, and on a packaging job already signed;
#   * it carries no `if:` -- a condition is how a step reports without gating;
#   * it carries no `continue-on-error:` -- which is how a step gates without failing.
#
# The last two are different mechanisms with one outcome, so they are two records rather than one
# flag. A refusal that names the wrong one sends somebody to delete the wrong line.
#
# ## The records
#
#   SHIPPING \t <job> \t <step index> \t <step name> \t <binary dir>
#   GUARD    \t <job> \t <step index> \t <argument> \t <if:> \t <continue-on-error:>
#   BUILD    \t <job> \t <step index>
#   STEPS    \t <how many steps the walk placed>
#
# `STEPS` is a POSITIVE CONTROL and the only record that is not a finding. Every verdict here is
# about something MISSING, so over a file the walk could not read every one would answer *nothing
# to vouch for*: absence of the negative is not the positive.

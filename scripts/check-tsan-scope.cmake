# ThreadSanitizer scope hygiene: fail if a test in a concurrency-bearing
# location carries no tag the TSan gate selects on.
#
# `scripts/tsan-gate.sh` runs a SUBSET of the suite, chosen by Catch2 tag
# expression, because a whole-tree sanitized run costs more than it finds. That
# makes the tag list a load-bearing scope declaration -- and a scope declared by
# convention is a scope that rots silently.
#
# It had already rotted before the gate was ever merged. The first version of
# that table selected `[async],[consensus],[distributed]`, on the strength of a
# grep that matched only the FIRST tag in each string. Six of ten `Async/` test
# files are tagged `[reactor]`, `[task]`, `[epoll][reactor]` or
# `[reactor][iocp]` and carry no `[async]` at all -- so the reactor and coroutine
# layer, which is the most thread-bearing code in the tree, was excluded from the
# job written to cover it. Nothing could have noticed: the filter matched 511
# cases, they passed, and every signal in the run said clean.
#
# That is the same failure this project keeps a list about -- the tool ran, the
# artefact was fine, and the thing somebody was told is covered was not -- so the
# fix is not a wider grep. It is this check: the tag convention must be
# ENFORCED, so that a new test file in one of these directories either joins the
# sanitized scope or fails the build.
#
# ## The tag list is READ from the gate, never restated here
#
# An earlier draft of this file kept its own copy of the tags and claimed the two
# "are checked against each other". They were not, and the hole was the same
# shape as the bug above: delete `[task]` from the gate's `TARGETS` row and leave
# a copy here alone, and `Async/Task_test.cpp` still matches the copy, still
# reports covered, and six coroutine cases leave the sanitized scope with every
# signal green. A second list is not a cross-check; it is a second thing to be
# wrong. So the expression is parsed out of `scripts/tsan-gate.sh`, which is the
# text that actually reaches Catch2, and a `TARGETS` table this cannot parse is a
# FATAL_ERROR rather than an empty scope.
#
# ## What this does NOT check, stated so nobody reads more into a green run
#
# - **That the tags appear only in these directories.** A handful of files
#   elsewhere carry them and are swept in as a result. Running MORE than the
#   scope is harmless; running less is the defect.
# - **That a case's tag string is the one Catch2 will read.** The unit here is
#   the CASE since #317 -- it used to be the FILE, so one selected tag anywhere in
#   a file covered every case in it, and a 28th case tagged `[fleetchart]` in a
#   file of 27 `[distributed]` ones left the sanitized scope with this check
#   reporting covered. What is read is the LAST string literal of the header, by
#   a parenthesis-depth walk with the literals removed first; what Catch2 reads is
#   the second macro ARGUMENT. Those agree on every shape in this tree and on
#   every shape the self-test drives, and they are not the same statement.
# - **That the scope table is COMPLETE.** It is a stated claim about where the
#   threads are, checked by nobody. #316 is what that costs: the table named three
#   directories, and a census of `std::thread`/`std::jthread`/`std::async` across
#   `PaceTest`'s own sources finds nineteen threaded files, ELEVEN of which
#   were in no scope row and selected by no gate tag. A grep for those spellings
#   is NOT promoted into a check here, deliberately: it is a proxy -- a file that
#   reaches threads through a helper spawns none of its own, and a file naming
#   `std::thread` in a comment spawns none at all -- so a check built on it would
#   refuse correct files and miss incorrect ones, which is worse than a stated
#   table somebody has to argue with. Re-run the census when adding a threaded
#   test; the residue below is what the table currently claims nothing about.
# - **Anything in a directory a FILE row names.** `Cache/`, `Core/`, `Protocol/`
#   and `Server/` are in scope one file at a time, because most of what is in them
#   is single-threaded and a directory row would demand a scope tag on every case
#   there. So a NEW threaded test file next to `ShardedStorage_test.cpp` joins the
#   sanitized scope only when somebody adds its row. That is a real hole and it is
#   narrower than the one it replaces, which was four whole directories.
#
# A tag is matched where Catch2 would see one: directly after the opening `"` of
# the tag string, or after a preceding `]`. Catch2 also accepts space-separated
# tags (`"[slow] [async]"`); nothing in this tree writes them that way, and the
# failure if something does is a loud false refusal naming the file, never a
# silent pass.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`, for the reason check-repository-hygiene.cmake gives at
# length: this reads files, compares strings and reports, so a .sh + .ps1 pair
# would be two implementations of one rule differing only in syntax.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-tsan-scope.cmake
#
# Its own decisions are driven over synthetic trees by
# `scripts/check-tsan-scope-selftest.cmake`, which `include()`s this file for the
# scope table and the parsed tags rather than restating either.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every test case in scope is selectable. 1 = at least one is
# not, or this check could not answer the question -- which it refuses rather
# than reports clean, every time, because those two are the same green.

# The tests that must be reachable by the gate. One row per location, and a row
# is either a DIRECTORY (every `*_test.cpp` under it, recursively) or a single
# FILE. This list is the one thing stated here rather than derived: it is the
# claim "this is where the threads are", and widening it is a deliberate act.
#
# **Why a row may be a file.** Until #316 every row was a directory, and that
# shape is what kept the threaded tests in `Cache/`, `Core/`, `Protocol/` and
# `Server/` out: those directories are mostly single-threaded, so a directory row
# would have demanded a gate tag on every case in them -- and a check that forces
# an unrelated tag onto a case just to satisfy itself is worse than the gap it
# closes. A file row states the narrower claim the tree actually supports.
#
# It is also the exemption mechanism, which is why there is no separate one: a
# genuinely single-threaded FILE inside a scoped directory is taken out by
# replacing that directory row with the file rows that belong -- not by an
# opt-out somebody can spell without saying what they are opting out of.
#
# Each row and what it is here for. `Transport/` is a directory because every file
# in it carries `[net]`, because its tests spawn threads, and because it is where
# `BlockingListener` lives -- the class the tree's one observed race (#260) was in,
# which this gate reached only through the node binary being run whole. The event
# loop and the sockets that were `Async/` and `Net/` are core-cpp's since #1596, and
# the gate instruments them as core-cpp's archives (`tsan-gate.sh`).

# The reason this scope is a Catch2 tag expression at all, wired so that whoever
# retires the reason is told (#312).
#
# `catch_discover_tests` registers cases by NAME. Catch2 gained
# `ADD_TAGS_AS_LABELS`, which exports each case's tags to CTest as labels, in
# **3.8.0** -- so on a tree carrying an older Catch2 there is no `ctest -L`
# selection to express the sanitized scope with, and the scope has to be a tag
# expression in a bash table plus this check to enforce it.
#
# Two halves, and they were established differently, which is worth keeping
# separate because only one of them can be re-derived from this repository:
#
#   * MEASURED here, 2026-09-10, against the Catch2 3.6.0 source CPM fetched for
#     this tree: `extras/Catch.cmake` contains **zero** occurrences of
#     `ADD_TAGS_AS_LABELS`, with `catch_discover_tests` at 11 occurrences in the
#     same file as the positive control -- so the zero is an absence rather than
#     a grep that stopped working.
#   * SOURCED, not measured: that 3.8.0 is the release that added it, from
#     Catch2's own `docs/release-notes.md`. Nothing in this tree can check that,
#     which is why the tripwire below fires on ANY bump past the watermark rather
#     than on `>= 3.8.0`. A threshold resting on the half nobody here can verify
#     would be a second thing to be wrong.
#
# **The watermark is a pinned CONDITION, not a copy of the current version, and
# must NOT be made to track `CMakeLists.txt`.** It records the version this
# workaround was reasoned about. Point it at the CPM block and the day somebody
# bumps Catch2 the comparison becomes `x > x`, which is false forever: the
# tripwire silently stops existing, which is the failure mode of every other
# thing in this file.
#
# **Raised to 3.16.1 with the scope left a tag expression, on purpose.** The bump
# from 3.6.0 was made for Catch2's standardised exit codes (3.7.1: a skip-only run
# exits 4 and any failure 42), which is what makes `SKIP_RETURN_CODE 4` exact, and
# it fired this tripwire as designed. The half that was only SOURCED is now
# MEASURED: the 3.16.1 source CPM fetched carries `ADD_TAGS_AS_LABELS` 5 times in
# `extras/Catch.cmake`, beside `catch_discover_tests`' 11, and the release notes
# place it in 3.8.0. So the move to `ctest -L` is possible now -- and it is a change
# to `scripts/tsan-gate.sh` that has to carry the empty-scope refusal with it, which
# is its own change rather than a rider on a dependency bump. Until somebody makes
# it, the next bump past this version asks again.

# unbalanced `[` or `]` on the line merges elements. Case names in this tree
# contain brackets by the dozen. So the quotes are found by offset, exactly as
# the TARGETS reader above walks newlines.
#
# Out-parameters: `<out>_last` is the LAST literal, quotes included; `<out>_count`
# is how many there were; `<out>_first` is the first, for reporting; `<out>_bare`
# is the line with every literal removed, which is what parentheses are counted
# on -- a `(` inside a case name must not open anything.
#
# Escaped quotes are not modelled. Measured across all 220 `*_test.cpp` files in
# this tree: zero case headers contain one. If one appears, the name splits into
# two literals and the LAST is still the tag string, so the classification
# survives it; only the reported name would be short.

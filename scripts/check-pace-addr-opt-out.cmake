# Whether a set-but-EMPTY `PACE_ADDR` opts out — checked as a pure
# computation, over the one distinction a developer cannot easily stage.
#
# `docs/tools/pace-cc.md` promises that a set but empty `PACE_ADDR`
# means no caching. The launcher honours that when it reads its own environment;
# `cmake/portable/CompileCache.cmake` decides whether the launcher is used AT ALL,
# and decided it from `if("$ENV{PACE_ADDR}" STREQUAL "")` — true for an unset
# name and for an empty one alike, so `export PACE_ADDR=` was folded straight
# back into the default and kept caching
# ([#372](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/372)).
#
# ## Why a pure function rather than a configure
#
# The two inputs that matter differ ONLY in whether the environment defines the
# name — the value is the empty string either way. A test that exported an empty
# variable and configured would be measuring the SHELL as much as the module, and
# on PowerShell it could not express the case at all: `$env:X = ""` keeps the name
# in PowerShell's own provider view while the child process never receives it, so
# the module would correctly see "unset" and the fixture would be asserting the
# wrong thing while looking right. That trap is documented in
# `docs/tools/pace-cc.md` and is the reason this check drives the DECISION
# rather than the acquisition.
#
# So `_fc_resolve_addr` takes presence as a parameter and reads nothing, and the
# rows below state presence explicitly. The module's own single line of
# acquisition — `if(DEFINED ENV{PACE_ADDR})` — is what this cannot cover, and
# that is stated rather than implied.
#
# Verdict is read from the OUTPUT, not the exit code, because that is the contract
# every `cmake -P` check here is registered under. See src/tests/CMakeLists.txt,
# which registers this with FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION; the measurement and the
# reasons live in `scripts/check-script-check-signals.cmake` and are deliberately
# not restated here (#565).

# Exercise scripts/ci-scope.sh against a throwaway repository.

# Registered as `ctest -R ci-scope`. It is NOT labelled `smoke`: it needs no
# daemon, no socket and no compiler -- only git, which every checkout already
# has -- so it belongs in the default set beside repository-hygiene and
# net-boundary.
#
# What it is here to stop: the classifier is what decides whether a pull request
# compiles anything at all, so a table that quietly starts answering `code=false`
# for a source path is a merge that no job ever built, on a pull request whose
# required checks all reported green. Both directions are therefore asserted, and
# so is every way of not knowing.

# `sccache-backend-caveat` must be SEEN to report what it cost, and seen to stay
# QUIET when there is nothing worth reporting.
#
# That check reads 800-odd files one at a time and does essentially no compute,
# so what it costs is set by the filesystem rather than by the check. A bare
# `ctest` timeout cannot say which of its known conditions a reader is looking
# at, so the check narrates its measured per-file cost once a run is already
# slow, and ctest captures the output of a test it kills. The figures and the
# conditions they were taken under live in `PaceSccacheScanCostBands` in
# the check itself -- pointed at, never copied here, which is the rule this
# whole change exists to enforce.
#
# That narration only ever runs on a filesystem slow enough to trigger it. On
# every machine where the check is comfortable it would have been merged
# untested and stayed untested -- and a fixture that has never completed has
# told you nothing. This drives it in milliseconds instead, against a synthesised
# tree, by overriding the two settings that decide when it narrates.
#
# The NEGATIVE cases are the load-bearing ones, and neither is obvious:
#
#   * A check that narrated UNCONDITIONALLY would pass a test that only proves
#     narration fires, while burying every green run in progress lines until
#     nobody reads the one that matters.
#   * A frozen clock reporting `0 ms/file` is a broken instrument reporting the
#     best possible filesystem. CMake returns `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` from every
#     `string(TIMESTAMP)` call, so that is one environment variable away at all
#     times, and a fast run and a dead clock are otherwise the same output.
#
# A negative assertion also passes for free against output that never arrived,
# so every case additionally has to have PRODUCED something. That is checked, not
# assumed: a subprocess that failed to start satisfies every `must not appear`
# needle in the table perfectly.
#
# What this does NOT do is judge the check's VERDICT. Reproducing a verdict-clean
# tree would mean restating that script's exemption and scan-root tables here,
# and a second copy of a table is not a cross-check -- it is a second thing to be
# wrong, and it would redden this fixture whenever an unrelated exemption row is
# added. The verdict is owned by `sccache-backend-caveat` itself against the real
# source tree; this owns the instrumentation, which nothing else watches. The
# cost line is deliberately printed BEFORE the verdict in that script, so it is
# present here whatever the synthesised tree makes it conclude.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check
# reports failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-sccache-backend-caveat-selftest.cmake

# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

set(PaceSelftestCrampedBudgetSeconds 15)

# The narration threshold and budget the QUIET case runs with, and the reason they
# are its own pair rather than the shared ones above (#1142).
#
# The quiet case asserts that the check narrates NOTHING. Narration starts once a run
# has already taken `PACE_SCAN_NARRATE_AFTER` seconds, so with the shipped
# default of 10 that assertion was a bet on this host completing the synthesised scan --
# 26 files, `PaceSelftestCorpusFiles` of filler plus the README and the snippet --
# in under ten seconds. Idle it takes about one; under `ctest --parallel 32` with another
# build on the box it crosses ten, the check narrates TRUTHFULLY, and the case reads a
# correct narration as a failure. Measured: 0 failures in 10 standalone runs at
# 1.05-1.38 s, against 1 in 3 at the gate's own parallelism where the passing runs took
# 15.56 s and 19.84 s. WSL2 over DrvFs, 32 CPUs.
#
# So the threshold is set far enough above the observed cost that it stops being a
# margin and becomes a different claim: that no host this project runs on is three
# thousand times slower than this one. A margin gets outrun -- which is what ten
# seconds was -- and a claim of that shape does not.
#
# THE CEILING IS DERIVED, NOT FREE. `check-sccache-backend-caveat.cmake` refuses any
# budget below twice the narration threshold, so these two move TOGETHER and the budget
# is what bounds the threshold. Raising the threshold alone would trip the very rule
# that `a budget too close to the narration threshold is refused before scanning`
# exists to enforce, and that case would go red instead of this one.
#
# So the ceiling on this threshold is HALF THIS BUDGET, and the way to raise one is to
# raise both. Reach for that invariant rather than for a bigger number on its own: the
# check's own refusal says "lower the narration threshold or raise the budget, and keep
# them moving together", which is the instruction it gives whoever trips it.
#
# They are a separate pair rather than a raise of `PaceSelftestBudgetSeconds`
# because that constant is shared by three other cases whose behaviour has no reason to
# move with this one.
#
# #608 is the same species in a different fixture and offers two remedies: stop depending
# on the threshold, or keep a margin large enough to be real AND still discriminate. THIS
# TOOK THE SECOND. The first is not available here -- freezing the clock is another case's
# subject and turns the outcome into `Cost NOT MEASURED`, which would destroy the headroom
# assertion this case also makes.
#
# And #608's weakening clause deliberately does NOT apply. There the threshold is DERIVED
# from the bound (`recent = bound / 4`), so raising the bound raises the quantity under
# test and the case asserts less. Here the threshold is a PRECONDITION of the quietness
# assertion rather than its subject, so raising it softens neither thing asserted -- it
# only makes "this run did not cross the threshold" reliably true instead of accidentally
# true. Same species, opposite consequence; do not transfer that clause here by analogy.
#
# IF THIS PROVES INSUFFICIENT, DO NOT RAISE IT AGAIN. Reduce the case to its load-immune
# half -- that headroom is reported at all -- and stop asserting quietness live. Climbing a
# constant twice is how a fixture ends up with a number nobody can justify and everybody
# trusts, and a case that tests less but never lies is worth more than one that tests more
# and flakes.

# EVERY case here pins the clock, and that is not tidiness.
#
# The third outcome this change adds means a backward step no longer produces a
# plausible-looking band -- it produces `Cost NOT MEASURED`, which removes
# `ms/file. That is the '`, the headroom line, `still scanning` and
# `narrated nothing` ALL AT ONCE. So a step landing inside a case that reads the
# host clock fails it, where before this change the same step left every needle
# present and the case passed on a wrong band. That is not a marginal exposure on
# the environment this ticket is about: the quiet case's own runs are recorded
# above at 15.56 s and 19.84 s under `ctest --parallel 32`, and WSL2 steps
# CLOCK_REALTIME back about 2 s every 32 s, so a 20 s window very likely contains
# one. A default-set `hygiene` test made flaky in the direction that reads as "my
# branch is bad" is the exact failure this whole check exists to stop.
#
# `1000,1000` is a clock that does not move: every interval measures 0, which is
# already what these cases arrange by setting their thresholds, so pinning changes
# what they PROVE not at all -- only whether the host can take it away.
#
# The two rows the epoch column covers need no pinning: the frozen case is decided
# from the environment before any interval is taken, and the cramped-budget case
# is refused before the scan starts.
#
# The four backward/forward rows are one discrimination each way, and no half of
# it is worth having alone.
#
# On the tree this ticket was filed against, the backward case reports
# `-93 ms/file. That is the 'native' band: A filesystem reached directly` and
# EXITS 0 -- the instrument whose only job is to say which filesystem condition
# the scan ran under, answering confidently, wrongly, and passing. So the
# `ms/file. That is the '` needle is asserted ABSENT here: it is present under the
# defect and absent under the fix, which is what makes it evidence.
#
# `narrated nothing` is deliberately NOT asserted absent in the backward case. It
# is absent under the defect too -- that absence IS the red #1313 was filed for --
# so a needle for it would pass either way and assert nothing. It is asserted
# PRESENT in the forward case instead, where it discriminates, and where it is
# also the exact string whose absence was the reported failure.
#
# The forward case is the other half for the reason a refusal always needs one: a
# guard nobody has watched ACCEPT is not known to work. Both cases drive the same
# injected clock and differ only in its DIRECTION, so a seam that had simply
# broken the check would fail the forward case rather than passing both.
#
# The third case exists because a mutation showed the first two could not see it.
# The two intervals can DISAGREE -- a step landing inside the directory walk
# leaves the whole-run interval positive -- and consulting only the run interval
# passed both cases above. `100,200,150` places exactly that: the walk starts at
# 200 and ends at 150 while the run goes 100 to 150, so the walk is -50s and the
# run is +50s. It also pins the message to naming WHICH interval stepped, which
# is the detail a reader needs and the one an `OR` of two flags loses.
#
# The fourth case is that same argument carried to its end, and it is the one the
# first three could not see. The check takes FOUR intervals, not two: a step
# landing in the READ phase -- which is where nearly all the wall time is -- shows
# up in a progress checkpoint's interval while the directory walk's and the whole
# run's both stay positive, so a flag built from those two discards a step the
# script has already SEEN and reports a band across it. Measured before the fix:
# `93 ms/file. That is the 'bridged and contended' band` at exit 0, for a run
# whose clock had demonstrably moved.
#
# The readings place exactly that. Ten 1000s cover the run start, the walk start,
# one per scan root and the walk end, so the walk measures 0s; the eleventh is the
# first checkpoint at 900 (-100s); the last repeats at 1100, so every later
# checkpoint and the run end measure forwards. Hence the second needle: narration
# is silenced per INTERVAL rather than per run, so this run DOES narrate, and a
# blanket `narration is off` in the refusal would be a confident wrong detail
# beside lines the same run printed.

# Which sense each substring field is asserted in, so the two assertion loops are
# one loop over a table rather than two blocks differing in a `NOT`.

# claim: `PurgeExpired` was correct and tested and had no production caller at
# all. This drives the real binary, so what is asserted is the composition in

# It also asks the three questions only a process can answer. "Unreadable" is a
# mode on a file, "absent" is a path that resolves to nothing, and "malformed" is
# a document the reader gives up on; each must produce its own named outcome
# rather than the nearest neighbour, because an operator reads the exit and the

# requires, leaving the file's own content the only thing under test.

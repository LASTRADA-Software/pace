# `macro-bare-parameters` is watched refusing AND accepting, against synthesised trees.
#
# ## Why the accepting direction is half the cases here
#
# A guard nobody has watched ACCEPT is not known to work, and this tree has a two-day
# instance of exactly that (#1031: a gate that failed closed and unconditionally, with
# a confidently worded false cause, whose accepting arm had on the evidence never once
# been observed). This check is the shape where that matters most, because the thing
# it must NOT refuse -- the identical line inside a `function()`, where it is correct
# -- is far more common in this tree than the thing it must refuse.
#
# So the cases below are deliberately weighted: one violation shape per construct, and
# five separate arms asserting that correct code is left alone.
#
# ## The case that exists because the census got it wrong first
#
# `elseif` is spelled out. The census that found this defect returned ZERO on its
# first run -- including the instance already in hand -- because its pattern was
# `(el)?if\(`, which spells "elif" and "if" and never "elseif". Both known sites are
# `elseif` lines, so a check with that bug would report a clean tree.
#
# `elseif-only` therefore stages a macro whose ONLY violation is on an `elseif` line,
# with the `if` above it correct. A checker that reads `elseif` as `if` finds nothing
# and this case goes red.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-macro-bare-parameters-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of the failure signal in the
# output.

# ## A FUNCTION, and this file is the reason
#
# It was a `macro()` first, and that cost exactly what this check exists to catch --
# one level up, and in the harness FOR the rule.
#
# A macro's body is re-parsed with its arguments substituted TEXTUALLY, so a `${...}`
# inside an argument's VALUE is expanded a second time, against the macro's own
# parameters. The staged case bodies here are CMake source containing `${want}` on
# purpose, and this macro had a parameter called `want` -- so
# `if(${want} STREQUAL "yes")` was written to disk as `if(pass STREQUAL "yes")`.
#
# The case still passed. `pass` is not a parameter of the staged macro, so accepting
# it was the right verdict for the text that was actually staged -- and the text that
# was actually staged was not the text the case is named for. Four cases were staging
# a corrupted subject, and every one of them was green.
#
# Nothing found this by reading. It came out of the mutation matrix: deleting the
# `${...}` strip from the check changed NO case's verdict, and a property whose
# removal costs nothing is either dead code or a case that is not testing it.
#
# A function's parameters are variables, so `${body}` here is a value rather than
# text to re-parse, and the `${want}` inside it stays literal. `caseCount` and
# `failures` travel back by PARENT_SCOPE, which is the price and is worth it.

# reached anything -- and an expectation carried through the SAME parameter is
# rewritten in lockstep with the subject it describes. A pattern argument spelling
# `${want}` becomes `pass`, and then matches the corrupted subject perfectly. So no
# assertion phrased in terms of the harness's own parameters can see this, however
# it is written; the corruption edits the question and the answer together.
#
# What survives is a literal that names no parameter. Under textual substitution
# every `${...}` in a staged body either becomes a parameter's value or evaluates to
# empty, so the two characters `${` disappear from the staged files ENTIRELY. This

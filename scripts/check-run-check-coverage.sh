# Every hygiene check ctest runs as `scripts/check-<name>.sh` goes through
# `run-check.sh`.
#
# That scope is stated in the first sentence rather than left to the pattern
# below, because a scan is silent about what it cannot reach and silence reads
# identically to complete coverage (#492).
#
# What is OUTSIDE it is DERIVED and printed on every run, never listed here. A
# hand-kept exclusion list is #492 one level along -- exact about what its author
# remembered, silent about the rest -- and the first draft of this paragraph
# proved it: it named six scripts plus "the e2e fixtures", while
# `reactor-teardown-gate-selftest.sh`, `sccache-smoke.sh` and `tls-smoke.sh` were
# neither. `Audit` counts the uncovered invocations from the registrations
# themselves, so the number moves when the tree does.
#
# ## The gap this leaves, stated rather than implied
#
# The `cmake -P` REGISTRATIONS are not covered, and that is a decision with a
# residual rather than a clean boundary.
#
# This paragraph used to say that covering them "means a wrapper that takes an
# arbitrary COMMAND, which is a different tool and not a wider pattern". Half of
# that has since gone false and the other half was wrong, so it is corrected here
# rather than left standing: **a sentence saying something cannot be done
# instructs the next reader not to try**, which is the expensive shape the
# rulebook records for `## Open work` entries.
#
#   * `run-check.sh --command -- <argv...>` EXISTS (#1103). It reports the same
#     four outcomes for any command.
#   * It is a MODE of the same script, not a different tool. Only the spawn
#     differs; the markers, the classification, the status pass-through and the
#     self-test are one object, and a second script would give a second spelling
#     of the marker -- which is what `run-check.sh`'s own header argues against.
#
# What remains is the mechanical half: the registrations still invoke
# `${CMAKE_COMMAND}` directly, so `outsideCMake` below is still a real count of
# real uncovered invocations. When they are routed through the wrapper, this
# check gains a second audit that REFUSES an uncovered `cmake -P` invocation
# instead of counting it -- and that refusal must land WITH the rewrite, never
# ahead of it, or it is red on arrival against a tree where none of them is
# wrapped yet.
#
# The hazard does not stop at the boundary, and the tempting argument that it
# does is wrong. It runs: a `cmake -P` check's verdict is read from its OUTPUT
# (`FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`, because a `message(WARNING)` exits 0), so a KILLED
# one prints no `CMake Error` where a FAILING one does, and the two are already
# distinguishable. That is true and it is not sufficient -- the tell is an
# ABSENCE, and "the only tell is the absence of output nobody is looking for" is
# the sentence at the top of `run-check.sh`. What the `cmake -P` half has is a
# positive signal for the failing case; what it lacks is one for the killed case.
# Weaker than the `.sh` collapse, where the two are identical in every respect,
# and still the same shape.
#
# So #1079 closed the total collapse and left the partial one open. #1103 is that
# residual: its wrapper half has landed, its registration half has not. A ticket,
# not a sentence here.
#
# ## Why this is a check and not a convention
#
# `run-check.sh` is what tells a check that was KILLED from one that FOUND A
# PROBLEM (#1079). A check registered without it reports the two identically, and
# nothing anywhere says so: the registration is valid CMake, the check is correct,
# and the only observable is a `***Failed` nobody can read. That is the state
# collapse the wrapper exists to remove, arriving through omission.
#
# ## The set is DERIVED, never listed
#
# From the ctest registrations themselves, because a hand-kept list is exact about
# the files it knows and silent about the ones it does not, and silence reads
# identically to complete coverage (#492). A script nobody registers is not in the
# set this ticket is about, so registration is the right source rather than a glob
# of `scripts/`.
#
# The rule is per LINE: a line naming `scripts/check-<name>.sh` must also name
# `scripts/run-check.sh`. That works because every registration here puts the
# script on its `COMMAND` line, and it is checked rather than assumed — a check
# whose path moved to a continuation line would show up as a violation rather than
# be skipped, which is the safe direction.
#
# **A COMMENT is not a call site**, so full-line comments are stripped first: two
# checks in this tree have matched their own headers and reported a step twice.
#
# `run-check.sh` itself does not match `check-<name>.sh` — after `check` comes a
# `.`, not a `-` — so the wrapper's own registration is not asked to wrap itself.
# That is a property of the two names, which is why the scan states its pattern
# rather than only its count: a pattern is broader than its author reads it as.

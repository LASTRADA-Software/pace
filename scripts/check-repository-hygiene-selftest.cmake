# `check-repository-hygiene.cmake`'s four ways of not having an index, driven apart.
#
# The check printed two different sentences for two of them and returned 0 from both,
# so ctest scored them identically: `SKIP: git could not answer here` and
# `SKIP: ... is not a git work tree` were one verdict wearing two words (#1565).
#
# ## The distinction the seam cannot draw
#
# `pace_work_tree_state` answers in three words, and `no-git` is three situations:
#
#   * git is not installed, or cannot run at all;
#   * this directory is in no repository -- an exported source tarball;
#   * this directory IS a checkout and git cannot follow its `.git`.
#
# `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` exits 128 for the last two alike and says "not a
# git repository" to both, so no amount of reading its answer separates them. What does
# is a fact the directory carries and the seam never asked for: whether `.git` is there.
#
# The third is the one that must not skip. A tarball has no index and never will; a
# checkout git cannot read is a broken host, and a check with no directory-walk fallback
# that skips there has reported NOTHING about a tree it was pointed straight at.
#
# ## Each case arranges its state, and asserts WHICH one it got
#
# A case that merely asserted "refused" or "skipped" would pass on the neighbouring
# state, which is the whole defect: the two sentences were already different and the
# VERDICTS were not. So every case matches the sentence as well.
#
# ## Read from the OUTPUT, never from the exit code
#
# `message(WARNING)` exits 0 on every CMake while printing `CMake Warning`, and this
# check's own SKIP path exits 0 while printing `SKIP: `. The exit status can carry
# neither distinction. Flattened first, because CMake wraps its diagnostics at a column
# that depends on the scratch path's length.

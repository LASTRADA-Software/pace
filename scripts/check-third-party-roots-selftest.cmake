# `third-party-roots` must be SEEN to refuse, on each thing it claims, and seen to accept
# what it does not claim (#1370).
#
# The cases that matter most are the POSITIVE CONTROLS: one tree-wide enumerator of each
# spelling in the check's table, in a file that does not read the roots, each refused by
# `path:line` and spelling. A spelling nobody has watched refuse is a row of decoration.
# Beside them, the shapes the first versions of the check got wrong while it was written:
# a recursive glob over a literal name, a comment satisfying "reads the roots", a CMake
# `ls-files` whose pathspec is on the next line, and a shell line continued with `\`.
#
# And both READERS of `scripts/lib/third-party-roots.txt` -- bash 3.2 and `cmake -P` -- are
# driven over the same files and must agree: on the roots of a valid file, and on refusing
# a missing, empty or malformed one. Two readers of one format are two parsers, and they
# drift exactly where nobody compares them.
#
# A bracket argument drops the newline right after its opening `[=[`, so a fixture
# written that way starts on the NEXT line and its line numbers count from there.
#
# THIS FILE IS ITSELF SCANNED by the check it tests, so its fixtures cannot spell an
# enumerator or a reader call literally: its own text would then be a site, or a reader,
# by construction. Every such word goes through a placeholder expanded at write time
# (`PaceFixtureWords`).
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports
# failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         [-DPACE_BASH=<bash>] -P scripts/check-third-party-roots-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

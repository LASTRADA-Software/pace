# Every startup diagnostic `docs/operations/corrupt-store.md` quotes VERBATIM is
# still composable by the source that composes it.
#
# ## The failure this exists for
#
# That page's whole purpose is that an operator meeting `Corrupt` does NOT delete
# a healthy cache -- the rulebook is explicit that `Corrupt` is what makes
# somebody do that. Its usefulness rests entirely on the operator recognising
# their own console output in it. A refactor that changed `context=` or dropped
# the shard path would leave the page silently wrong, every test green, and the
# operator without the identification the page exists to give them (#633).
#
# Measured when #633 was filed: of the diagnostics the page quotes, exactly one
# was asserted anywhere. `CowTreeStorage_test.cpp` compares the `StorageError(...)`
# rendering exactly; `grep -rn "failed to open" --include=*_test.cpp src/` returned
# nothing at all.
#
# ## Why a docs-subject check rather than unit tests
#
# The sentences are composed in `src/apps/`, and the daemon's `StorageOpenFailure`
# sits in an ANONYMOUS NAMESPACE in `main.cpp` behind
# `add_executable(fastcached main.cpp)` with no test target anywhere -- so it is
# unreachable by unit test without restructuring the app. A check that READS BOTH
# SIDES needs no linkage at all, dodges the anonymous namespace, and covers the
# node's half too, which lives in a different binary again.
#
# The mechanism is the STORE lane's recommendation; the analysis in #633's thread
# is theirs.
#
# ## What is asserted, and what deliberately is not
#
# **Presence in the composing source, never equality with a formatted line.**
# #633 is explicit that a whole-line assertion is a change-detector, which is the
# thing it exists to avoid. So:
#
#   * for the `StorageError(...)` rendering the WHOLE format string is asserted,
#     and that is not a contradiction. The rendering IS the page's verbatim quote,
#     so a change-detector is exactly what it needs, and the literal moves with
#     the page.
#   * for the shard sentence the PATH'S PRESENCE is the field-level assertion --
#     the `'{}'` that carries the one damaged file. Asserting the whole shard
#     sentence would be the change-detector #633 warns about.
#
# Rewording the prose around a quote is free. Changing `context=`, dropping the
# `'{}'` that carries the path, or losing the `refusing to start` suffix is not.
#
# ## The node's sentence is composed in THREE places
#
# `--cache-dir {}` and `cannot open {}` in `CacheTier.cpp`, and `refusing to
# start` in the node's own `main.cpp`. A check that read only the tier would miss
# the suffix entirely, which is why the table below is per-FRAGMENT rather than
# per-sentence.
#
# ## The set is DERIVED from the page
#
# The diagnostics come from the page itself -- every line that carries one of the
# shapes it uses to show console output -- never from a list restated here. The
# table explains which source composes which FRAGMENT, and a diagnostic no row
# covers is REFUSED rather than passed over: an uncovered quote is exactly the
# silent gap this check exists to close.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-corrupt-store-diagnostics.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

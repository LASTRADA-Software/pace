# Every fixture handed a launcher runs it against a state directory of the run's own.
#
# The launcher records every invocation in `<state>/pace-cc/invocations.log`, and
# `-z` deletes that log. `<state>` is the DEVELOPER's -- `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, or
# `$XDG_STATE_HOME` / `$HOME/.local/state` -- unless the fixture says otherwise, so a
# fixture that does not either deletes their statistics or appends its own records to
# them. The Windows launcher e2e did the first on every run and three fixtures did the
# second, and none of them looked wrong from inside the fixture: the result was right,
# only somebody else's file had changed.
#
# The seam that prevents it is `e2e_launcher_state_enter` (scripts/lib/e2e-common.sh) and
# `Enter-E2ELauncherState` (scripts/lib/E2EEnvironment.psm1). It only protects a fixture
# that calls it -- and, in bash, calls it in order, after `e2e_begin` and before the
# launcher first runs -- so this is the scan that says which ones do. Each `.ps1` fixture
# ALSO scans its own launcher executions
# at startup (`Assert-E2ELauncherFixture`); this is the half that needs no fixture to run,
# and that sees a fixture which never imports the module at all.
#
# With `--self-test` (the `launcher-state-isolation-selftest` registration) it instead
# proves it can fail, against a planted tree, and DRIVES both seams, against a stand-in
# launcher and a stand-in caller whose log is present, empty and ABSENT -- the last being
# every CI runner, and the state a review found ended every `set -e` bash fixture without
# a word while every sentinel here was non-empty.
#
# In the default set, on every platform: it reads files, and the `.ps1` fixtures it is
# mostly about only ever run on Windows. Not part of `e2e-helpers-selftest`, which is not
# RUN on Windows. The PowerShell half needs pwsh and is a named skip without it.
#
# bash 3.2: macOS ships a 2007 /bin/bash and this runs in the default ctest set.

# A FIXTURE is anything the build hands a launcher: a script named by an `add_test` that
# passes `$<TARGET_FILE:pace-cc>` or any other `$<TARGET_FILE...:pace-cc>` --
# directly, or through a `set()` variable carrying it, to any depth and across files -- and
# any tracked script that declares a launcher parameter (`--launcher)` in a `.sh`,
# `[string]$Launcher` in a `.ps1`), registered or not. Each must call its language's seam,
# and a `.sh` fixture must keep its launcher variable to the seam's order
# (`_launcher_seam_orders`): not named above `e2e_begin`, only tested, messaged or
# rewritten -- never inside a command substitution -- between it and the seam, and no EXIT
# trap installed after the seam.
#
# Fails CLOSED on what it cannot classify: a launcher reference -- or a variable carrying
# one -- outside an `add_test`/`set` it can read, a block it cannot close, a registration
# naming no script, a registered script that declares no launcher parameter, a fixture in a
# language with no seam, a bash fixture calling no `e2e_begin`, a seam call naming no
# variable, and a variable never used after it.
#
# Its blind spots, failing OPEN: a fixture that runs the launcher without naming its
# variable -- by a path it re-derived or took from the command line a second time, through
# `${!name}` indirection, or from a function of a sourced library; and a launcher a
# registration reaches without naming `$<TARGET_FILE...:pace-cc>` or a variable
# carrying it -- a path spelled from the build tree's layout, or a `find_program` of its
# own. The seam's own checks -- a read-only
# guard, a positive control, and a caller-log check on every exit -- catch the first, per
# fixture, at run time; nothing here catches the second. One rule fails CLOSED where it
# could be wrong: in bash, a function defined BEFORE the seam that runs the launcher when
# called later reads as a use before the seam, and is refused.

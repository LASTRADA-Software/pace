# `.tsan-suppressions` says what it is for, and nothing checked it (#1266).
#
# The file's own header states two rules. Every entry is a known bug that is still
# open and must name the issue tracking it. Removing an entry is part of fixing its
# issue -- because if the fix lands and the entry stays, the next regression of that
# exact race is invisible, which is the failure the whole gate exists to prevent,
# rebuilt one layer up.
#
# Both rules were prose. `scripts/tsan-gate.sh` prints ThreadSanitizer's own
# `Matched N suppressions` header and, since it learned to, the per-entry lines under
# it -- so the DATA to check them against has been on the gate's stdout, unread, with
# no reader anywhere. The only two references to the file in this tree are the gate
# setting `TSAN_OPTIONS` and a comment in `tsan-canary-rate.sh`.
#
# ## A dead entry is the finding, and it is silent by construction
#
# A suppression that matches nothing is a rule that has stopped applying. It costs
# nothing today and it is a standing licence: the day that race comes back, it is
# suppressed and the gate is green. Nothing about a dead entry is visible in any
# output -- a total of 5 and a total of 5 with one entry contributing 0 are the same
# number, which is why the per-entry lines had to exist before this could be written.
#
# ## Four outcomes, not two
#
# `NOTHING-TO-RECONCILE`, `NO-DATA`, `RECONCILED` and a refusal are four states and
# this reports them apart, because three of them are ways of not having checked and
# collapsing any two makes a run that verified nothing read like one that did.
#
#   NOTHING-TO-RECONCILE  the file holds no entries. This is master's resting state
#                         -- the file is 34 lines of header and no rules -- so it is
#                         the answer this check gives most often, and it is the one
#                         most easily mistaken for a pass. It says so in as many
#                         words instead.
#   NO-DATA               entries exist and the log carries no suppression output, so
#                         nothing is known about them. Not a verdict either way.
#   RECONCILED            every entry matched at least once.
#   refusal               an entry matched nothing, the log names one the file does
#                         not have, or the header disagrees with the per-entry sum.
#
# ## Usage
#
#   check-tsan-suppressions.sh <source-dir> [--log <tsan-gate-log>]
#   check-tsan-suppressions.sh --self-test <source-dir>
#
# Without `--log` the entry rules are checked and the reconciliation is reported as
# NOT RUN, which is the third state again: an entry that names no issue is a defect
# in the file whether or not a sanitizer ran this week.
#
# Exit: 0 when nothing is wrong, 1 on a finding. The verdict is also in the OUTPUT --
# every terminal line starts with one of the words above -- because a wrapper reading
# only a status cannot tell NO-DATA from RECONCILED.

# End-to-end check of `pace-kv --migrate-storage`.
#
# What it covers that the unit tests cannot: the CLI wiring, and — the part that
# actually decides whether the feature works for an operator — that the flag
# converts the store files that are really there. `MigrateConfiguredStorage` and
# `ExistingStorePaths` live in `main.cpp`, which is in no test target, and a
# conversion that walked a different set of files than the daemon opens would
# report success while leaving the daemon refusing to start on the one it missed.
#
# Both shapes `--storage` can take are exercised: one file, and a directory of
# `shard-NN.cow`. The stores are created by the daemon itself rather than by this
# script, so the layout under test is the real one.

# left the daemon running and then deleted the store out from under it (#808).
# The hand-rolled poll this replaced did `kill "$pid"` before its own `fail`; the
# `wait_until` that replaced it does not, and no `e2e_on_fail` was set here.

# Fixed in the TRAP rather than at that one wait, because the leak is a property
# of every exit path out of `create_store`, not of the wait that happened to be
# the first one noticed.
#
# Reaped by `reap_background_jobs`, which takes every background job of this shell
# and is BOUNDED where the per-pid ledger and `kill; wait` it replaced were not: it
# escalates to SIGKILL and names a daemon that outlives even that rather than
# waiting on it forever, which is how a local gate once hung for 80 minutes in
# `compile-cache-e2e.sh`'s copy of this loop.

    # more than that window the daemon was killed partway through and the

    # `wait_until` rather than a fourth hand-rolled poll (#628). What that buys
    # here, beyond one copy fewer:
    #
    #   * The bound is 10 SECONDS rather than 100 iterations. The loop this
    #     replaces asked for 100 x `sleep 0.1` and called it 10 s, which it never
    #     was -- each pass also ran a `find` and a `kill -0`, so the real budget
    #     was 10 s plus whatever those cost, on that machine, that time. A budget
    #     nobody can state is one nobody can tune.
    #   * Expiry FAILS rather than falling out of the loop. The re-count that
    #     used to follow this existed only because running out of iterations and
    #     reaching the count were the same exit from a `while` -- a fixture
    #     timing out INTO a pass. It is gone because the shape that needed it is.
    #   * A death is reported when it is NOTICED and says the process died, with
    #     its exit status, rather than reading as a slow machine.
    #   * The cost of a successful wait is printed, so this budget can be set
    #     from data rather than guessed at generously. Measured: 0s and 1s for
    #     the one-file and four-shard callers, against the 10 s budget.
    #
    # The log argument is `-`, and that is a decision rather than an omission: it
    # means an expiry here can only ever report INCONCLUSIVE, since log growth is
    # the signal that separates slow from stuck. The daemon's output goes to this
    # fixture's own stdout, where CI already shows it -- capturing it to a file to
    # feed the verdict would take it out of the visible run to put it in a dump
    # that only prints on failure. A death is still reported exactly, because the

# Run the concurrency-bearing tests under ThreadSanitizer, and refuse to report a
# clean result unless the sanitizer is proven to be instrumenting and reporting.
#
# This is what the `clang-tsan` CI job runs. It can be run locally against any
# build directory configured with the `clang-tsan` preset:
#
#   cmake --preset clang-tsan
#   cmake --build --preset clang-tsan --target <each TARGETS row's binary> tsan-canary
#   bash scripts/tsan-gate.sh out/build/clang-tsan
#
# The binaries to build are the first field of each row of the TARGETS table
# below, plus `tsan-canary`, and they are deliberately not listed here. This
# line used to list them and did not grow when the table did, so whoever
# followed it built too few and the gate stopped at the first missing one,
# "not built". That refusal is the right way for a short list to fail, but a
# copy of the table is a second source of truth, and the table is the one this
# gate reads.
#
# ## Why this is a script rather than a `ctest` line
#
# Three reasons, in descending order of how much they cost when ignored.
#
# **A clean sanitizer run is not evidence until something proves the sanitizer
# would have gone red.** `cmake/portable/Sanitizers.cmake` documents a defect on
# this repository where the cache read ON, the configure log printed "Enabling",
# and `add_compile_options` received no `-fsanitize=` at all -- so the sanitizer
# presets had never once run a sanitizer, locally or in CI, and every signal an
# author would check said yes. A `ctest` invocation cannot tell that apart from a
# tree with no races. This script can, and refuses to.
#
# It asks that question twice, because it is two questions. An undefined
# `__tsan_init` reference in each artefact's OWN OBJECT FILES answers "was this
# artefact instrumented" -- the artefact actually under test, not some other build
# in the same tree, and not the sanitizer runtime the link pulled in. The canary
# answers "does the runtime detect and report" -- which `TSAN_OPTIONS`, a
# suppressions file, or a stripped runtime can each break while leaving the
# instrumentation intact. Neither substitutes for the other.
#
# The first question used to be asked of the BINARIES, and could not be answered
# there: `__tsan_init` is DEFINED by the runtime, so it is present whether or not
# any translation unit was instrumented (#472). See `AssertInstrumented`.
#
# Every way this refuses has a message of its own, because each is fixed
# somewhere different, and each was verified by making it happen rather than
# reasoned about:
#
#   the build directory does not exist    -> "build directory not found"
#   the suppressions file does not exist  -> "suppressions file not found"
#   a path here contains a space          -> "cannot carry a path with a space"
#   `nm` is unavailable                   -> "nm is required"
#   no COMPILE line carried -fsanitize    -> "instrumented nothing"
#   a target is not built                 -> "not built"
#   a target's object dir is missing      -> "no <target>.dir under"
#   two dirs could be a target's objects  -> "cannot tell which is current"
#   a target has no objects at all        -> "no object files under"
#   an object's symbols cannot be read    -> "nm could not read"
#   an object has no undefined __tsan_init-> "built WITHOUT ThreadSanitizer"
#   the canary does not go red            -> "the deliberate race was NOT reported"
#   the canary dies of something else     -> "reported no data race"
#   the canary runs past its deadline     -> "tsan-canary did not finish within"
#   the canary cannot be executed         -> "nothing proves the sanitizer reports"
#   a tag expression matches nothing      -> "tested NOTHING"
#   a target exits 0 with no assertions   -> "refusing to call that clean"
#   a target runs past its deadline       -> "did not finish within"
#   a target cannot be executed           -> "ran no cases at all"
#   an unsuppressed TSan finding          -> "reported an unsuppressed ThreadSanitizer finding"
#
# That last row said "reported an unsuppressed data race" while the code emitted
# it for EVERY warning kind. It is the right-hand column that makes this table
# worth having, so a row naming a phrase the code no longer prints is worse than
# no row: it is a grep that comes back empty on a run that did refuse (#1251).
#
# The right-hand column is what a reader GREPS the output for, so each phrase is
# contiguous in the message it names -- a phrase the code only emits across a
# newline and an indent identifies nothing. Which is also why the target's
# unstartable row says "ran no cases at all" and not the more natural "tested
# NOTHING": that string already discriminates the tag-expression row four lines
# up, and two refusals sharing the one phrase this list tells them apart by would
# make the list stop being able to.
#
# The last three arrived with #488, and each has a `--self-test` case. Not "as
# the rest do" -- five rows here have none, and saying otherwise would be this
# gate's own defect in the prose describing it. The canary rows exist because a
# killed canary used to fall through to "reported no data race", a different
# fault with a different fix, so it needed a row rather than a rewording.
#
# The list is enumerated HERE and nowhere else. An earlier version of it said
# "five refusals" in three files, in three different orders, having silently
# dropped the two that are hardest to reason about -- which is the same shape as
# every other defect this gate is about, in the prose describing it.
#
# The "tested NOTHING" one is what looks like paranoia and is not: a typo in the
# TARGETS table below runs zero cases, and every other signal in the run says
# clean.
#
# **The suite is scoped, and `ctest` has no vocabulary for the scope.**
# `catch_discover_tests` registers cases by NAME and this project's Catch2 (3.6)
# predates `ADD_TAGS_AS_LABELS`, so there is no ctest label to select on and the
# scope has to be a Catch2 tag expression (issue #312). Running the two binaries
# directly also collapses ~700 sanitized processes into two: measured at 1.2s and
# 17.6s against several minutes of per-process runtime startup.
#
# Those two figures are from BEFORE #316 widened the tag list, when the filter
# matched the smaller scope whose count is recorded beside TARGETS below --
# stated once, there, because a figure written twice in one file is two things to
# be wrong and they drift. They are kept because what they are cited for is the
# COLLAPSE, which a scope around two-fifths larger does not undo, and they are
# deliberately NOT restated as today's cost. Nobody has re-measured this on a
# quiet host, and a figure taken on a box running three other builds would be a
# worse claim than a stale one that says which scope it was taken at.
#
# The tag list is NOT self-evidently the right one, and it has been wrong twice.
#
# The first version, `[async],[consensus],[distributed]`, looks complete and
# silently excluded six of ten `Async/` test files, because the reactor and
# coroutine tests are tagged `[reactor]` and `[task]` and carry no `[async]`. It
# matched 511 cases and they passed. Nothing in the run could have said otherwise.
#
# The second, which those five tags fixed, was wrong about WHERE THE THREADS ARE
# rather than about how a directory is spelled -- so the check written to enforce
# the first correction could not see it (#316). `Async`, `Consensus` and
# `Distributed` are not the only places this tree spawns one: a census of
# `std::thread`/`std::jthread`/`std::async` over `PaceTest`'s own sources
# names NINETEEN files, and ELEVEN of them were selected by no tag here and sat
# in no directory `check-tsan-scope.cmake` scanned -- among them every threaded `Net/`
# test, which is the module `BlockingListener` lives in and therefore the module
# the one real race this gate has ever seen (#260) came out of. That race reached
# the gate only because `pace-node-tests` is run whole; a regression
# of it reached through a `Net/` unit test in `PaceTest` was selected by
# nothing. The scope now names those files, and the tags below are what SELECTS
# them.
#
# So the tag list is not trusted here. `scripts/check-tsan-scope.cmake` runs in the
# default ctest set and fails when a test in one of the scoped locations carries
# no tag this expression selects. It reads the expression out of the
# TARGETS table below rather than restating it, so the two cannot drift apart: a
# tag removed from that table is a tag that check stops accepting, on its next
# run. The two halves are independent and both are needed -- this table decides
# what RUNS, that file decides what is CLAIMED, and a claim with no matching tag
# is a case nobody sanitizes.
#
# **Known-open races need somewhere to live.** `.tsan-suppressions` is that place
# and every entry names an issue; see the header of that file for why an entry is
# a liability rather than a fix.

# This is not an e2e fixture and uses none of the rest -- no port is drawn and no

# `fatal` annotates for GitHub Actions where `fail` does not, and `note` prints a

#
# WHICH MEANS `fail` IS NOW IN SCOPE BESIDE `fatal`, and a refusal added later and

# Nothing catches that -- `check-e2e-helpers.sh`'s collision scan looks for a

# The scope. One row per binary: the executable, the Catch2 tag expression it is run

# target is adding a row.
#
# `scripts/check-tsan-scope.cmake` PARSES this table -- keep the
# `"name|tagExpression|links"` shape, or that check fails by name rather than silently
# enforcing an empty scope. The tag expression is everything between the FIRST `|`
# and the LAST, so an expression may hold a `|` of its own; a declaration may not.
#
# THE LINKS COLUMN is a declaration `AssertLinkedLibrariesInstrumented` holds the
# build to (#134): `first-party` when the binary links a static library this
# project builds, or `none: <reason>` when it does not. A row declaring
# `first-party` whose link edge reads EMPTY is refused -- a broken read of the build
# graph, or a renamed library -- and so is a row declaring `none` that reads a
# library, since a stale `none` is how an uninstrumented library would come back.
# A rule concluding from "some row linked something" could see neither: the row
# that read wrong passes as long as another row read right.

# Which tag reaches which threaded file, so that a tag removed here is removed
# knowing what stops being sanitized (#316). Every `Net/` test file carries
# `[net]`, which is what lets the scope name that whole directory rather than
# picking threaded files out of it. The rest are per-file: `[sharded]` for
# `Cache/ShardedStorage_test.cpp` (the tree's one explicit concurrency stress
# case), `[expiry]` for `Cache/ExpiryReaper_test.cpp`, `[clock]` for
# `Core/Clock_test.cpp`, `[wait]` for `Core/BoundedWait_test.cpp` (#1446: the one
# test wait every threaded case above now goes through, and a case that waits on a
# helper thread to prove its account reaches the case's own thread. The other eight
# cases there are single-threaded, and a file row selects the whole file. Run under
# TSan before the row was added, on 300729f2, Linux, clang-tsan, with the gate's own
# TSAN_OPTIONS: 9 cases, 0 warnings, and the canary red at exit 66 in the same run),
# `[pubsub]` for `Protocol/RedisRespSocket_test.cpp`,
# `[server]` for the two threaded `Server/` files. `[reactor]` also reaches
# `Protocol/LiveStreamReactors_test.cpp`, one live-stats stream served on two real
# reactors (#1399) -- and `[livestats]` is deliberately NOT a row: its other cases
# drive one `TestReactor` on one thread, where ThreadSanitizer has no second thread
# to observe, so the tag would lengthen the run and read as race coverage it is not.
# Measured on 78582087, Linux, clang-tsan, `-DPACE_ENABLE_TLS=ON`, Catch2's own
# `matching test cases` line: this expression 903, with `[livestats]` added 921 --
# the 18 it would add are exactly its cases outside every tag here, 0 of them threaded.
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-11 on 9c5cc374, Linux, with `-DPACE_ENABLE_TLS=ON` --
# what the clang-tsan job passes, and the condition that decides the number:
# without it the same commit builds 830 rather than 848, so counts taken at the
# two settings were never comparable. Read from Catch2's OWN trailing
# `N test cases` line:
#
#     before this widening   608
#     after                  848      about two-fifths more
#     [net] 134, [tls] 19, union 139  (14 carry both; 5 carry `[tls]` alone)
#
# The conditions are PINNED here rather than pointed at. They are one tree at one
# instant, so a comment that tracked its source would one day claim this
# measurement had been taken under conditions nobody measured it under.
#
# WHICH QUANTITY, as well as which conditions -- this comment previously said
# "612 cases selected before, 871 after", in the language of selection, and those
# were STATIC counts over the sources rather than what any binary selects. 612
# still reproduces exactly that way; 871 reproduces neither way (the static count
# is 861 today). A source count and a binary count answer different questions --
# platform-guarded cases exist in one and not the other -- so a figure that does
# not say which it is invites exactly the reconciliation that cannot succeed, and
# one was attempted against these across two platforms before they were re-taken.
#
# NOT counted by counting indented `--list-tests` lines. That reports about
# DOUBLE the figures above, because each case prints a name line and a tag line.
# A lane that measured it that way undercounted its UNFILTERED total by exactly
# the untagged cases while every FILTERED figure came out right, so the error hid
# in precisely the numbers being used and showed only in the total.
#
# Two things the obvious reading of the above gets wrong, both measured rather
# than reasoned. `Net/` holds 152 TEST_CASE-family macros in SOURCE, more than
# the union above selects: the difference is cases behind platform guards this
# Linux build does not compile, so the gap is two different questions rather than
# an error, and a reader reconciling the two numbers should expect it.
# And the five `[tls]`-only cases are neither all `TlsContext` nor all in `Net/`
# -- two are `CliParser: --tls captures cert and key paths` and a `Server:` TLS
# metrics case -- so `[tls]` reaches a little outside the directory it is named
# for. This paragraph said "three `TlsContext` cases" until it was asked.
# THE THIRD ROW, and why it is run whole (#1209). `pace-cc-tests` was in no
# row: the launcher does not link the Pace library, so it is a separate
# binary that the two rows above cannot reach however the tags are written. Its
# concurrency is one file, `src/apps/pace-cc/CompileJob_test.cpp` -- jthreads
# over `OverlappingEchoRunner::Overlap` behind a `std::latch`, and a toolchain
# replacement landing mid-compile against a dangling iterator -- so a tag
# expression would buy nothing here: the whole binary is 3 s sanitized, measured
# three times, against 18.8 s for the two rows above. A tag scope is what you
# reach for when running everything is expensive, and here it is not.
#
# MEASURED BEFORE THE ROW WAS ADDED, which is what #1209 asks for -- a row added
# blind turns this job red for the next person. On 9a01737b, Linux, clang-22,
# `-DPACE_ENABLE_TLS=ON`, `detect_deadlocks=0`:
#
#     objects carrying an undefined `__tsan_init`   82 of 82
#     whole binary, gate's own TSAN_OPTIONS         exit 0, 716 cases, 0 warnings
#     40 runs of `[compile-job]`                    40 clean, 0 findings
#
# **That last line is a bound, not an absence.** Zero findings in forty runs puts
# the per-run rate under roughly 7% at 95%; it does not say there is no race, and
# a latch-driven window is exactly the shape that hides below such a bound. #1209
# predicted this first sanitized run would report races the way widening the tag
# scope did (#1207, #1208). It did not, and that is worth stating as a measurement
# rather than as a conclusion about the code.
#
# **It declares first-party since #178**, which gave the launcher's shared sources an
# Ed25519 verifier -- the worker half checks a lease's signature -- and with it ONE
# first-party archive, `fastcache-monocypher`. It still links no Pace library; what
# the row now asks is that the archive it does link was instrumented, which a "none" row
# would have waved through unasked.
#
# The instrumentation figure is the one that cannot be read off the binary: the
# link pulls in the sanitizer runtime whole, so `__tsan_init` is present in an
# executable whose translation units carried no `-fsanitize=` at all (#472). It is
# the OBJECTS that answer, and the reading was controlled in both directions -- a
# plain TU compiled without the flag reads 0 and the same TU with it reads 1.
# **`[async]` and `[task]` left the first row with #1596**, because the cases they selected --
# the coroutine vocabulary and the reactors in `Async/` and `Net/` -- left for core-cpp, and a
# tag that matches nothing is exactly what this gate refuses below. The code they exercised is
# still under this gate: it is linked here as core-cpp's archives, which the instrumentation
# check above reads by name, and its own tests are core-cpp's to run under its `clang-tsan`.
#
# **`[host-events]` joined the first row MEASURED, not blind**: the host-event hub hands a delivery
# turn between producer threads and waits on a condition variable in `Unsubscribe`, and the network
# relay delivers from a thread of its own. Linux, clang-22, a Debug `ENABLE_SANITIZER_THREAD`
# build, this gate's own TSAN_OPTIONS and suppressions file: the four host-event objects each carry
# an undefined `__tsan_init`, the canary exits 66 with its race reported, and 20 runs of
# `[host-events]` (15 cases) came back clean with 0 warnings. A bound, not an absence.

# What this gate DID, one entry per row of TARGETS above.
#
# The gate is fail-fast and stays that way: a sanitized run is expensive, and

# What was missing is not perseverance, it is the ACCOUNT.
#
# Every failure path in `RunTarget` ends in `fatal`, which exits -- so when the
# first target reports a race the second never runs, and the only thing printed
# names the first. **Skipped, absent, unstarted and failed are four states**, and
# this gate rendered the first three as one: silence.
#
# The states, and why the fourth is not padding:
#
#   not-run    the gate stopped before this target; it has reported NOTHING here
#   running    this target STARTED and no verdict was reached -- a killed or
#              timed-out run. Distinct from not-run because "did not run" would
#              be a LIE about a target that ran for ten minutes, and the two are
#              diagnosed in different places (#584 is this state one level up)

# Declared EMPTY and never pre-filled: `TargetPairs` reads an absent entry as

# `exitcode=66` is TSan's default and is named rather than assumed: this gate
# decides on the exit code, so it must not be something a stray TSAN_OPTIONS in

# canary included, so a suppression that has started matching more than it was

# that happens on every run, and it only does if it is set in one place.
#
# EXPORTED rather than written as a `TSAN_OPTIONS=... cmd` prefix on each run.
# The runs now go through `run_bounded`, which is a shell FUNCTION, and an
# assignment prefixing a function call is a corner of the language whose scope
# and export rules differ between POSIX mode and bash's default -- on a gate
# whose whole subject is not relying on unexercised behaviour, an `export` that
# is unambiguous on every shell is worth more than a shorter line. It reaches
# `nm` and `find` too, which read none of it.
# `detect_deadlocks=0` turns off TSan's LOCK-ORDER detector, and only that. The
# race detector -- this gate's whole subject -- is untouched, which is asserted
# rather than hoped: the canary still dies with exit 66 under this flag.
#
# It is off because the detector is UNSOUND in the arrangement this gate uses.
# TSan identifies a mutex by its ADDRESS and never forgets one that has been
# destroyed, and running hundreds of cases in ONE process recycles stack
# addresses between them -- so two cases whose nested mutexes land on the same
# two addresses in swapped roles produce `lock-order-inversion (potential
# deadlock)` for objects that never coexisted. Measured on one pair here
# (`TestReactor::_mutex` then `ManualClock::_mutex`, an order the source never
# inverts): 9/40 and 11/40 in two samples with ASLR on, and 0/40 under
# `setarch -R`, which is what makes ASLR the confirmed variable rather than a
# story that fits. Reproduced standalone in 40 lines with no deadlock possible.
#
# NOT a `deadlock:` suppression, and that is the whole argument: a suppression
# names a FUNCTION while the colliding pair is a property of STACK LAYOUT, so
# the next collision is a different pair in different files and no finite list
# closes it -- while each entry would also blind that function to a real
# inversion. See #1251.
#
# What this does NOT say: that deadlock detection is worthless, or that master
# is unaffected. Master's `clang-tsan` has been green at job level over the runs
# checked, and the pair found here needs `[server]`, which only the widened
# scope selects -- but nobody has measured whether a pair inside the narrower
# expression collides, and that gap is recorded rather than read as safety.

# Every wait is bounded, which is this repository's oldest testing rule. Running
# the binaries directly rather than through `ctest` loses ctest's own per-test
# TIMEOUT, and TSan changes timing enough that a deadlock is a real outcome: the
# consensus and node tests do real socket and thread work. Unbounded, a hung case
# runs to GitHub's six-hour job limit with nothing saying which target stalled.
# Generous, because the honest measurements are 1.2s and 17.6s -- this is a
# deadlock detector, not a performance budget.
#
# BOUNDED BY `run_bounded`, NOT BY `timeout(1)` (#488). What stood here resolved
# `timeout` then `gtimeout`, justified by two claims that were both false: that
# macOS needs the fallback, and that "this preset runs there". The `clang-tsan`
# job is `runs-on: ubuntu-24.04`, so the fallback had never executed anywhere --
# untested by construction rather than by oversight -- and what GitHub's
# `macos-14` image actually ships is measured and recorded in `run_bounded`'s own
# header, which is neither binary. That measurement is deliberately NOT restated
# here: a figure with two homes loses its conditions at one of them, and this
# paragraph being cited as established knowledge is precisely how it sent #457's
# bounded probe the wrong way.
#
# So the resolver is deleted rather than documented. `run_bounded` needs no
# binary, so there is no platform to refuse and nothing to resolve -- and this is
# not one unexercised path swapped for another. Its expiry, its unstartable case
# and its ceiling being wall-clock are driven by `ctest -R e2e-helpers-selftest`,
# which is in the DEFAULT set under `if(NOT WIN32)` and therefore runs on the
# macOS job. That is strictly more than the resolver it replaces ever had.
#
# It also separates two facts one integer cannot carry, and not merely in
# principle. Catch2 exits `min(255, failed_assertions)`, so a suite that RAN to
# completion with 124 failing assertions exits 124 -- the same number `timeout`
# reports for a kill, which `RunTarget` below read as a deadlock that had not
# happened. The verdict comes from `e2e_bound_outcome`; the status is only the
# convenience.
#
# What `run_bounded` does NOT do is signal the process GROUP, and this is the one
# place the change is a REGRESSION rather than an improvement. GNU `timeout`'s
# manual documents `--foreground` as the way to stop children being timed out, so
# without it they are; `run_bounded` signals the direct child only, and says so
# (`ONE PROCESS DEEP` in its header). `pace-node-tests` spawns
# compilers and claims scratch roots, so on expiry a grandchild can outlive the
# target this gate killed.
#
# The obvious fear is that a survivor POISONS THE NEXT RUN by holding something,
# and that was checked rather than assumed, because it is the difference between
# a note and a defect. It does not, and not by luck: the two things a grandchild
# could hold are both already closed where they are taken.
#
#   * a scratch-root claim -- `ScratchClaim.cpp` opens its lock file `O_CLOEXEC`,
#     and its comment says why in these words: the `flock` lives on the open file
#     DESCRIPTION, so an inherited copy would keep the root claimed after the node
#     is gone and the next one would refuse, blaming a node that does not exist;
#   * this gate's own output -- `run_bounded` captures into a FILE rather than a
#     pipe, and unlinks it, so a surviving writer can neither block the read that
#     follows nor corrupt a later one.
#
# What is left is a compiler burning CPU until it finishes on its own, after a
# run that has already stopped with a named refusal somebody is reading. Real,
# bounded, and not worth changing how a SHARED helper signals to remove --
# `run_bounded`'s header rejects both routes on stated grounds: job control
# changes the calling fixture's own signal handling, and a watchdog firing after
# `wait` reaps can signal a REUSED pid.

#

# this whole script exists to refuse -- it would happily verify and run an

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Question one: is the artefact under test instrumented?
#
# ASKED OF THE OBJECTS, NOT THE BINARY, and that distinction is the whole of
# #472. `__tsan_init` is DEFINED by the sanitizer runtime, which the link pulls in
# whenever `-fsanitize=thread` is on the link line -- so `nm --defined-only` on a
# binary answers yes whether or not a single translation unit was instrumented.
# Measured, same source, two objects, two binaries:
#
#     inst.o   U __tsan_init  yes      inst  binary: __tsan_init defined = YES
#     plain.o  U __tsan_init  no       plain binary: __tsan_init defined = YES
#
# `plain.o` was compiled with no sanitizer flag at all and its binary passed the
# old proof. An object cannot borrow a symbol from a runtime it is not linked to,
# so the UNDEFINED reference is the one that means something. Same symbol as
# before; what changed is `--undefined-only` and looking at the object.
#
# WHY THAT MATTERED MORE FOR THE SUITES THAN FOR THE CANARY. An uninstrumented
# canary fails closed -- it exits 0, reports no race, and `AssertCanaryFires`
# refuses -- though it used to do so while blaming `TSAN_OPTIONS`, the
# suppressions file or the runtime, all three of which were fine. The test
# binaries had no such backstop: `RunTarget` checks the timeout, that the tag
# filter matched, and that assertions were reported, and not one of those can
# tell an instrumented run from an uninstrumented one. An uninstrumented
# `PaceTest` linked against the runtime runs, reports assertions, exits 0,
# and the gate prints `all scoped targets clean`. That is the silent fail-open,
# and it is why this check covers every artefact rather than only the canary.
#
# WHY `__tsan_init` AND NOT `__tsan_func_entry`. The latter is emitted per
# instrumented FUNCTION, so an object whose translation unit has no functions
# carries none -- six of `PaceTest`'s 135 are exactly that, the
# platform-gated `Iocp*`, `Kqueue*` and `Tls*` test files, which compile to
# nothing on Linux. A rule built on `__tsan_func_entry` needs an
# empty-TU exemption and would otherwise refuse a correct build. Those six DO
# carry `U __tsan_init` and a `tsan.module_ctor`: they were instrumented, there
# was simply nothing to instrument. Measured across the three targets, 185 of 185
# objects carry it and none needs an exemption.
#
# The existence check on the binary comes FIRST and stays. `nm` on a path that
# does not exist prints nothing, and "no symbols" is character-for-character what
# an uninstrumented artefact looks like; a missing file must not be reportable as
# a missing sanitizer, because they need different fixes.
#

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Question one, continued: are the first-party LIBRARIES a row links instrumented?
#
# `AssertInstrumented` reads the objects in the row's own `<target>.dir`, and a binary
# is more than those. The vendored TUI went unsanitized in every sanitizer
# configuration (#134) -- its targets were declared before the directory-scoped
# sanitizer options -- while this gate printed "pacectl-tests: instrumented
# (31 object files)": true of the 31, and silent about the static library holding
# the half of that binary the row exists for.
#
# DERIVED, never listed. The libraries are the static archives on the row's own link
# edge, read from ninja's record of the build (`ninja -t query`), and each archive's
# objects are the inputs of ITS edge. A hand list of "Pace and the TUI" is exact
# about the libraries it knows and silent about the next one, which is precisely how
# the TUI escaped the object check above.
#
# Which archives are FIRST-PARTY is also derived: an archive this build produced is
# third-party exactly when it sits under a dependency's binary directory as CPM
# recorded it in `CMakeCache.txt` (`CPM_PACKAGE_<name>_BINARY_DIR`). Those stay
# uninstrumented on purpose -- all but core-cpp's (#1596). The top-level CMakeLists.txt
# instruments core-cpp's libraries target by target, because its event loop and sockets
# are half of every race this gate exists to see, so its archives are asked about exactly
# as this project's are: its row is left out of the dependency record by NAME below. A path this build did not produce -- an absolute one,
# a system library -- is not asked about at all. So the classification is an
# INCLUSION by the build's own record rather than a pattern like `_deps/`: an
# archive nobody recorded as a dependency is treated as ours and checked, which
# fails CLOSED.
#
# A row linking no first-party archive is ordinary -- `pace-cc-tests` was one,
# compiling its few shared sources in, until #178 linked it the Ed25519 archive -- so it
# is REPORTED by name rather than refused. What is refused is the derivation coming back empty for

# What a finished Catch2 run REPORTED, read off its log. A pure function over a
# file, so `--self-test` can drive every arm without staging a build -- the shape
# `CanaryVerdict` was given for the same reason (#257): the DECISION a guard makes
# is what needs testing, and the acquisition around it is what makes the decision
# unreachable in a test.
#
# **CATCH2 HAS TWO SUMMARY FORMS, and the caller below knew one.** With nothing
# skipped or failed it prints
#
#     All tests passed (3843 assertions in 716 test cases)
#
# and with ANYTHING skipped it prints the table instead, and no `All tests passed`
# line appears anywhere in the output:
#
#     test cases:  716 |  715 passed | 1 skipped
#     assertions: 3843 | 3843 passed
#
# A single grep for `assertions in` therefore reads a perfectly healthy run with
# one skip as a run that REPORTED NOTHING, and the gate refuses to call it clean.
# A false RED, and a deterministic one rather than a flake: `pace-cc-tests`
# skips one case on every host with no MSVC-family driver, which is every Linux
# runner, so the third row of TARGETS could not go green on the platform this job
# runs on. The two rows before it happen to skip nothing, which is why the defect
# waited for a third (#1209). Essentially every skip site in this tree is
# environment-conditional, so what this bites is the constrained runner where
# coverage is already thinnest.
#
# TWO QUESTIONS, and they are answered separately because they are fixed in
# different places. Whether a summary was printed AT ALL says whether the binary
# ran to completion; whether it counts an assertion says whether it tested
# anything. Folded into one `-n` test they were indistinguishable, and the message
# named the second while firing for neither.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `--self-test`: drive this gate's refusals against staged artefacts.
#
# A guard that has never been seen to fire is the thing this repository keeps
# finding, and #472 is precisely that -- a proof that had never been shown to
# refuse anything, because it structurally could not. So each refusal is staged
# here and required to happen.
#
# TWO DECISION PATHS, TWO KINDS OF STAGING, and the section headers below say
# which is which. `AssertInstrumented`'s verdicts are driven against staged
# OBJECT TREES read through a stub `nm`; the bound's three outcomes (#488) are
# driven against staged EXECUTABLES, which need no stub, no objects and no
# symbol table at all. Neither needs a compiler or a sanitizer, which is what
# keeps the whole fixture in the default `ctest` set on every platform.
#
# THE ONE THAT MATTERS IS THE SUITE, NOT THE CANARY. An uninstrumented canary
# already failed closed before #472: it exits 0, reports no race, and
# `AssertCanaryFires` refuses. The test binaries had no backstop at all --
# `RunTarget` checks the timeout, the tag filter and the assertion count, none of
# which can tell an instrumented run from an uninstrumented one -- so a guard
# demonstrated only on the canary would be a guard nobody has seen fire where it
# matters. `suite-object-uninstrumented` is that case and is deliberately first.
#
# HOW THE OBJECTS ARE STAGED. `AssertInstrumented` asks exactly one question of
# each object: what does `nm --undefined-only` print. So a staged `.o` here is a
# TEXT FILE whose content is that output, and a stub `nm` earlier on PATH prints
# it. No compiler, no sanitizer runtime, no build -- which is what lets this run
# in the default `ctest` set on every platform rather than only where a TSan
# toolchain exists. It exercises the real decision code; only the reading of the
# symbol table is stood in for, and that half has no branches.
#
# The binary is a plain file, because `AssertInstrumented` only checks that it
# EXISTS. That is the point of #472 restated: the binary's own symbols answer
# nothing, so the gate no longer reads them, so a staged binary needs no symbols.

    # RunTarget's reading of the bound (#488).
    #
    # THE ONE THAT MATTERS IS 124, and it is deliberately first. `RunTarget` used
    # to decide from the exit STATUS, and 124 is two facts there: `timeout`'s "I
    # killed it", and Catch2's own `min(255, failed_assertions)` for a suite that
    # ran to completion and failed 124 assertions. The second was reported as the
    # first -- a deadlock diagnosis, quoting a bound the run never reached, for a
    # suite that had merely failed. Nothing could have caught it, because the
    # gate's only evidence was a number that means both things.
    #
    # The other two are the direction the ticket's reviewer asked about: a bound
    # that expires, and a target that cannot start, must each still be a REFUSAL
    # naming its own reason. A bound is not an improvement if it lets the gate
    # conclude "fine" from "I could not tell".
    #

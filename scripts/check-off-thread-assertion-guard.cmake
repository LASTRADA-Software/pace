# Every executable that links Catch2 carries `OffThreadAssertionGuard` (#1211).
#
# ## What this reads, and why not CMakeLists.txt
#
# The top-level `CMakeLists.txt` makes the guard an INTERFACE source of the Catch2 target, so
# it reaches an executable through the link rather than through a list. That is a CLAIM
# about what CMake will do; the artefact is the generated link line, and this reads it the
# way `check-error-popups.cmake` reads its own: from `build.ninja`, never from a list of
# targets. A Catch2 that arrives by a route the attachment does not reach -- a second copy,
# a target that stopped being the one resolved, a link that names the library by path --
# builds, runs and passes, and is wrong only on the run where a helper thread asserts.
#
# An executable LINKS Catch2 when its link edge for this configuration names the Catch2
# library itself (`libCatch2.a`, `libCatch2d.a`, `Catch2.lib`, `Catch2d.lib`, or a shared
# spelling -- VERSIONED included, `libCatch2.so.3.13.0` and `libCatch2.3.13.0.dylib`, which
# is how a distribution's Catch2 reaches the link line when `find_package` resolves it), at a
# boundary: `libCatch2Main.a` is a different library and is not the test. It is COVERED when
# the same edge names the guard's object.
#
# The versioned spelling was missing, and a Fedora Catch2 3.13 made every edge invisible: the
# check refused "nothing links Catch2" over nine binaries that each carried the guard. That
# direction is the loud one. The quiet one is a second binary on that spelling WITHOUT the
# guard, which an unrecognised spelling skips rather than refuses.
#
# ## Outcomes
#
# An executable that links Catch2 and is not covered is REFUSED, by name. So is every way
# of not being able to ask: no link edge that links Catch2 at all, an anchor (`PaceTest`)
# that is not among the covered, and an edge carrying a `;` or a `[`, which this reader
# cannot split safely. A generator that writes no `build.ninja` is a SKIP, naming it.
#

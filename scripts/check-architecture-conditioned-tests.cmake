# A test may not decide anything from the ARCHITECTURE it was compiled for.
#
# `#if defined(_M_ARM64)` in a test picks an expected value from a fact about the
# BUILD. The implementation it is testing picks its answer from the same fact. So
# both flip together, they agree on every machine CI owns, and the case is green
# under every build while being unable to fail for the reason it exists. That is
# `.agent/rules/testing.md`'s *assert what DISTINGUISHES, not what both sides
# produce*, with the preprocessor as the mechanism -- which is what makes it
# invisible to review, since both arms are in the diff and each reads correctly.
#
# It is not hypothetical. #146 was the MSVC bindir chosen by the architecture the
# binary was COMPILED for rather than the machine it RUNS on, and
# `ToolchainDiscovery_test.cpp` re-spelled the implementation's own condition to
# decide what to expect. A gate-class defect with a test pointed straight at it,
# which could not have caught it at any point.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why the OPERATING SYSTEM is deliberately out of scope
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is the part a later reader will otherwise re-derive, or "fix" by widening
# the scan -- so it is written here, in the file that does the refusing.
#
# `#if defined(_WIN32)` in a test is SOUND. A Windows build runs on Windows;
# build time and run time necessarily agree, so a per-platform expectation stated
# as a literal is a real fact about the arm it is compiled in, and inverting the
# implementation's arm breaks the test. Measured on this tree at the time this
# check was written: 35 of 215 test files carry a platform or architecture
# directive, and 33 of them are that legitimate shape -- per-platform fixtures,
# `int` versus `socklen_t` in a syscall, an error-code table, an environment
# variable the test itself SETS so the implementation must independently agree.
#
# `#if defined(_M_ARM64)` is NOT sound, and the difference is not stylistic. An
# x64 build runs on ARM64 Windows routinely, under emulation, so the condition is
# a PROXY for the machine rather than a fact about it. The test and the
# implementation then agree perfectly while both are wrong about the host they
# are running on.
#
# So a scan over platform directives generally would refuse 33 correct files, and
# a guard that refuses correct code is disabled -- taking the real finding with
# it. This one refuses none of them.
#
# The remedy exists only for architecture for the same reason: there is a runtime
# fact to inject a seam around (`IToolchainHost::NativeArchitecture()`), where for
# the operating system there is no build-versus-run gap to inject.
#

# What is deliberately NOT covered

#
# `Platform/HostInfo.cpp`'s `CompiledArchitecture()` is a documented OPPOSITE
# decision and must keep its `#if`: it answers *what can this process run*, for
# which the compiled answer is the correct one, because an x86-64 process under
# emulation executes x86-64 code however the kernel describes the machine. This
# check is scoped to `*_test.cpp` and so cannot see it, which is correct rather
# than an oversight -- do not widen the scope to implementation files.

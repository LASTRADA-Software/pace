# A test file does not define its own `IMembershipOracle`: the fakes live in
# `src/tests/MembershipFakes.hpp`.
#
# ## Why a check and not a sentence
#
# The rulebook already says it -- *"A test FAKE is a shared helper too:
# `src/tests/ScriptedSocket.hpp`. A fake nothing exercises does not report its own bugs."*
# That sentence reached the files that obey it and no file that did not: when #1497 was filed,
# six test files carried their own copy of one of two membership fakes, four of them
# byte-identical.
#
# What makes a duplicated FAKE worse than duplicated production code is the direction its bugs
# point. A fake that is wrong makes its cases pass -- it cannot make them fail -- so an
# assertion review finds nothing, a green suite says nothing, and the copy is discovered only
# when somebody happens to read it. That is precisely the population a check exists for.
#
# And the cost is not fixed: it is the number of FACTS each copy has to get right. That number
# was zero until #1471 gave the seam an attribution, and is now one -- each copy must name
# which admission route it stands for, and each is a separate chance to name the wrong one,
# which would make a case assert attribution it never established.
#
# ## What it matches
#
# Over each `*_test.cpp` with its comments removed (`fastcached_strip_comments`), so prose
# about the interface is not read as implementing it:
#
#   a `class` or `struct` whose base clause names `IMembershipOracle`, in any spelling
#   (`IMembershipOracle`, `Distributed::IMembershipOracle`, `Pace::Distributed::...`),
#   with or without `final`, and with or without an access specifier.
#
# The base clause is bounded by `[^;{]*`, which cannot cross a `;` or a `{` -- so the match is
# the declaration and nothing after it, and a declaration WRAPPED across lines is still one
# match. That is why this reads the whole file rather than walking lines: a wrapped base clause
# is exactly what a formatter produces once a class name grows, and a line-based reader would
# fail OPEN on it.
#
# It reports the class NAME rather than a line number, deliberately: a name is what you search
# for, and it does not drift when the file above it changes.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, said here so nobody over-applies it
#
#   * **Production oracles.** `OpenMembership`, `AnyOfMembership`, `LoopbackMembership`,
#     `KeyRosterMembership` and `NodeMembership` are the real implementations and are not test files. Only `*_test.cpp`
#     is scanned.
#   * **Using the interface.** A test that takes an `IMembershipOracle const&` parameter or
#     holds a pointer to one is the ORDINARY case and is untouched -- `NodeReload_test.cpp`
#     does both, on purpose. Only a DERIVATION is refused.
#   * **A fake of a different seam.** This says nothing about `ILiveStatsSources`,
#     `IClusterAdmin` or any other interface test files stub. Each would be its own decision,
#     and its own row if one is ever wanted here.
#   * **`vendor/`**, which is another project's code.
#   * A token inside a STRING LITERAL reads as code, as in every regex-shaped reader here.
#
# ## Its residual, so the next surprise is diagnosed rather than exempted
#
#   * FAILS OPEN on a base clause holding a `{` or a `;` before the interface name -- a
#     braced initializer or a nested template argument spelled that way. No such declaration
#     exists in C++ that this check would meet; widen the bound rather than exempting a site.
#   * It cannot tell a fake that SHOULD be shared from one that genuinely belongs to one file.
#     That is what the exemption table is for, and a row has to say which.

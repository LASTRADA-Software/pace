# The markup escaping convention has ONE home, and nothing else spells its entities.
#
# `&amp;` `&lt;` `&gt;` `&quot;` `&#39;` are what an XML-family document writes instead
# of the five bytes it cannot carry. They belong in `Core/Markup.hpp`'s table and
# nowhere else: a fleet page, a launcher report and a launchd plist all reach that one
# escaper (#1359).
#
# ## Why this check and not a walk over the shared function
#
# This is the part worth reading, because the obvious guard here is vacuous.
#
# #1334 shared only a TABLE, so each consumer kept its own walk and could drift from
# the rows — which is what a test walking the table catches. #1359 shared the
# FUNCTION, so that drift cannot happen: every consumer calls `EscapeMarkup`, and a
# test over `EscapeMarkup` would keep passing no matter how many new escapers appeared
# beside it, because the shared function is correct by construction.
#
# The failure mode that survives consolidation is somebody writing a **new** escaper
# and re-pointing call sites at it. Nothing about the shared function can see that. The
# instrument that can is the census that FOUND the three sites in the first place: look
# for the emitted ARTEFACT — the entity spellings — rather than for the implementation
# shape. A table-shaped census is blind to a `switch`-shaped duplicate by construction,
# and that asymmetry is exactly how the original sweep first mischaracterised this as a
# trivial difference of tables.
#
# So this is the acceptance clause of #1359 rather than decoration: *change one row at
# one site and something goes red naming that site.*
#
# ## `&apos;` is banned outright, and that is the sharp end
#
# The consolidation retired `&apos;` in favour of `&#39;`. Both are valid references
# for U+0027, nothing reads the spelling back, and one table with no per-consumer
# column was chosen over two tables. A reappearing `&apos;` is therefore not a style
# question: it is the drift this check exists to refuse, arriving in the exact shape it
# arrived in last time — a second escaper, in a target that did not want to reach the
# first one.
#
# ## What may spell them, all three answers derived rather than listed where possible
#
# 1. **The home**, found by searching for the table's definition rather than by
#    carrying a path — so the check cannot end up excusing a file that has moved.
# 2. **A comment**, stripped before matching. `Distributed/FleetView.cpp` mentions
#    `&amp;` in a sentence explaining the escaping and calls the shared helper 28
#    times; a check that refused the documentation of its own rule gets deleted rather
#    than obeyed.
# 3. **A `*_test.cpp`**, by suffix. A test of an escaper must spell what the escaper
#    emits, and there is no other way to assert it. THE LIMIT, stated rather than
#    discovered later: a test could hand-roll an escaper and this would not see it.
#    That is deliberate and it is sound for the hazard — a test escaper ships to
#    nobody, and the subject here is a second escaper reaching a DOCUMENT.
#
# Everything else needs a row in `ExemptionTable` with a reason, and a row that has
# stopped describing a real occurrence is refused as STALE — an exemption nobody has
# re-read is how a list stops describing the tree it governs.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`: it reads files, compares strings and reports. See
# `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports failure through its
# OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-markup-entities.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

# Every place that documents how to configure the tidy sweep's compile database
# must document what the `clang-tidy` CI job actually configures.
#
# ## Why this is a test and not a review note
#
# `scripts/tidy-sweep.sh` opens by saying it is "for reproducing what CI will
# say". A person who wants that reads its header and runs the line it prints.
# Until #454 that line was hand-rolled and had drifted -- in compile flags and in
# target set, in both directions at once, so a local sweep both invented findings
# CI suppresses and stayed silent on findings CI raises. **The measurements are in
# `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md`** beside the configure line itself; they
# are deliberately not restated here, because a figure restated in four places is
# a figure that gets updated in one.
#
# Nothing else connects the workflow to the files that document it, and the
# rulebook had carried the target-set rule twelve lines above a code block that
# violated it -- so "the comment says so" is demonstrably not enough.
#
# ## Derived, not tabulated -- twice
#
# CI's line is READ from `.github/workflows/build.yml` rather than restated here.
# A second copy would not be a cross-check, it would be a second thing to be wrong
# -- the reasoning `scripts/check-tsan-scope.cmake` records for reading the TSan
# gate's tag expression instead of repeating it.
#
# And WHICH files document a line is discovered by scanning for the sweep's own
# database directory, never by a list. #492's rule: a list is exact about the
# files it knows and silent about the ones it does not, and silence reads
# identically to complete coverage. A guide or a README growing a third copy of
# the configure line is exactly the drift this check exists for, and a two-entry
# list would pass green forever while it rotted.
#
# One file is named, and only one: `scripts/tidy-sweep.sh` must be among the sites
# found. That is not a tabulated set, it is the assertion that the header this
# check was written for still documents anything at all -- a scan alone would go
# quietly green if that header lost its configure line entirely.
#
# ## What it compares, and what it deliberately ignores
#
# The preset name and the `-D` options as a SET, values included: order and line
# wrapping are not the contract. `-B` is ignored as a value here because the scan
# anchor already pins it -- a documented line that does not name the sweep's
# database directory is not found as a site at all, and `tidy-sweep.sh` defaults
# `DB` to that same directory. CI needs no `-B` because its runner has no
# `out/build/clang-debug` tree to protect.
#
# ## What it cannot assert, stated rather than left as an apparent omission
#
# Command equality is not database equality. `clang-debug` names bare `clang++`,
# and `cmake/portable/PedanticCompiler.cmake` adds each warning flag only if
# `check_cxx_compiler_flag` accepts it -- so following the documentation perfectly
# on an older clang still yields a flag set that can differ from CI's, along the
# very `clang-diagnostic-*` axis #454 is about. The rulebook pins the ANALYSER's
# version; the CONFIGURING compiler is whatever `PATH` offers. Unchanged by #454
# and not made worse by it, but not closed by this check either.
#
# ## When #615 lands, this check must change with it
#
# Verbatim duplication of the workflow's line is right only under the constraint
# it was written under: `build.yml` was held by another pull request, so a
# `tidy22` configure preset could not have been adopted by CI in the same change
# and would have become a FOURTH copy rather than a consolidation. #615 carries
# the permanent fix, and says it must be taken by whoever can change `build.yml`
# in the same change.
#
# The moment CI configures a preset instead of a preset-plus-five-`-D`s, this
# check starts failing -- CORRECTLY, and confusingly, because the documentation
# it is comparing will still be right. It is not the thing to delete then: point
# it at the preset both sides name. Written down here because the person doing
# that will arrive at a red check before they arrive at #615.
#
# ## Usage
#
#   bash scripts/check-tidy-sweep-database.sh              # check the tree
#   bash scripts/check-tidy-sweep-database.sh --self-test  # prove the check bites
#
# Spelled with `bash` because the file carries no execute bit, exactly as its
# sibling checks do and as `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` invokes it. A usage line
# promising a direct invocation is a usage line that answers `Permission denied`.
#
# bash 3.2: macOS still ships a 2007 /bin/bash and this runs in the default ctest
# set on every platform CI builds. No `mapfile`, no `declare -A`, no `${var^^}`.

# The `run:` body of a named step inside a named job, folded to one line.
#
# Indentation is the discriminator, and it is reliable because this is the
# repository's own workflow: a job key is two spaces, a step's `- name:` is six,
# its `run:` eight, and a folded scalar's continuation ten. The job scoping is
# load-bearing rather than defensive -- `build.yml` carries a step named
# `Configure` in a dozen jobs.
#
# It deliberately carries NO `/^[ \t]*#/ { next }` rule, which both sibling
# walkers (`check-merge-queue-contexts.sh`, `check-gated-jobs.sh`) do have. Inside
# a `>-` block scalar a `#` is literal shell payload, not a YAML comment, so
# skipping those lines would silently truncate the very `run:` body being read --
# and a truncated command still compares as a command. Stated because the omission
# looks like an inconsistency, and tidying the three walkers into agreement is
# exactly how it would get "fixed" back into a defect.
#
# Two boundaries are load-bearing and neither is the one that looks obvious:
#
#   * A STEP ends at the next `- ` item whatever key introduces it, not at the
#     next `- name:`. An unnamed step -- `- if: failure()` carrying its own
#     `run:` -- would otherwise still be `pending` from the last `- name:`, and
#     its command is folded onto the one being read. A `run: cmake --build
#     --preset …` there yields two preset names and fails a correct tree.
#   * A BLANK LINE inside a `>-` / `|` scalar is part of the scalar (it folds to
#     a newline); it does not end it. Ending collection there dropped every
#     option after the blank, and -- see the paragraph above -- a truncated
#     command still compares as a command. The body ends at the dedent.

# NAME comes from the record rather than a re-derived `- name:` match -- which is

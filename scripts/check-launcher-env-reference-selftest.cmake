# `launcher-env-reference` must be SEEN to refuse, on each thing it claims, and SEEN
# to accept -- a guard nobody has watched accept is not known to work, and on a tree
# where the two files already agree (they do, at 17 names each) the refusing direction
# is the only one a green run ever exercises.
#
# Four of the cases are the check's own claims rather than decoration:
#
#   prose-only     a variable NAMED in the page's prose but given no table row must
#                  still be a violation. The page mentions these names dozens of
#                  times outside the table, so a reader matching mentions rather than
#                  rows would report a documented set that includes every variable
#                  anybody ever wrote a sentence about.
#   bracketed      the page is markdown and every other line carries a `[link](target)`.
#                  This case puts brackets on and around the rows, and the check must
#                  still agree -- the property `file(STRINGS)` would not have.
#   empty-header   } two empty lists agree perfectly, so a scan matching nothing must
#   empty-page     } REFUSE. This is the failure mode the check exists inside of.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check
# reports failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-launcher-env-reference-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

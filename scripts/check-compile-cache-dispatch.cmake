# Whether configure's `[cache] dispatch` line is TRUE of the build it generates, and whether the
# two settings the configure environment SEEDS stay where a `-D` put them.
#
# pace-cc dispatches a miss to a compile fleet when `PACE_SCHEDULER` names one, and it
# read that only from the environment of whatever ran the build. So a developer who set it in one
# shell and built from another got a build that compiled everything locally, with configure having
# said only that pace-cc was the launcher: measured on a workstation, 341 misses and
# `NOT_CONFIGURED` on every one of them, found from a fleet dashboard reading 0 compiling.
# `cmake/portable/CompileCache.cmake` now decides dispatch at configure, holds it in the cache,
# bakes it into the launcher and says which way it decided (`_pace_hold_setting`,
# `_pace_dispatch_state`). `PACE_ADDR` is held by the same rule: the environment seeds a tree
# with no entry, and a later difference is REPORTED and never applied, because a rule that let
# the environment retarget a held value could not see a `-D` typing the value already held.
#
# Two halves, because a configure's OUTPUT is the module's CLAIM and the generated buildsystem is
# the artefact a compile runs (#187):
#
#   1. The DECISION, as a pure computation over every combination of a cache entry and the
#      configure environment -- including the ones a shell cannot easily stage. A failure here is
#      reported and half 2 still runs, so one broken function does not hide what the wiring does.
#   2. The WIRING: the fixture project configured with a stand-in pace-cc, in sequences that
#      reconfigure one build tree the ways a real one is reconfigured -- by hand with and without a
#      `-D`, from shells that do and do not hold the variables, and by ninja's own regeneration --
#      with the values every `LAUNCHER =` line of the generated build.ninja carries compared with
#      the table AND with what the configure printed, directly.
#
# The stand-in is BUILT here, from a few lines of C++, rather than being a script: the module's
# probe runs it as a program and requires `pace-cc: MISS key=` on stderr, and a shell script
# is not a program on Windows -- where this defect was measured. A toolchain that cannot build it
# is reported with `SKIP: `, never as a verdict about the module.
#
# Verdict is read from the OUTPUT, not the exit code; see src/tests/CMakeLists.txt, which
# registers this with FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION (#565).

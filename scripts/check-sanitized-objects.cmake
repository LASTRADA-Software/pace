# Objects that must carry a sanitizer's instrumentation do, and a control object that must
# not, does not.
#
# ## Why the OBJECTS, and why there is a control
#
# The vendored TUI went unsanitized in every sanitizer configuration while the configure
# printed "Enabling" and the cache read ON (#134): the flags are directory-scoped and the
# `vendor/` targets are declared before them. Nothing a configure says could have shown it,
# and neither could a binary -- the link pulls the sanitizer runtime in whole, so an
# executable carries `__asan_init` DEFINED whether or not a single object was compiled for it
# (`scripts/tsan-gate.sh` records the same trap for `__tsan_init`, #472). An object cannot
# borrow a symbol from a runtime it is not linked to, so its UNDEFINED reference to the
# runtime's init is the one reading that means instrumented.
#
# A reader asked only about objects that should be instrumented can pass by never being able
# to say "absent" -- an `nm` that printed nothing and a match that fired on anything would both
# do it. So every run also reads a CONTROL: an object compiled in the same configuration with
# `-fno-sanitize=all`, which must come back WITHOUT the reference. The two lists together
# are what make a green run mean something.
#
# ## What this does NOT claim
#
# That the instrumented code was EXERCISED, or that the sanitizer would report a defect in it:
# only that the compiler instrumented it. And UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer has no per-object
# init to read, so a UBSan-only configuration is not what this answers for.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_NM=<nm> -DPACE_SYMBOLS=<sym>[|<sym>...]
#         -DPACE_INSTRUMENTED=<obj>[|<obj>...] -DPACE_UNINSTRUMENTED=<obj>[|<obj>...]
#         -P scripts/check-sanitized-objects.cmake
#
# `|`-separated rather than CMake lists, because a `;` in a `-D` argument splits the argument.
#
# Exit: the verdict is the OUTPUT, not the status -- read through `FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`.

# `check-tidy-sweep-scope.sh`'s reader, over the shared walk. Run as:
#
#   awk -v want=<kind> [-v sweepId=<id> -v sweepJob=<job>] \
#       -f scripts/lib/workflow-walk.awk -f scripts/check-tidy-sweep-scope.awk <file> <file>
#
# The file is passed TWICE, which is the walk's convention: the pass counter comes from `FNR == 1`
# and a consumer judges on the second.
#
# ## What this replaces, and the column counts that went with it
#
# Three awk programs, each carrying `build.yml`'s indentation as literal columns -- `/^        id:/`,
# `/^        env:/`, `/^        if:/` at eight spaces, `/^          /` at ten, `/^      - /` at six,
# `/^  [A-Za-z0-9_-]+:[ \t]*$/` at two. Every one is right for the file as written today and says
# nothing about a file whose jobs sit at another depth, which is legal YAML (#1456).
#
# ## The joining, which is the part that must not regress
#
# A `run:` and an `if:` are both JOINED across their continuation lines before being tested, and
# the script records why in its own words: the shipped expression is over a hundred characters,
# wrapping it as a folded scalar is the natural response to that, and read one line at a time a
# wrapped expression looks exactly like a DELETED reader -- which is a red build accusing an author
# of something they did not do.
#
# The walk hands a `run:` body over as `WfBody[]` and every other scalar's continuations as `text`
# events carrying `WfBlockKey`, the key they belong to. That field exists for this check: without
# it a folded `if:` cannot be told from any other scalar by anything except indentation, which is
# the column counting being removed.
#
# ## The records
#
#   want=sweep   SWEEP  \t <job> \t <step id> \t <joined run> \t <joined step env>
#   want=reader  READER \t <joined if>    (only for @p sweepJob, naming @p sweepId and master)
#   want=perms   PERMS  \t <one permissions row as `scope: level`>
#   want=diff    DIFF   \t <job> \t <step id> \t <joined run> \t <joined step env>
#                (a step that runs `$TIDY_DIFF`, the clang-tidy-diff.py driver, found by what it runs)

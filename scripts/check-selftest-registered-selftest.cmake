#
# Both directions, because they are different edits with the same consequence and a check
# that only refuses is half-measured. #1031 is the scar for the accepting half: a guard
# that fails CLOSED and unconditionally reads as "my branch is bad", not as "the gate is
# broken", and can stand for days. A guard nobody has watched ACCEPT is not known to work.
#
# Each case stages a whole tiny tree -- `scripts/` plus `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` -- and
# drives the REAL check over it through `PACE_SOURCE_DIR`. A fixture reimplementing
# the classifier would be a second thing to be wrong rather than a test of this one.
#
# The verdict is read from OUTPUT, never from the exit status, and the output is FLATTENED
# first: CMake wraps `message(FATAL_ERROR)` text at about 74 columns, so a phrase that
# straddles the wrap exists in the output and in no single line of it. Measured in this
# tree: a phrase crossing column 74 matches 0 times unwrapped under FATAL_ERROR and 1 time
# after flattening. A negative case written without the flatten reports a refutation.

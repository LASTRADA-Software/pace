# Every verb `pacectl` accepts is documented, and every verb the docs claim it
# accepts exists.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# `docs/tools/pacectl.md` carries a Commands table, and nothing read it. That is
# the shape `check-resp-command-docs.sh` was written for one phase earlier, in the same
# tree, about the same kind of table: `RedisResp.hpp` had said for months that its table
# was the source of truth "if this prose drifts", and the prose drifted -- because a
# sentence is not a reader.
#
# The CLI's table is the one most likely to drift, and for a reason the RESP one does
# not share: it grows a block at a time. This check landed alongside eleven verbs added
# in one commit, which is precisely the edit where updating a doc list by hand is
# forgotten and precisely the size at which nobody notices it was.
#
# A stale list here is not cosmetic. `--help` is derived from the table, so it stays
# right; the DOC is what an operator reads before installing the thing, and a verb
# missing from it is a capability nobody knows exists. The other direction is worse: a
# documented verb that does not exist is a command somebody puts in a script.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, stated rather than left to be discovered
#
#   * Operand counts, modifiers and summaries. `--help` derives those from the row and
#     is the reference; the doc's job is to say a verb EXISTS and what family it is in.
#   * The prose outside the Commands table. `### The memcached-only verbs` explains
#     several verbs in bullets, and a scan over prose could only compare spellings
#     inside sentences -- a sentence is not a list.
#   * Which block a verb is filed under. Putting `touch` in the Read row would pass.
#     That is a judgement about a category, not a false statement about what the tool
#     accepts.
#
# ## Constraints
#
# bash 3.2 (macOS ships a 2007 `/bin/bash` and this runs in the default ctest set): no
# `mapfile`, `declare -A`, `${var^^}` or `local -n`. `fail` is unconditional rather than
# guarded on `BASHPID`, which is bash 4.0+.

# Refuses when a file or line count `vendor/VENDOR.md` states about a vendored copy is not what the
# tree holds (#1376).
#
# VENDOR.md states each copy's size, and a size maintained by hand beside a hand-maintained file set
# drifts: `ac102948` corrected a line count after a local change added a test file and the sentence
# did not move. So the figures are recomputed here from the tree, and a stated figure that differs is
# refused naming both numbers.
#
# VENDOR.md's "The copies" table carries one row per root of `scripts/lib/third-party-roots.txt` --
# the root in backticks, its upstream, its files, its lines -- and each row is recomputed here from
# that root's files; lines are newline characters, as `wc -l` counts them. The roots are READ, never
# restated (#178 added `vendor/monocypher`; #1596 removed `vendor/endo`, whose structural figures --
# the supporting files beside `tui`, how many were headers -- this check also read while it was
# here): a root with no row is refused, since a copy VENDOR.md does not describe is one nobody checks
# the size of, and so is a row naming a directory the roots file does not.
#
# Every figure phrase must be FOUND. A row this check cannot find is a refusal, never a pass: a
# reworded table would otherwise leave the check comparing nothing and agreeing perfectly. The prose
# is read with its line breaks folded to spaces, because markdown wraps a sentence wherever the
# editor did.
#
# NOT covered, stated so it is not over-read: figures VENDOR.md quotes as MEASUREMENTS at a moment
# (the formatter's "146 of 165" on its first run) describe the world when they were taken and are
# deliberately left pinned rather than recomputed.
#
# Usage:

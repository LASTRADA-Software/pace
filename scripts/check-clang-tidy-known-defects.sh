# A defect the declared clang-tidy build is KNOWN to have is asserted against that build, never remembered.
#
# ## Why
#
# The analyser `.clang-tidy-version` declares crashes on some source shapes. The tree rewrites every site of such a
# shape rather than disable the check (#1404): a crash fails the build closed, and a disabled check is NOLINT by other
# means. But a rewrite with no reason beside it reads as an accident to the next cleanup, and nothing would say when it
# may come out. So each defect is a ROW below, carrying the check it lives in, the issue that documents it, and three
# units planted and run through the declared build:
#
#   crashes   the shape itself, which the build must STILL crash on: exit 139 and a stack dump. Measured on the Linux
#             wheel and on the Windows wheels under Git Bash, which reports the access violation as 139 too.
#   named     the same computation with the offending call named first, which must analyse cleanly -- so the unit
#             parses on this host, and a crash in `crashes` belongs to the shape rather than to a header search.
#   live      a shape the check reports, which it must report -- so the check is enabled and running in this build,
#             and `crashes` not crashing can mean only that the defect is gone.
#
# When the pin moves to an LLVM carrying the upstream fix, `crashes` stops crashing and `--installed` goes red ON THE
# CHANGE THAT MOVED THE PIN, naming what that change removes: the row, and the comment naming its issue at each site,
# which it lists. The rewrites themselves may stay.
#
# **So a row is its own record, and needs no open issue.** The event a known defect waits for is the pin moving, and
# the row is what fires on it; an issue held open for the same event would be a second copy of the tripwire, and the
# one nothing wires. The issue a row names is where the defect is DOCUMENTED, open or closed (#1410). For the same
# reason a table with NO rows is legal in every mode: the change that retires the last defect deletes the last row,
# and the guard it leaves behind must still pass.
#
# ## Modes
#
#   (default)           Every row is well formed, and every source line under `src/` that names a row's check also
#                       names that row's issue -- a site comment is one line for exactly that reason. Needs no
#                       analyser, runs in the default ctest set.
#   --installed <exe>   Run every row's three units through <exe> and require the outcomes above. Run by both
#                       clang-tidy jobs after they identify the install, and by local-gate.sh after it resolves the
#                       analyser. Not a ctest: no build leg has the analyser, so it would skip everywhere (#1135).
#   --self-test         Drive the decision over every outcome, and both other modes end to end over COPIES of this
#                       script carrying a sample table -- one row, a malformed row, and none -- so no case depends on
#                       what the shipped table holds. The shipped tree is checked last, against the shipped table.
#
# bash 3.2: the default and self-test modes run in ctest on macOS. There, `"${Rows[@]}"` on an EMPTY array is an
# unbound variable under `set -u` -- measured on 3.2.57, and fixed only in bash 4.4 -- so every walk of the table is
# `${Rows[@]+"${Rows[@]}"}`. `${#Rows[@]}` is safe on 3.2 and is used as it is.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-clang-tidy-known-defects.sh [<source-dir>]
#   bash scripts/check-clang-tidy-known-defects.sh --installed <exe> [<source-dir>]
#   bash scripts/check-clang-tidy-known-defects.sh --self-test [<source-dir>]

UsageError=2

# The analyser was found and CANNOT ANSWER (#1574) -- its own build is unusable here, so no row's outcome is a
# statement about the tree or about the defect the row names.
#
# Its own status, and not a `FAIL` sharing 1 with "a row changed status", because those are opposite diagnoses sent
# to opposite people. Measured on this repository's Windows host: the PyPI clang-tidy wheel `--resolve` finds under
# Git Bash ships no C++ standard library, so every row's live unit failed on `#include <algorithm>` and this script
# refused with *"modernize-min-max-use-initializer-list did not report the live unit ... whether the crashing shape
# still crashes says nothing"* -- a confident, specific claim about #1410's status, from a run that had learned
# nothing about it. The same script, same arguments, under WSL exits 0.
#
# 77, the number this tree already spells "the prerequisite was not there", so a consumer that wants to skip can and
# one that wants to refuse can say WHY. `local-gate.sh` refuses, naming the analyser build rather than the tree.

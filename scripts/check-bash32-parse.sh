# Can the bash we ship to actually PARSE these scripts? (#1100)
#
# A script here can be legal token by token, pass every guard the repository has, pass
# the local gate, and still be unparseable by the bash macOS ships. Nothing ran a parse
# check, so the only instrument that reported it was the full `ctest` run inside
# `macOS-clang-release`, four minutes into a required context -- and it reported it at
# the WRONG LINE.
#
# ## The instance, and why no existing guard could see it
#
# PR #1096, run 34318804605. One test of 3533 failed:
#
#     3447/3533 Test #3450: e2e-helpers-selftest ...***Failed    0.02 sec
#     .../check-e2e-helpers.sh: line 402: syntax error near unexpected token `('
#
# `0.02 sec` -- it never ran, it died at parse. And line 402 was NOT the cause: that
# construct is on master unchanged and parses fine. bash 3.2 reads an apostrophe inside
# a COMMENT within `$( )` as opening a single-quoted string, so an ODD number of them
# desynchronises the scan, it swallows the closing paren, and the parser reports failure
# at the first real paren it meets -- 135 lines further down.
#
# The bash-3.2 TOKEN scan in `check-e2e-helpers.sh` could not see it and was right not
# to: `mapfile`, `declare -A`, `local -n` are all absent, every token is legal on 3.2,
# and the defect is a COMPOSITION of legal ones. That gap is #880. This is its
# complement, not its replacement -- a construct that PARSES on 3.2 and behaves
# differently (`BASHPID` silently empty) is invisible here and stays the token scan's
# job. Neither subsumes the other.
#
# ## Why this refuses on a modern bash instead of passing
#
# Run under bash 5, `bash -n` parses the very constructs this exists to catch and reports
# success -- the guard passing because it is testing something else, which this tree has
# already paid for once in `check-catch-skip-return-code`. So the interpreter is ASSERTED,
# and a bash 4.0 or newer is a REFUSAL rather than a green.
#
# That makes this a macOS-job step rather than a ctest registration: the only real 3.2 in
# this project's world is a macOS runner. `--self-test` runs anywhere, because it drives
# the checker's own logic rather than the parser's.
#
# bash 3.2: this runs under the 2007 interpreter by design.

# The compile worker's shipped reference configuration must name every setting a
# configuration file can carry, and no setting it cannot.
#
# `NodeOptions()` is the single source of truth for what the file accepts -- the
# `yamlKey` column drives the parse -- and `packaging/config/pace-node.yaml`
# is what an operator actually reads. Nothing links the two. A flag added with a
# key and no line in the reference is a setting that works and that nobody can
# find; a line in the reference for a key the table dropped is worse, because an
# operator writes it, restarts, and the worker refuses to start naming a key it
# has never heard of.
#
# Neither direction shows up in any build or test: the flag parses, the file
# parses, and the two simply describe different products. So the check is a
# string comparison over the two files, which is what makes `cmake -P` the right
# tool -- see check-repository-hygiene.cmake for the longer argument. It needs no
# compiler, no daemon and no socket, and belongs in the default `ctest` set.
#
# ## What this check does NOT see: the VALUE a key ships with
#
# It compares key NAMES. A line's value shape is invisible to it, and for one kind
# of setting that is a real gap rather than a boundary: a BOOLEAN shipped as a bare
# `#key:` is a trap, because "uncomment to enable" is the natural reading and
# uncommenting alone yields `TypeMismatch: setting names no value` and a worker that
# refuses to start. Booleans therefore ship as `#key: false`, like their six
# siblings in the reference file -- and #485 shipped one that did not, which this
# check passed.
#
# The same bare shape is CORRECT for a value-taking setting (`#scheduler:`,
# `#log_level:`): uncommenting alone fails loudly and self-explanatorily, and the
# operator was always going to supply the value the prose above it describes. So
# this is not a rule that could simply be extended to every key, which is why it is
# recorded here for the next person adding a setting rather than encoded.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-node-config-reference.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = the two agree. 1 = at least one key is in one and not the other.

# A `cmake -P` script has no project, so every policy starts unset and CMP0057
# (`if(... IN_LIST ...)`) is one of them -- unset, the operator is an unknown
# argument and the script errors out rather than answering. Stated as a minimum
# version so the whole set moves together with the project's own.

# A key the reference is claimed to document is a line that would BECOME a

# is not a documented setting and must not count as one, or the check passes on a
# file whose header happens to name everything.
# Read whole and split by hand, never `file(STRINGS)`: that call returns a CMake
# LIST, and an UNBALANCED `[` or `]` on a KEPT line merges that element with the
# ones after it, so everything past the bracket vanishes from the scan. It takes
# a PATH, so there is nothing to neutralise beforehand.
#
# Blanking the brackets is safe HERE and is not safe everywhere: this reader
# matches `^#([a-z_]+):`, a commented YAML key, which contains none. Where brackets are the data --
# `check-tsan-scope`, whose rows are Catch2 tags like `[async]` -- the remedy is
# a list-free offset walk instead, and blanking them makes that check refuse on a
# good tree. Measured, in this branch.

# Fifth-and-counting copy of this idiom; consolidating them is
# [#495](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/495) and is

# MEASURED: injecting one `]` into a comment in the reference YAML took this
# check from a clean pass to a hard refusal -- "read 36 keys from the table
# and 0 from the reference; one of the two scans matched nothing, so this
# check proved nothing rather than passing". That is the vacuous-pass guard
# working, and it stays: the fix makes the refusal rare, not absent.

# A unit that runs a COMPILER names a working directory, and names one it creates.
#
# systemd starts a service in `/` when the unit gives it no `WorkingDirectory=`.
# For a daemon that executes nothing that is merely untidy. For the compile worker
# it is a wrong object under a right key:
#
#   A dispatched compile carries the client's compilation directory and the
#   replacement to record for it. The worker spells that as
#   `-fdebug-prefix-map=<directory>=<replacement>` for the client's directory AND
#   for its own, because gcc records the client's and clang records the worker's.
#   A prefix-map rule appends the unmatched tail, so `<from>` = `/` matches every
#   absolute path in the object and keeps the rest: `/usr/include/stdio.h` becomes
#   `.usr/include/stdio.h`. Measured on gcc 14.2.0 against a node running in `/`,
#   `DW_AT_comp_dir` came back `.tmp/.../client` and every system header read
#   `.usr/include/...`.
#
# `WorkerPrefixMapRules` drops the worker's own rule when the worker's directory
# contains the client's, which is what stops a node installed from an older package
# producing that object -- at the cost of leaving clang's `DW_AT_comp_dir` naming
# this machine. The `WorkingDirectory=` is what buys that back. Issue #674.
#
# WHY A SCAN AND NOT A TEST THAT RUNS THE UNIT
#
# Nothing else can see this. Running the real unit needs root and a live systemd,
# so it is reachable only from the packaging job -- which runs twenty minutes in,
# is not a required context, and therefore reports to nobody (#684). And no
# end-to-end fixture can substitute: every one of them starts the node from the
# fixture's own working directory, which is exactly why #674 reached master with a
# dedicated dispatch e2e already green. A `cmake -P` scan of the shipped file is
# the only instrument that fails on the same commit that introduces the defect.
#
# WHAT IT REFUSES, AND WHY EACH ONE IS A REAL WAY TO GET THIS WRONG
#
#   no directive               the defect itself: systemd starts the service in `/`
#   only in a comment          a `#`-prefixed line documents an intention and
#                              configures nothing; a check that matched anywhere on
#                              the line would pass the file that caused #674 the
#                              moment somebody wrote a paragraph about it
#   `WorkingDirectory=`        an empty assignment RESETS the setting to its default
#                              in systemd, so a second, later, empty one silently
#                              undoes the first
#   `/`                        the value the defect produces, spelled out
#   `-/some/path`              the `-` prefix means "start anyway if the chdir
#                              fails", and starting anyway means starting in `/`
#   `~`                        the service account's home, which sysusers gives as
#                              `/` -- the bug by another spelling
#   a path nothing creates     the service then fails to start at every boot, which
#                              is a worse outcome than the one being fixed
#
# The last one is why this check reads `RuntimeDirectory=` and `StateDirectory=`
# rather than only looking for a directive: under the `ProtectSystem=strict` these
# units set, a directory the unit does not declare is read-only at best and absent
# at worst, and "add a WorkingDirectory=" is a one-line change that takes the
# service down if the path is wrong.
#
# AND THE STATE DIRECTORY A NODE'S IDENTITY LIVES IN
#
# A second question about the same units, asked here because it reads the same
# directives with the same parser. The compile node keeps its identity key in a state
# directory, and when no `--cluster-dir` names one it takes the platform's default --
# machine-wide for a PRIVILEGED process, the account's own otherwise. The packaged unit
# runs as `User=fastcache-node`, which is not privileged and whose home sysusers gives
# as `/`, so left to itself the machine's service would keep its identity under
# `/.local/state`, which `ProtectSystem=strict` leaves read-only. What makes it the
# machine's directory is `StateDirectory=<name>`: systemd creates it and hands the
# service `STATE_DIRECTORY`, which the node takes -- but only an entry named what
# `NodeStateDirectoryName` says, read out of the source rather than restated here, so a
# rename on either side is refused rather than silently handing over a directory the
# node ignores.
#
#   no StateDirectory=         the service keeps its identity in its account's home
#   a different name           systemd hands one over and the node declines it
#   a later empty assignment   RESETS the list, so nothing is handed over
#
# AND THE DIRECTORY A NODE'S DISK TIER LIVES IN
#
# A third question about the same unit, and the one an operator meets first. `cache_dir`
# has no default -- a disk tier is a resource an operator names -- so the unit cannot
# turn one on. What it owes is somewhere the operator CAN point it, and under
# `ProtectSystem=strict` that is a directory the unit declares. The state directory it
# already declares is not one: the node keeps its identity there and refuses to start
# beside an entry it has no row for ("this build keeps no entry by that name"). The unit
# shipped without a `CacheDirectory=` while the docs told operators to write
# `cache_dir: /var/cache/fastcache-node`, a path the service could not write -- so the
# packaged disk tier was reachable only through a drop-in, and the obvious workaround,
# a directory inside the state directory, stopped the node.
#
# So the unit's `CacheDirectory=` is read, and every `cache_dir` the docs and the shipped
# reference configuration CITE is judged against it: the path an operator is told to
# write must be one the service can write.
#
#   no CacheDirectory=         nothing persistent is writable but the state directory
#   a later empty assignment   RESETS the list, so nothing is created
#   a cited path it does not   the operator follows the docs and the node either cannot
#   create                     open the store or refuses to start
#   no citation in the         zero citations is no verdict, and the file an operator
#   reference configuration    edits is the one that must say where
#
# Blind spot, failing OPEN: only a cited path under /var/ is judged. A page citing
# `/srv/fc` for the packaged service passes, because the same text is right for a node
# started by hand and nothing in it says which one the page means. /var/ is where a
# system service keeps what it writes, so that is where a citation for one is read.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`, for the reasons check-repository-hygiene.cmake states at
# length: it compares strings and reports, so a .sh + .ps1 pair would be two
# implementations of one rule differing only in syntax, and cmake is the one tool
# guaranteed present. See check-script-check-signals.cmake for why the verdict is
# read from this script's OUTPUT rather than from its exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-node-working-directory.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

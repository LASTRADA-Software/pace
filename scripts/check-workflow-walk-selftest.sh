# `scripts/lib/workflow-walk.awk`, driven directly (#1456).
#
# ## Why a self-test of its own, and not the consumers'
#
# The library is to serve five checks, and the first of them --
# `check-workflow-step-env.sh` -- uses three of its eight event kinds. The other
# five are reached by nothing in this tree yet, and gawk's rule about calling an
# undefined function is **per reached path, not per program**: a hook a consumer
# never reaches exits 0 in silence, and is then a fatal error on somebody's
# unrelated pull request. The same asymmetry runs the other way for the library
# itself -- a kind nothing drives is a kind nothing has watched work, and it
# reads as covered because the consumer's own self-test is green.
#
# So every kind is driven HERE, and the run says how many of each. WfPath, the
# job record and the key event have no consumer until the second migration; they
# are tested from the day they ship or they ship untested.
#
# ## What the cases are for
#
# The ones the ticket asks for are where the five private readers each failed
# differently: block scalars with chomping indicators, a heredoc whose body
# contains a step, a flow mapping, an alias, a quoted key and a second document.
# To those this adds the records nothing else reads yet, and the two defects that
# reading a transcript of a rich case found -- a job flushed only after the NEXT
# job's key event, and a pass whose last job was never flushed at all.
#
# And a job MATRIX (#1432), whose fixture opens with GitHub's own documented
# include example -- the one expected answer here not written by whoever wrote
# the model -- then #1432's arm64 row, an include-only matrix, exclude followed by
# an include adding back, a matrix written below its steps, and one job per way
# the walk must REFUSE a matrix rather than guess its legs.
#
# ## Proving it can fail
#
# Every assertion family has a NEUTER: the library is copied with one line
# disabled and the same assertions are required to go red. A neuter that provokes
# nothing is reported as its own failure, because that means either the line is
# not load-bearing or no assertion reaches it. A green self-test over an
# unneutered library says only that today's fixtures and today's code agree.
#
# ## What it costs, and why the TIMEOUT did not move
#
# Neuters multiply the assertions: each one re-runs its case's whole list. While
# every assertion was a `grep`, the cost was PROCESS SPAWNS, which Windows charges
# for heavily and an x64-emulated `windows-11-arm` more heavily still. Measured,
# with the pins these figures describe (they are conditions, not live values):
#
#   ctest seconds, per leg       master ee71f868    #1541, 336dffcd    #1543
#                                run 35338027883    run 35338751765    run 35340951724
#   assertions / neuters            41 / 13            78 / 29            78 / 29
#   Windows-cl-release                  11.35            39.65            30.23
#   Windows-clangcl-release             16.60            34.17            35.82
#   Windows-cl-debug                     7.73            46.91              --
#   Windows-cl-release-arm64              --               --          Timeout 60.03
#   Linux-gcc-release                    0.68             2.35             2.23
#   macOS-clang-release                  1.62             5.86             5.22
#
# So #1541 took the x64 Windows legs to 30-47 s of a 60 s budget -- `cl-debug` at
# 78% -- and arm64 over it. The spawns were counted with PATH shims on a Windows
# 11 x64 host under Git Bash: 986 per run, 889 of them `grep`. Assertions now
# match the transcript in the shell, read once per drive, which left 97 spawns
# (33 `awk` drives, 29 `sed` + 29 `cmp` for the neuters, 5 `cat`, 1 `mktemp`), and
# took the same host from 16.99 s to 4.97 s, idle, with every neuter provoking the
# same number of failures as before.
#
# `TIMEOUT 60` stays. A timeout on a degraded runner is not a verdict about the
# tree (#1515), and raising it would have hidden a cost that grows with every
# neuter added here; the fix was the cost. A neuter is still one `sed`, one
# `cmp` and one `awk`, so a large new batch of them is the thing to measure on a
# Windows leg before it lands.

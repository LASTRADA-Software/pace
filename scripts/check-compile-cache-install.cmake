# Assert that cmake/portable/CompileCache.cmake can actually install a launcher
# other half of check-compile-cache-autoinstall.cmake, which only proves it
# declines gracefully. A module that declined every time would pass that one
# perfectly.
#
# It runs offline, against a release mirror this script builds in a temporary
# directory and serves over file://. That is not a contrivance for the test's
# sake: FASTCACHE_AUTO_INSTALL_DOWNLOAD_BASE exists so an organisation can
# install from its own mirror, and pointing it at a local tree is exactly what
# such a site does. Doing it this way keeps the check deterministic and free of
# GitHub's 60-requests-per-hour limit, which a CI fleet behind one egress
# address would otherwise share out among its jobs — and a check that skips
# because it was rate-limited verifies nothing.
#
# What it covers that the decline paths cannot: composing the asset name,
# finding the launcher at the per-platform path inside the archive, unpacking,
# marking it executable, moving it into the shared staging directory under the
# right version and platform, running it, and handing it to the selection logic.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<repo> -DFASTCACHED_SCRATCH_DIR=<scratch>
#         -DFASTCACHED_CXX_COMPILER=<c++> [-DFASTCACHED_MAKE_PROGRAM=<make>]
#         [-DFASTCACHED_GENERATOR=<gen>]
#         -P scripts/check-compile-cache-install.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = installed as specified, or skipped. 1 = it did not.

# `istreambuf-iterator` must be SEEN to refuse a use, and seen to stay QUIET over the
# prose that documents the rule.
#
# Both arms, or the check is only half-tested -- and the QUIET arm is the one that
# decides whether a check survives. Seven of this tree's eight occurrences are
# comments, including the doc comment on the helper header that exists to be the one
# spelling. A check that refused those would refuse the documentation of its own rule,
# with no escape hatch but rewording the comment, and it would be deleted rather than
# obeyed.
#
# ## The mode is part of the output, and asserted on both sides
#
# This fixture stages synthetic trees, and a synthetic tree is not a git repository.
# So every case would exercise the DIRECTORY WALK while CI exercises GIT -- which is
# exactly how `check-catch-skip-return-code` came to have six green self-test cases
# and a red CI run with no contradiction between them: the mode under test was not
# the mode in use.
#
# So the check names its mode in its output, cases assert it, and the git path is
# staged for real with `git init` plus `git add` -- an index is all `git ls-files`
# needs, so no commit and no identity are required.
#
# ## Line numbers are asserted, not just filenames
#
# `;`, `\`, `[` and `]` are all CMake list structure and C++ is full of all four. Get
# the reading wrong and lines merge: the following line is hidden and every line number
# below it drifts. One case therefore plants all four ABOVE a violation and asserts the
# exact `file:line`, because an assertion on the FILENAME alone passes under the bug.
#
# That case earned its keep immediately. The check first used the house
# `fastcached_read_lines` splitting idiom, and this case failed: a line ending in a
# backslash merges with the next one there -- measured, 4 list elements where 5 are
# right -- which is the one thing that reader's own comment claims it prevents. Because
# the merged element began with `//`, the comment stripper then ate the real code, so
# the use was reported NOWHERE. A false green. The check is list-free now.
#
# The mutations are applied to a SYNTHESISED tree, never to the tree under test, so
# there is no revert step and nothing can be left behind. Each case asserts its
# mutation actually LANDED before any verdict is drawn from it.
#
# The BASELINE is load-bearing: every refusal below is evidence only if the unmutated
# tree passes, or each case is merely observing the same pre-existing failure.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check
# reports failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# A `directory walk` expectation below names the mode CLASS and not which of its two reasons
# ran. Since #1485 a walk says whether there was no index at all or whether the index named no
# matching file, and which one a staged tree gets depends on where the scratch directory sits --
# a tree with no `.git` of its own is still inside a work tree whenever `CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`
# is. The git-against-walk distinction these cases exist for is unaffected; the two reasons are
# pinned in `check-tracked-files-selftest.cmake`, which controls the git probe instead of
# inheriting it.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DFASTCACHED_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-istreambuf-iterator-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

# Every `catch_discover_tests` registration tells ctest that exit 4 means SKIPPED.
#
# ## What this check enforces is exact under the pinned Catch2 -- and was not before (#1128)
#
# `SKIP_RETURN_CODE 4` closed #499's false RED and, on Catch2 3.6.0, opened a false
# GREEN: Catch2's exit code was then its failed-assertion count, so a case failing
# exactly four assertions was scored *skipped*, and so was a case that skipped one
# `SECTION` and failed four assertions in another -- measured through real ctest, inside
# `100% tests passed`, in all five binaries.
#
# Catch2 3.7.1 standardised its exit codes: every case skipped exits 4, ANY assertion
# failure exits 42 whatever the count. Under that contract this property is exact, and
# the top-level CMakeLists pins Catch2 EXACTLY so a machine's older 3.x cannot bring the
# collision back. This check says every registration carries the property; whether the
# property still MEANS what it says is `catch-skip-exit-contract`'s question, which runs
# the shapes against the linked Catch2. The argument, with the 3.6.0 measurements of the
# output and composition channels, is at the top-level CMakeLists and in
# `.agent/rules/testing.md`.
#
# A Catch2 case that calls `SKIP(...)` exits **4**. `SKIP_RETURN_CODE` is the only
# thing that tells ctest an exit code means *skipped* rather than *failed*, and none
# of the five Catch2 registrations set it -- so the binary printed `1 skipped` and
# ctest printed `***Failed` for the very same run
# ([#499](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/499)). Measured on
# one forced skip:
#
#     CowTreeTests "[skiprepro]"   ->  test cases: 1 | 1 skipped   BINARY EXIT: 4
#     ctest -R "..."               ->  ***Failed
#     after SKIP_RETURN_CODE 4     ->  ***Skipped
#
# ## Why this is a check and not just a comment
#
# **Skipped, absent, unstarted and failed are four states**, and a registration that
# omits this property collapses two of them at the reporting layer. It is a false RED,
# which is the insidious direction: the seven `SKIP` sites in this tree are all
# environment-conditional -- three on `AvailableCodecs().size() < 2`, four on being
# able to bind loopback -- so they fire on a constrained runner or a build configured
# without codecs and report a regression that is not there. Nobody had hit it because
# those conditions had not arisen on CI, which is luck rather than coverage.
#
# It also makes `SKIP` unusable as a tool. Whoever adds one, watches the suite go red
# and concludes the skip is wrong will delete the skip rather than suspect the
# registration -- the wrong lesson, learned permanently.
#
# The repository already knew the mechanism: eleven script-driven `add_test`
# registrations in `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` set `SKIP_RETURN_CODE 77`, one directory
# away from five Catch2 registrations that set nothing. So a comment is not what was
# missing. **A sixth test binary would reopen this by omission exactly as the fifth
# did**, which is the door this closes -- the same argument as
# `check-script-check-signals.cmake`, and the set of registrations is READ from the
# tree rather than restated here, for the same reason.
#
# ## The value is checked, not just the property
#
# `77` is the GNU convention the script-driven tests use because a shell script
# chooses its own exit code. A Catch2 binary does not: Catch2 exits **4** on skip, and
# nothing else. A registration carrying `SKIP_RETURN_CODE 77` would look correct in a
# diff, satisfy any "is the property present" scan, and still score every skip as a
# failure -- so the number is part of the rule.
#
# ## A caution for whoever changes a registration
#
# `catch_discover_tests` writes its test list in a **POST_BUILD** step, so editing the
# CMakeLists and reconfiguring is not enough: the old list survives a full successful
# `cmake --preset`, and the stale result reads exactly like a current one. Measured --
# after the edit and a clean reconfigure the case still reported `***Failed`, and only
# a REBUILD turned it into `***Skipped`. If you are verifying this property by hand,
# rebuild the test target first or you will be reading yesterday's answer.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`: it reads files, compares strings and reports. See
# `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports failure through its
# OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-catch-skip-return-code.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

# A `cmake -P` script has no project, so every policy starts unset and CMP0057
# (`if(... IN_LIST ...)`) is one of them -- unset, the operator is an unknown argument
# and the script errors out rather than answering, on the CMake version this project
# declares. Stated as a minimum version so the whole set moves together.

# Read and split by hand rather than with `file(STRINGS)`, which returns a LIST: a
# line containing a semicolon becomes two elements and every line number after it
# drifts. Backslashes are escaped first, or a line ending in one merges with the next
# and every reported line number after it is wrong.
#
# A semicolon is only HALF of CMake's list grouping, and this check carried the other
# half open until #495. `[` and `]` are structure too, so ONE unbalanced bracket -- in
# a COMMENT, where nobody is thinking about CMake syntax -- merges every following line
# into a single element.
#
# Measured here: a single `]` inserted into a comment near the top of
# `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` took this check from 5 registrations to 4, and it PASSED
# both times. It counts registrations and asserts each can report skips, so a smaller
# set still passes unanimously -- no verdict can show it, and no emptiness guard can
# either, because 4 is not 0. The count is the only thing that moves.
#
# Brackets are REPLACED rather than escaped because nothing here matches on them, and a
# space preserves every column and every line number.
#
# Escaping `;` and `\` used to be kept here on the grounds that this check reports
# `file:line` and its lines must survive verbatim. They did not survive verbatim, and a
# line ending in a backslash did not survive at all: no CMake list can carry one.
# Measured on CMake 3.28.3, `one\\;two` -- an ESCAPED backslash followed by a separator --
# expands to ONE element, because a `;` preceded by any backslash is read as escaped
# whether or not that backslash was itself escaped. The merged element begins with the
# EARLIER line, so a `#` comment swallowed the real line below it and every `file:line`
# after it drifted, which is a false GREEN.
#
# So the lines are WALKED and no list is built. Live exposure was ZERO when this was
# repaired -- no file in this check's corpus of 12 CMakeLists ends a line with a
# backslash -- which makes it a latent hazard closed rather than an observed failure
# fixed. The hazard is one file away: `dist-compile-e2e.sh` has 152 such lines.
#
# #495 records why this idiom exists in two copies; consolidating them is that ticket
# and not this one.

# This is the third time the same defect bit this check, and the first two fixes were
# both the wrong shape. The scan must not see vendored third-party code -- nobody here
# can edit it, and Catch2 ships a bare `catch_discover_tests` of its own. The first
# version globbed from the source root and reported `_deps/catch2-src`. The second
# excluded a LIST of directory names -- `out`, `build`, `_deps` -- and CI then found
# the same Catch2 tree at `.cache/CPM/catch2/<hash>/tests/...`, because CPM resolves
# dependencies inside the source tree under a name that list did not have.
#
# A list of names to exclude is a hand-kept list, which is the exact thing this
# check's own ticket exists to retire. So stop enumerating: `git ls-files` answers
# "what does this repository contain" directly, and a dependency cache is untracked by
# construction whatever it is called and wherever a package manager decides to put it.
# It is also fast -- no stat of a build tree at all. The walk fallback still carries
# the excluded names, in the shared enumeration where there is one copy of them rather
# than the seven this check's own history argues against.

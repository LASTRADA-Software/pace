# Socket-activate the compile node for real, on this machine, in seconds.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# #770 took both packaging jobs red on master: #754's advertise rule compared the
# advertised port against `--listen-node`, and under socket activation the UNIT owns
# the address, so that flag holds a default (6674) which is not the port the worker
# serves. The packaged worker exited 2, the socket accepted the activating connection,
# and nothing came up.
#
# **The gap was not that activation is untested. It is that the two things which ARE
# tested cannot fail in the same way.** `ParseSocketActivation` is unit-tested and
# passes under that bug -- it parses `LISTEN_FDS` correctly and knows nothing about
# startup policy. The packaging job that did catch it runs twenty minutes in, on a
# GitHub runner, and is **not a required context** -- so the failure reached master
# through a door that reports to nobody (#684). Between a parser unit test and a
# packaging job there was nothing at all, and that is the space this fills.
#
# ## What it proves that neither of those can
#
#   1. The worker COMES UP under activation      -- the assertion #770 failed. Under
#                                                   #754's shipped rule this fixture
#                                                   goes red in seconds with the exact
#                                                   error CI reported; it was run that
#                                                   way before being committed, because
#                                                   a guard nobody has watched refuse is
#                                                   not a guard.
#   2. Activation is REAL, not a plain spawn     -- nothing runs until a connection
#                                                   arrives. Without this the fixture
#                                                   would pass against a node that
#                                                   ignored the handover entirely.
#   3. The socket is ADOPTED, not re-bound       -- the node says so, AND the default
#                                                   port it would otherwise have taken
#                                                   did not become occupied. The log
#                                                   line alone is a claim. Sampled
#                                                   before and after, because a bare
#                                                   reading fails on any machine already
#                                                   running a daemon on 6674 -- which
#                                                   this project's own dogfood host is.
#   4. It advertises the ACTIVATED port          -- the half #770 was about: the port
#                                                   clients are sent to is the one the
#                                                   supervisor opened.
#
# `--derive-advertise` runs it with NO `--advertise` at all: the node reads the address
# and port off the socket it is handed (`Node::AdoptActivatedBind`) and must advertise
# them -- the stock package, which once refused to start without that flag.
#
# ## The configurations are the packaged ones
#
# The default mode's is `advertise:` and no `listen_node:` -- byte-for-byte the shape
# `.github/workflows/build.yml`'s packaging job writes into the file the unit's ExecStart
# names. Taken from the workflow rather than from a shape that seemed representative,
# because #770 is precisely a configuration nobody thought to write down. The shipped
# `pace-node.yaml` carries no `advertise:` any more, so `--derive-advertise`
# is the configuration a stock package installs.
#
# Registered in `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` rather than beside the node, for the reason
# `fleet-dashboard-e2e` states: a script-driven test naming an executable belongs where
# every target already exists.

# What stood here said the node walks the include tree before reporting ready. It
# does not, and has not since #365 moved the walk onto the heartbeat thread's
# first round. `compile node ready` is `ReadinessFact::Serving` in
# `Core/ReadinessMarker.hpp`: the 0xFC surface accepting and the heartbeat thread
# running -- later than the bind, later than the accept start, and EARLIER than
# the toolchain survey. Read that row rather than a paraphrase of it; the whole
# reason `fact` and `meaning` are columns is that this line has been re-meant once
# already while every fixture went on matching the string.
#
# Not "bound" either. That is the word two rulebook files reached for and the one
# that row exists to correct -- the fact is strictly stronger than a bind and
# strictly weaker than a survey.
#
# So the budget protects nothing this fixture asserts. Its three assertions are
# socket adoption, the default 6674 staying free and the advertised port, none of
# which need a completed survey, and there is no `wait_for_registration` and no
# toolchain marker anywhere in this file. The number is left at 240 anyway:
# nobody has watched this wait expire, and tightening a bound on reasoning alone
# is the same move #354 refuses in the other direction.
#
# And it no longer offers itself as corroboration for `fleet-dashboard-e2e`'s
# bound. That was the expensive half of the stale reason rather than the seconds:
# a second fixture's budget could be argued from this comment, which reads as two
# independent sources agreeing when it is one dead fact quoted twice.

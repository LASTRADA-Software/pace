# The launcher's documented environment table must name every variable the launcher
# reads, and no variable it does not.
#
# `EnvName` in `src/apps/pace-cc/LauncherCli.hpp` holds the names, and
# `EnvironmentTable` in `LauncherCli.cpp` is what drives parsing and `--help` from
# them. `docs/tools/pace-cc.md` is what somebody reading the documentation site
# gets instead. Nothing linked the two, and the page said so in prose:
#
#   > `pace-cc --help` documents the same set, generated from the table in
#   > `LauncherCli.cpp` ... if the two ever disagree, `--help` is right.
#
# A sentence that names a hazard and does nothing about it. A variable added to the
# table and never written into the page is undocumented for every reader who is not
# at a terminal, with a fully green suite; a row on the page for a name the launcher
# no longer reads is worse, because it is advice that silently does nothing.
#
# The daemon has had exactly this check since `check-node-config-reference.cmake`,
# whose argument for `cmake -P` applies here unchanged: it is a string comparison
# over two files, needs no compiler, daemon or socket, and belongs in the default
# `ctest` set. This is #881, and #700 is why it exists -- adding one variable meant
# writing it into three unconnected places.
#
# ## Why this reader does not use `file(STRINGS)`
#
# The page is markdown and every other line carries a `[link](target)`. `file(STRINGS)`
# yields a CMake LIST, and a `]` in an element merges it with its neighbour -- the
# hazard `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` records per (reader, file, surviving
# lines), where two of six readers failed SILENTLY. Blanking the brackets is wrong
# here for the same reason it was wrong for `check-tsan-scope`: they are the data.
#
# So the whole file is read as one string and only the NAMES are matched out of it.
# Every captured substring is `FASTCACHE_[A-Z_]+`, which cannot contain a bracket, so
# there is no element for a stray `]` to merge with. Immune by construction rather
# than by the corpus happening to be safe today.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-launcher-env-reference.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = the two agree. 1 = a name is in one and not the other, or either
# scan matched nothing.

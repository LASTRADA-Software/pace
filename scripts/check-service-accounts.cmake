# Service accounts: one spelling, one creator, one remover.
#
# A service that names an account its platform cannot resolve does not fail
# loudly. On launchd the plist is accepted, `launchctl bootstrap` and `kickstart`
# both return 0, and only the spawn never happens -- which is why
# ServiceControl.cpp refuses at install time instead. That refusal is only as good
# as the agreement between three places that never see each other:
#
#   * the C++ that hands the name to the supervisor,
#   * the packaging that CREATES the account, and
#   * the uninstaller that REMOVES it again.
#
# Each of those has already been the odd one out. Issue #87 is the missing
# creator: `fastcache-compile-node` named `fastcache-node` and the macOS package
# created only `_fastcached`, so a system-scope worker install was refused on the
# one platform that ships the binary. A missing remover is quieter still -- a
# stale account makes the next install pick a DIFFERENT uid, silently orphaning
# the state directory the old one owned.
#
# Why a scan rather than generating the scripts from the C++ (or the other way
# round). Neither can generate the other: the C++ constant is compiled into a
# binary that must answer without the package present, and the postinstall runs on
# a machine where no build tree exists. What can be checked is that they agree,
# and that is what this does -- in milliseconds, on every platform, including the
# ones that cannot run a .pkg at all. That last part is the point: the failure it
# guards is macOS-only, and a check only macOS can run is a check that reports
# after the mistake has already been pushed.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`, for the reasons check-repository-hygiene.cmake states at
# length: this compares strings and reports, so a .sh + .ps1 pair would be two
# implementations of one rule differing only in syntax, and cmake is the one tool
# guaranteed present.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-service-accounts.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every account agrees. 1 = at least one of the three disagrees.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# One row per service account:
#
#   <cmake variable>|<C++ source that names it>|<why this account exists>
#
# The cmake variable is the single source of truth: it is what the top-level
# CMakeLists.txt declares and what packaging/macos/*.in substitute through
# @VAR@. The C++ source is where the same name is compiled into a ServiceSpec.
#
# Adding a service that runs unprivileged is adding a row here, and the check
# then insists the packaging caught up.
#
# No row may contain a ';' -- these are CMake lists, and a semicolon inside a row
# would split it into two.

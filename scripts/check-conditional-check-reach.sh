#
# A check registered only under a build OPTION must have a CI job that both configures
# that build and runs `ctest` in it (#1254, #589).
#
# THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. `tidy-blind-spots` is registered under
# `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME STREQUAL "Linux" AND ENABLE_SANITIZER_ADDRESS AND
# PACE_ENABLE_TLS`. Its own registration block says, in as many words:
#
#     KNOWN RESIDUAL: if that job's flags change, this stops being registered and
#     reports nothing, which reads like a pass. The selftest below runs everywhere and
#     keeps the check itself honest, but nothing yet asserts that some CI job still
#     configures a build this can run in.
#
# That is the whole subject. A conditionally-registered check whose condition no job
# satisfies is ABSENT from every run, and absent reads exactly like passing: `ctest`
# prints a green total over a set that silently no longer contains it. Nothing about
# the output says a check went missing, and nothing can, because a count cannot
# describe a row that is not there.
#
# DERIVED, NEVER RESTATED. The population comes out of `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` by
# walking its `if()` nesting; there is no list of check names in this file. A restated
# list is exact about the entries it knows and silent about the ones it does not, and
# silence reads identically to complete coverage -- so a list would catch a check going
# away and be blind to one ARRIVING, which is the direction that actually happens.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS THE POPULATION, and why it is narrower than "conditionally registered".
# A registration whose false arm calls `pace_register_skipped_test` is already
# honest: the row exists either way and says which state it is in. Those are EXCLUDED,
# so this check measures exactly the registrations that VANISH. Platform conditions
# (`if(NOT WIN32)`) are excluded too -- a platform is not something a job configures,
# and "there is nothing here for this platform to answer" is a different claim with a
# different remedy.
#
# THREE ROUTES TO SATISFACTION, and the third is not optional. An option can be ON
# because a job passed `-DOPT=ON`, because a preset the job names sets it, or because
# its `option()` default is already ON and nobody turned it off. `PACE_BUILD_TUI`
# is the third kind: it appears in NO job and NO preset and is nonetheless on in every
# CI build, because it defaults ON. A check missing that route would report three
# vendor-tui rows as unreachable -- a loud, misattributed finding sending somebody to a
# defect that is not there, which is the same class of error as missing a real one and
# has the worse failure mode.
#
# AND THE JOB MUST RUN `ctest`. Configuring a build the check could be registered in is
# not enough: a job that configures and only BUILDS never runs it. That clause is what
# makes this a reachability check rather than a spelling check.
#
# The workflow is read through `scripts/lib/workflow-walk.awk`, which is this tree's one
# model of workflow YAML -- a private walk here would be refused by
# `ctest -R workflow-walk-sole`, and rightly: four of the five readers it replaced spelled
# `build.yml`'s indentation as literal column counts.
#
# Needs no compiler, no build, no daemon, no socket and no network.

            Fail "${name} is registered only when [${toks}] hold, and NO job in build.yml both configures that and runs ctest. It is therefore absent from every CI run, and absent reads exactly like passing. Remedy, in preference order: (1) make an existing ctest-running job configure it -- add the \`-D\` to that job's configure step; (2) if it genuinely cannot run in CI, give the registration an \`else()\` arm calling \`pace_register_skipped_test\` so the row exists and says why, which also removes it from this check's population; (3) if the check has been superseded, delete it rather than leaving it registered under a condition nothing meets. Do NOT satisfy this by loosening the registration's condition -- the condition describes what the check needs to be meaningful."

# `ci-pr-required.sh` decides which required contexts block a merge. This asserts
# it is WIRED, and `--self-test` drives every verdict it can reach.
#
# The split is the one `ci-merge-group-report.sh` / `check-merge-group-report.sh`
# already uses, and for the same reason: the decision takes a record and calls no
# API, so every verdict is reachable from a synthesised file, while the wiring --
# that the tool exists and reads the SHARED required-context table rather than a
# copy of it -- is a property of the tree and is asserted here.
#
# A guard nobody has watched refuse is not a guard, so every case below states
# which direction it is testing and the negative ones assert the exact verdict
# rather than merely a non-zero exit. "It refused" and "it refused for the reason
# this case exists" are different claims, and only the second one tests anything.

    #   of those, cancelled BEFORE any job ran a step           26
    #   successor runs at those 26 runs' 12 head SHAs           78
    #   successors that never reached a terminal state           0
    #
    #   check runs at those same 12 SHAs                       377
    #   of those, non-terminal                                   0
    #   (sha, name) groups with more than one row                25
    #   groups with >1 row AND a non-terminal sibling            0   <- the trigger
    #
    # Repo-wide, exactly ONE workflow run is stuck non-terminal (45 days, `queued`,
    # zero jobs) and it is a first attempt rather than a replacement -- and it
    # contributes ZERO check-run rows, so it never reaches this tool at all.
    #
    # The census pattern had a positive control on both halves, because a pattern
    # that finds nothing for the wrong reason reports the same zero: two runs
    # cancelled-while-pending were identified by hand from their own API records
    # and both appear in the census's output, and 24 of the 26 have at least one
    # successor, so the successor-finding half fires too.
    #
    # STRUCTURAL REASON, which is why the zero is not just this window's luck: a
    # workflow run cancelled from a pending state emits NO CHECK RUN. `stateOf`
    # reads check runs, so there is no `queued` row for it to see. The ticket's
    # premise appears to be about workflow runs, one level above the object this
    # tool consumes.
    #
    # So NOTHING SHIPPED -- no new state, and `WITHDRAWN`'s predicate is untouched.
    # What lands is this case, which pins the property that makes the absence
    # safe: the RUNNING above is TRANSIENT. Once the replacement completes, the
    # queued row stops mattering because it never outranks a later conclusion.
    # Were that ordering to regress, RUNNING really would become permanent, and
    # this case is what goes red.
    # The queued row is LAST on purpose. Written with the success last, this case is
    # green under ANY row-selection rule -- including `take the last row` -- because
    # the answer it wants IS the last row's. It was written that way first and
    # survived a neuter of the ordering guard while proving nothing. A stale queued
    # row arriving AFTER a conclusion is both the shape that discriminates and the
    # realistic one: the API does not promise chronological order.

# Run scripts/check-instruction-set-flags.cmake over one compile database, for a workflow step, and turn what it
# PRINTED into an exit status (#1442).
#
# ## Why a step, and why this wrapper
#
# The ctests `instruction-set-flags` and `instruction-set-flags-plant` read the database of every configuration that
# runs ctest. The Package jobs configure what SHIPS with tests off, and macOS packages from a configure line and a
# compiler (AppleClang) no test leg uses, so no ctest ever reads their database. A step after each Package job's
# Configure asks both of those questions of the build that ships, before the long build.
#
# That step gates no MERGE: no Package job is a required context (.agent/rules/packaging-and-release.md), so on a pull
# request a red one shows beside the required test legs, which gate through the ctests. It DOES gate the package: the
# step has no continue-on-error, so a refused or inconclusive run stops that Package job before its build -- on a
# release tag too, where the release then waits on that job. That is deliberate: nothing ships from a build whose
# flags were found wrong or could not be judged, and whoever meets a red Package job reads this step's output first.
# The Docker job configures too and is not asked, because its image goes to no registry.
#
# A step is judged by its exit status, and a `cmake -P` check must not be: `message(WARNING)` exits 0, and a script
# that never ran is a `CMake Error` too. So this reads the output of two runs -- the database as it is, and the same
# database with a flag the check must refuse planted into the real commands of `plant_unit` below -- and says which
# of THREE things happened:
#
#   0  clean             the unplanted run printed its summary, the plant run printed its plant summary, and
#                        neither printed a CMake Error or a CMake Warning
#   1  refused           the unplanted run printed its own `instruction-set-flags:` verdict in a CMake Error: a flag,
#                        or a database it cannot judge, and its own words say which
#   2  did not conclude  anything else -- cmake missing or not starting, the script missing, an error that is not the
#                        check's verdict, a warning, no summary, or a plant run that did not pass, which leaves a
#                        clean reading of THIS database never shown able to fail. Nothing was judged, and this says
#                        so rather than passing or blaming the tree.
#
# cmake's own exit status is printed and decides nothing.
#

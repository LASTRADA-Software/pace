# End-to-end test of distributed compilation (Windows).
#
# The POSIX counterpart (scripts/dist-compile-e2e.sh) asserts seven properties;
# this one deliberately asserts fewer, and the reason is worth stating rather
# than leaving as an apparent omission.
#
# What is genuinely Windows-specific here is the MSVC DRIVER, and nothing else.
# The scheduler, the lease table, the slot accounting and every refusal path are
# platform-neutral code already covered by unit tests and by the POSIX fixture.
# What is NOT covered anywhere else is that an MSVC driver can be preprocessed
# for a worker and then compile that text: `DriverSpec::dispatchPreprocessFlags`
# is `/E` for MSVC, and `preprocessedInput` names the language in MSVC's own
# spelling (`/TP`, `/TC`) because the worker writes its scratch file itself and
# MSVC reads the language off that file's extension.
#
# Both of those are assertions about a driver that had never been exercised on
# this path. If either is wrong, distribution silently never works on Windows:
# every dispatched translation unit fails and is retried locally, so the build is
# correct, green, and never once helped -- which is exactly the failure the GNU
# side of this already hit, twice.
#
# So the cases here are the ones that would catch that:
#
#   1. Equivalent object -- a worker's object matches a locally compiled one.
#   2. Still a cache     -- a dispatched result is served from the cache next time.
#  2b. Saved mid-dispatch -- a save landing after the key was taken and before the `/E`
#                           dispatch preprocess reads the source stores nothing: the
#                           worker compiled the SAVED content, and its object must never
#                           be filed under the key of the content it replaced (#1650).
#   3. C, not C++        -- a dispatched C translation unit comes back compiled as C.
#  3b. Root-bound        -- a dispatched object naming its checkout (the builtin
#                           `source_location` is made of) is not served into a second
#                           checkout, and is served back to the first.
#  3c. One spelling      -- a header one dispatched compile reaches through two include
#                           chains is ONE /showIncludes note, with no `..` in any note.
#   4. Fingerprint       -- a worker for another toolchain is never chosen.
#
# "MATCHES" IS NOT BYTE-IDENTICAL HERE, and every part of that is measured rather
# than assumed -- the POSIX fixture asserts byte-identity and is right to, because
# an ELF object records none of this.
#
# Both MSVC drivers write the CLOCK into the COFF header: two compiles of one file
# to one path two seconds apart differ in exactly byte 4, and only `/Brepro`
# suppresses it. A fixture that passed `/Brepro` to make its own assertion true
# would be asserting something about a command line no build uses.
#
# clang-cl records one further thing, the source's BASE NAME in the COFF `.file`
# symbol -- which the worker is now told, so that difference is gone rather than
# excused. `cl` records the ABSOLUTE PATH OF THE OBJECT in `.debug$S` and hashes
# the file it opened into `.chks64`, with no debug flag asked for, and a worker
# compiles its own scratch file to its own scratch path: neither can ever match.
# Everything carrying code or data does: measured, `.text$mn`, `.rdata`, `.xdata`,
# `.pdata`, `.drectve`, `.data$r` and `.bss` are byte-identical between a reference
# compile of the original source and a worker-shaped compile of `/E` text at
# another path.
#
# So each driver asserts the strongest property it can actually carry, off a table,
# and a difference anywhere else -- a section, or a header field such as the target
# architecture -- is still a failure.

# short name, the two drivers disagree about it, and every root test in the
# launcher is a string prefix comparison. The reconciliation added for issue #66
# handles that now, but a fixture whose roots are ambiguous is testing the
# reconciliation as well as its own property.
#
# The BASE of every run. Each run claims a root of its own under it
# (`New-E2ERunRoot`, never reused), and each driver gets a directory of its own under
# that and a port block of its own (see the driver loop), because a process is not
# known to be gone when whatever follows it starts: `Stop-Spawned` bounds its wait
# and a killed process can outlive the bound. Between RUNS the same thing happened:
# with one root cleared at each start, an immediate rerun died in 0 s on
# "raft-log ... being used by another process" while the holders' PIDs sat in the
# previous run's log. So old roots are swept best-effort, and one that will not go
# is reported with the processes whose command line names it. With one directory shared between the
# drivers, the second one's `Remove-Item` met the first one's isolation worker
# still holding `iso-worker.log` and failed the run with "being used by another
# process" -- a teardown overlap reported as a fault of the case that ran next.
# Not a LOG name problem: with every kill made late, the same removal met the
# isolation scheduler's `raft-log` first, and a state directory has no per-driver
# name to give it. Waiting longer only moves that line; sharing nothing removes it.
#
# Nor is it only this run's processes: Defender opens a file to scan it when its last
# writer closes it, and a delete meeting that handle fails with a sharing violation.
# Measured: `iso-scheduler.log` refused its delete with the Restart Manager naming
# `WinDefend` as the only holder, and the run failed as "The process cannot access the
# file" with every case green.

# dispatched, and the fixture reports "the compile was not dispatched to a

#
# A socket that is BOUND is not one that is ACCEPTING, and neither is one that is
# SERVING. Every marker in the table above is emitted strictly after the last
# acceptor arms, precisely because the bind is reachable while nothing will
# answer. Six sites here waited on the connect alone, so #634's node fix and
# #644's daemon fix reached the POSIX fixture and stopped at the language
# boundary. What it produces is the race #634 measured as case 8 -- a node
# compiled against immediately after its bind -- presenting on Windows as *the
# compile was not dispatched to a worker*, which sends the reader to the
# scheduler.
#
# ## Why the bind leg is KEPT rather than replaced
#
# It names a class the marker cannot: a process that exits before it ever
# listens, with its own log printed. Dropping it would turn every such startup
# refusal into one undifferentiated readiness timeout.
#
# ## The two refusals, and why they are refusals rather than waits
#
# A role with no row and an empty log path are both PROGRAMMER errors, and both
# fail toward silence if they are allowed through: an absent marker would make
# `Contains('')` true on the first poll, so the wait would return instantly
# having established nothing -- the PowerShell shape of the `grep -q "$marker" -`
# hazard `_e2e_wait_ready` refuses by name on the POSIX side.

# What "the same object" means, per driver, and why it is not one answer.
#
# Measured on MSVC 14.51 and clang-cl, by compiling the same text at different
# paths and comparing section by section:
#
#   clang-cl records the source's BASE NAME (the COFF `.file` symbol) and nothing
#   else about where it ran, and the worker is told that name -- so nothing but the
#   clock may differ, and an empty row is what says so. That strictness is load-
#   bearing rather than tidy: it is what fails, end to end, if the client ever
#   stops telling the worker what to call its scratch file. Verified by making it
#   stop.
#
#   cl additionally writes the ABSOLUTE PATH OF THE OBJECT into `.debug$S`, with no
#   debug flag asked for, and `.chks64` hashes the file it actually opened. A worker
#   compiles its own scratch file to its own scratch path, so neither can ever
#   match; every other section does, and those are the ones carrying code.

        #     case still passes -- which is the point of stating it explicitly
        #     rather than letting it ride on a file name;
        #   - with only `/TC` removed, the name carries it instead, and the CASE 1
        #     leg on clang-cl is what fails, because its symbol table then records
        #     a name this machine never compiled.

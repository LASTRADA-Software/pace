# Sweep this branch's changed translation units with the PINNED clang-tidy.
#
# This is what the `clang-tidy` CI job runs. `scripts/local-gate.sh` gets the
# same checks the other way, through the `clang-debug` preset's build; this is
# for where that preset cannot be built, and for reproducing what CI will say.
# It needs a compile database and nothing else -- no objects, no link.
#
# **It verifies the tool actually RUNS before believing a clean result.** That is
# the whole reason this is a script rather than a one-line loop: a wrapper that
# cannot exec, a binary extracted without its execute bit, or one that cannot find
# its own resource headers all produce *silence*, and silence filtered through a
# grep for "error:" reads exactly like success. That mistake has already sent a
# branch to CI twice with findings a local sweep had reported clean.
#
# **And that its HEADER findings reach the report.** A finding in a header is kept
# only when `.clang-tidy`'s HeaderFilterRegex takes the header's path as clang spells
# it on this host; the rest is discarded as non-user code in the same silence. A
# `/`-only pattern did exactly that on Windows, where the path carries backslashes,
# and the `clang-tidy-windows` leg reported clean without keeping a single header
# finding. So a second canary plants a finding in two headers and refuses to go on
# unless the analyser reports both.
#
# **What it sweeps is the diff plus everything the diff can break.** A changed
# header is not a translation unit, so tidying only the changed `.cpp` files would
# let an edit to `Logger.hpp` land a finding in fifty files nobody checked. The
# scope is therefore the changed `.cpp` files UNION every `.cpp` that transitively
# includes a changed header -- and any change to a file that decides how *every*
# translation unit is interpreted (`.clang-tidy`, a `CMakeLists.txt`, a `.cmake`
# module, this script) escalates to the full sweep instead. Everything about the
# scope errs towards sweeping MORE: an over-approximation costs minutes, an
# under-approximation costs a red build on master for code a pull request was
# told was clean.
#
# Getting the pinned binary (no root needed): the ONE build `.clang-tidy-version`
# declares, as the PyPI wheel it names (#1404), into the site this script and
# `local-gate.sh` look in when `TIDY` is unset:
#
#   python3 -m pip install --target "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/fastcached/clang-tidy/<version>" \
#       "$(bash scripts/check-clang-tidy-version.sh --requirement)"
#
# A host whose python3 has no pip can unzip the wheel into that directory instead
# (`python3 -m zipfile -e <wheel> <dir>`, then `chmod +x` the binary, which the zip
# loses). Run the binary from where it sits: clang-tidy resolves its resource headers
# relative to itself, and the identity check below reads the wheel's METADATA and
# RECORD beside it.
#
# And the database is configured **through the preset the CI job configures**,
# with CI's own flags, into a directory of its own:
#
#   cmake --preset clang-debug -B out/build/tidy22 -DENABLE_TIDY=OFF \
#         -DCMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES=OFF -DPACE_ENABLE_TLS=ON \
#         -DPACE_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON -DPACE_BUILD_TESTCLIENT=ON
#
# That line is the `clang-tidy` job's `Configure` step verbatim plus `-B`, and
# `check-tidy-sweep-database.sh` asserts it stays that way. It is deliberately NOT
# a hand-rolled `cmake -S . -B … -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ …` equivalent, which
# is what stood here until #454: such a line inherits `PEDANTIC_COMPILER` and
# `PEDANTIC_COMPILER_WERROR` OFF and omits the two default-OFF app targets CI
# turns on, so it diverges from CI both in the flags that decide what the sweep
# REPORTS and in the translation units it can see at all -- in both directions,
# and every one of them reading like a clean tree.
#
# **The measurements are in .agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md**, beside the same
# configure line. They are not repeated here on purpose: a figure restated in
# several places is a figure that gets updated in one, which is that file's own
# rule and the reason it was worth writing down.
#
# `-B` is what keeps this out of your own `out/build/clang-debug` tree -- it
# overrides the preset's `binaryDir`, so configuring the sweep's database does not
# turn `ENABLE_TIDY` and module scanning off in the build `local-gate.sh` uses.
#
# The preset settles the two things this database has to get right on its own:
# it is a CLANG database (pointed at a GCC one, clang-tidy inherits flags it does
# not know), and `-DCMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES=OFF` is passed explicitly because
# the `@…modmap` flags a module-scanning generator emits do not exist until that
# target has been built, and a translation unit that fails to parse reports
# nothing.
#
# What following this line does NOT buy you: the same COMPILER. `clang-debug`
# names bare `clang++`, and `PedanticCompiler.cmake` adds each warning flag only
# if `check_cxx_compiler_flag` accepts it, so an older clang on your `PATH` still
# yields a flag set that can differ from CI's -- along the very
# `clang-diagnostic-*` axis all of the above is about. The pinned version applies
# to the ANALYSER (`TIDY=`, above); the configuring compiler is whatever `PATH`
# offers, and nothing here checks it.
#
# Usage:  [TIDY=<the declared clang-tidy build>] [DB=out/build/tidy22] [BASE=origin/master] \
#         [JOBS=4] scripts/tidy-sweep.sh [--all|--ci|--self-test]

#   --all        sweep every translation unit in the database, whatever changed.
#   --ci         take the scope and the base from `CiScopeTable` and the event in
#                the environment (`GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`, `GITHUB_BASE_REF`,
#                `MERGE_GROUP_BASE_SHA`). This is how the workflow invokes it, so
#                that the event -> (scope, base) mapping lives in one place a
#                reader can see whole rather than in three CI expressions.
#   --self-test  check the scope computation against a synthetic tree, and both
#                canaries' verdicts against staged probe records, then exit. Needs
#                no compile database and no clang-tidy -- which is the whole
#                point of the second one: until #257 the canary's decision could
#                only be exercised by a machine already running a full sweep with
#                a working analyser, which is the population it is not for.
set -u

# 4.4 rather than 4.0, and each digit is load-bearing: associative arrays are 4.0,
# `wait -n` is 4.3, and expanding an EMPTY array as `"${a[@]}"` under `set -u` stops
# being an "unbound variable" error at 4.4 -- which this script does on any tree
# with nothing changed. macOS ships 3.2; `brew install bash` is the answer there.
#
# What an interpreter below the floor MEANS depends on what was asked, and the two
# answers are not the same (#588). A sweep genuinely cannot run here, so it refuses.
# The self-test is registered in the DEFAULT ctest set, which runs on every platform
# CI builds -- so on a stock macOS runner it has to produce a visible SKIPPED, and
# the two ways of getting that wrong are symmetric: registering it naively turns a
# silent non-registration into a red macOS leg, and "fixing" that by dropping it on
# macOS at configure time puts it back to a check that does not exist and does not
# say so. `SKIP_RETURN_CODE 77` -- the idiom `fetch-transfer-bound` already uses --
# is how ctest is told which of the four states this is.
#
# A configure-time guard could not answer this anyway: the floor is a property of
# whichever `bash` the machine has at RUN time, and a macOS runner can carry 3.2 at
# /bin/bash and 5.x from Homebrew. Only the interpreter actually running can say.
#
# Asked HERE rather than after the argument loop far below, because it must be
# settled before anything 4.4-only executes. `${1+"$@"}` and not `"$@"`, for the
# very reason 4.4 is the floor: on 3.2 the bare form is an unbound-variable error
# when there are no arguments, so this guard would die instead of reporting.
# `--self-test` AND NOTHING ELSE. The canonical parse is far below, after code this
# interpreter may not be able to run, so this is a second place the command line is
# read -- and two readings that can disagree are worse than one that is coarse.
# `--self-test --all` is a full sweep on a modern bash (the real loop is last-wins),
# so answering "skipped self-test" for it on 3.2 would have the two interpreters
# reporting different outcomes for one command line, in the green-reading direction.
# Anything else falls through to the sweep's refusal, which is what a modern bash
# does with it too.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Scope
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What CI asks for, as ONE table, because the SCOPE decision used to be two
# GitHub expressions plus the shell here, and nothing stated the mapping (#570).
#
# The `BASE:` env expression and the `--all` argument expression each carried a
# piece of it in `.github/workflows/build.yml`, so answering "what happens on
# event X" meant composing GitHub expression syntax with shell. The report step's
# `if:` is a THIRD per-event expression there and has deliberately NOT moved
# here: it decides who is TOLD about a failure, not how wide the analysis is, and
# folding a notification rule into the scope table would make the table describe
# two things, which is the opposite of what #570 asked for. Its acceptance is
# worded around all three, so the deviation is stated here rather than left for a
# reader to notice: two moved, the third stays, and `check-tidy-sweep-scope.sh`
# rule C still checks it where it is. The soundness argument #554 rests on -- that
# the master push is the only full sweep, and the diff-scoped events are exactly
# the two that have a base to diff against -- is checkable only where the mapping
# can be read whole.
#
# Rows are matched in order; anything not named falls to `CiScopeDefaultRow`.
# That default is the whole point rather than a tidy-up. The guard used to be
# spelled as an exclusion (`event_name != 'pull_request' && event_name !=
# 'merge_group'`) precisely so that a trigger added to `on:` later would sweep
# everything instead of diff-scoping against a base whose diff on master is
# EMPTY -- which makes the sweep print `no source changed` and exit 0 having
# analysed nothing. A table with a default row is that property made structural:
# there is no spelling of it left to get backwards.
#
#   <event>        <scope>  <where BASE comes from>
CiScopeTable=(
    "pull_request  diff     pull-request-base-ref"
    "merge_group   diff     merge-queue-base-sha"
)

# Every other event this workflow can dispatch a sweep from -- a `push` to
# master, a tag push, and any trigger added to `on:` later. `BASE` is not read.
#
# ## A release tag KEEPS the full sweep, and that is a decision (#571)
#
# It used to be an accident of an expression: the condition covered tags because it
# covered pushes, and a version tag is almost always placed on a commit master's own
# push has already swept -- so the release run re-analyses a tree with a known-clean
# result, at about 22.5 minutes. Recorded here rather than left implied, because the
# next reader arrives at this row wondering exactly that.
#
# MEASURED first, since #571 asks the question the other way round: does `origin/master`
# resolve on a tag checkout, and what would the diff hold? Neither is reachable --
# a tag push is `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME=push`, it matches this row, and this row's base is
# `none`, so `BASE` is never consulted on that path at all:
#
#     CiScopeFor push          ->  all   (base empty)
#     CiScopeFor pull_request  ->  diff  origin/master
#     CiScopeFor merge_group   ->  diff  origin/master
#
# So the tempting narrowing is not merely unnecessary, it is unsound, and in the
# direction that fails QUIET. A tag sits ON master, so a diff against `origin/master`
# from a tag checkout is EMPTY -- the sweep would print `no source changed`, exit 0 and
# analyse NOTHING, on the one commit that is about to become an artefact. That is the
# opposite failure to paying 22.5 minutes, and much worse: a release is the last gate
# before something ships, which is precisely where a full sweep is most defensible and
# where analysing nothing is least detectable.
#
# The cost is also not merge latency. A tag run blocks no pull request and nobody waits
# on it, so this is runner-minutes -- the same distinction the workflow's own header
# draws about master pushes, and the two quantities get quoted for each other.
CiScopeDefaultRow="*  all  none"

# The mapping, as a pure function of the three things it depends on.
#
# Pure and separately callable for the reason `InterpreterVerdict` is: the
# environment it reads exists only inside a GitHub runner, so a decision made
# inline at the call site is untestable BY CONSTRUCTION. `SelfTest` drives every
# row of the table above through this, which is what makes the mapping something
# a reader can both see whole and see refused.

# @return Prints `<scope>\t<base>`, `<base>` empty when the scope is `all`.
#         Exit 2 when a row names a scope or a base this function cannot resolve,
#         and when NO row matched at all -- a fourth state must not arrive
#         silently as a third. Both columns are checked and the fall-off-the-end
#         is a refusal, because every one of those failures reads downstream as
#         `mode=diff` against `origin/master`, whose diff on master is EMPTY: the

# PURE: reads preprocessed output on stdin, prints `produced` or `empty`, and
# touches nothing else. That split is the whole point. The defect being fixed is
# that a file compiling to an EMPTY translation unit reads as COVERED -- it has a
# compile command, so it never reaches the "not a translation unit here" drop path,
# and five independent signals reported success over nothing: the database listed
# it, clang-tidy processed it and found nothing, gcc built it, clang built it, and
# ctest ran a binary containing zero of its cases. It held a syntax error
# throughout, and only CI's macOS leg could see it.
#
# `not compiled` and `compiled to nothing` look identical from outside and are not
# the same claim. The second is worse, because it produces POSITIVE evidence.
#
# Because the classification is pure, `--self-test` drives every verdict from
# synthesised linemarker text with no compiler, no database and no clang-tidy. Only
# the preprocessor run in `UnitContribution` is impure, and that half decides
# nothing.
#

# line of a clang-cl preprocess, so EVERY unit would classify `empty` -- the exact
# "absence rendered as evidence of absence" this function exists to prevent, and
# invisible on the platform anybody develops on. Separators are normalised for the

# What one unit's run of clang-tidy says about that unit.

# A non-zero exit is how clang-tidy reports FINDINGS, and is also how it reports

# diagnostic at all. The finding filter below then finds no line, and the unit used to
# be summed into `TIDY SWEEP CLEAN` -- a file that was never read, reported clean. So
# the exit status is read together with the output: non-zero with no diagnostic line
# of ANY kind is `unanalysed`, a failure of the sweep and never a pass.
#
# `clean` needs a reason, and there are two: a zero exit, or a non-zero one whose only
# DIAGNOSTIC lines are unknown-warning-option ones (`FindingLines` drops them: GCC-only
# flags a clang build ignores). Non-diagnostic lines are TOLERATED in that second case
# -- an `Error while processing`, even a `Stack dump:` -- and that leniency is bounded
# on purpose rather than by accident: a crash exits at or above 126, which is `fatal`
# before this row is reached (128 plus the signal on POSIX; measured under Git Bash on
# Windows, for a RELEASE-CRT program: an access violation 139, a stack overflow,
# `__fastfail` and `abort()` each 127). A DEBUG-CRT `abort()` exits 3 (measured), below
# that line -- and the release case is the one that applies, measured from the pinned
# 22.1.8 `clang-tidy.exe`'s import table: `VCRUNTIME140.dll`, `VCRUNTIME140_1.dll`,
# `MSVCP140.dll` and the `api-ms-win-crt-*` set, with no `ucrtbased`, `vcruntime140d` or
# `msvcp140d`. A Debug-CRT crash that printed no diagnostic line would reach `unanalysed`
# rather than `fatal`: still a failure, never `clean`. And a run that analysed nothing because no check was
# enabled is the canary's question, asked once before any unit. Anything else falls to
# `unanalysed` -- the table fails CLOSED, so a combination nobody thought of reads as a

# The HEADER canary's decision: was a finding planted in each named header REPORTED?
#
# `Canary` proves the analyser parses a unit, which says nothing about headers: a
# finding in a header is reported only when `.clang-tidy`'s HeaderFilterRegex takes the
# header's path AS CLANG SPELLS IT, and everything else is discarded as non-user code
# with nothing to show for it but a `Suppressed N warnings` line. On Windows that path
# carries a backslash wherever clang joined an include directory to a header name, and
# a `/`-only pattern discarded every first-party header finding there while the
# `clang-tidy-windows` leg reported clean. `local-gate.sh` asks the same question of a
# MODEL of the regex engine on every host; this asks the analyser itself, on the host
# the sweep runs on, before any verdict is believed.
#
# The failing arms are four because the remedies are: `filtered` is the header filter
# refusing a path (clang-tidy SAID it suppressed something), `unreported` is a finding
# that never happened at all -- no line, no suppression, so the check that should fire
# is off or the header was never read -- `config-unread` is clang-tidy refusing the
# `--config-file` it was handed, and the unit-level arms are `CanaryVerdict`'s, asked
# first, since a probe that did not parse says nothing about any of them.
#
# `config-unread` has its own arm because it is how a path that did not survive the
# trip to the analyser looks -- on the Windows leg, an MSYS conversion that went wrong
# -- and it exits 1 with no finding and no suppression, which `unreported` would send
# looking for a disabled check.
#
# A header is matched by its BASENAME at the end of a path spelled with EITHER
# separator, since the line naming it on Windows is `C:\...\src\tests\X.hpp:3:12:`, AND
# by the PLANTED check's tag. Any finding at the header is not enough: a compile error
# in a header is reported whatever HeaderFilterRegex says -- measured, the `/`-only
# pattern reports `[clang-diagnostic-error]` from a header it filters -- so counting it
# would pass the canary over the very filter it exists to test.
#
# @param 1 The probe's exit status.
# @param 2 Everything the probe printed, stdout and stderr together.
# @param 3.. The basename of each header a finding was planted in.

#         <output>`, or a `CanaryVerdict` failure word.

# The unit of work is a COMPILE COMMAND, not a file, and that is what keeps this
# equivalent to the build-driven tidy it replaced. A source compiled into two
# targets is two translation units with two preprocessor states -- `Stats.cpp`
# builds into `pace-cc`, `pace-cc-tests` and `pace-node`,
# and those targets do not agree about `FC_COMPRESSION_ENABLED` -- so one
# invocation per file would silently stop checking the other configurations.
#
# `clang-tidy -p <dir> <file>` does NOT take the first matching entry: libTooling's
# `ClangTool::run` asks the database for the commands of a file and then loops over
# **all** of them. So a file with one command needs nothing special, and a file with
# several must not ALSO be handed to the shared database -- that invocation already
# analyses every one of its commands, and the per-command databases would then
# re-analyse each of them a second time. A file is therefore served by the shared
# database when it has exactly one command, and by one single-entry database per
# command when it has more. The unit of work stays the compile command either way;
# what changes is that each is analysed exactly once.
#
# Reading the database is also the only honest answer to what this platform
# compiles: `IocpReactor.cpp` is a translation unit on Windows and a file on
# Linux, so a list taken from `git ls-files` alone would fail a full sweep on
# sources no target here builds.
#
# **First-party means git knows about the file**, and that is the definition
# rather than an exclusion list of directories. A fetched dependency's sources
# are compile-database entries like any other -- Catch2, yaml-cpp and lz4 are
# ~150 of the 594 here -- and where they LAND is configuration: `_deps/` under
# the build tree by default, but `$CPM_SOURCE_CACHE` anywhere, which in CI is
# `.cache/CPM` INSIDE the workspace. A path-shaped exclusion gets that wrong the
# moment somebody moves the cache, and gets it wrong in the direction that makes
# a full sweep fail on somebody else's code. The intersection with what git
# tracks also subsumes the absolute-path and out-of-tree cases for free.

# `TidyHeaderCanarySibling.hpp` by a quote include beside the unit (on Windows,
# `...\src\tests\TidyHeaderCanarySibling.hpp`) and `TidyHeaderCanaryIncluded.hpp` through
# `-I<root>/src` and `<Pace/...>` (on Windows, `...\src\Pace/...`, the mixed
# spelling). Both must be REPORTED under this tree's own `.clang-tidy`, or the sweep
# stops: a clean verdict from a run that discards every header finding is a claim about
# no header at all. Measured with the pinned clang-tidy, natively on Windows from Git
# Bash, which is how the `clang-tidy-windows` job calls it, and with no compile database,
# since this unit brings its own flags: under the `/`-only pattern both findings are
# suppressed and this refuses; under `[/\\]` both are reported. On Linux it passes under
# either pattern, because clang spells the paths with `/` there; the backslash half is
# checked on the Windows leg alone, and on Linux by `local-gate.sh`'s model of the regex.

# `--config-file` names the configuration so the one under test is this tree's whether

# includes nothing else, and the header filter is a question about PATHS.

# A compile database is not a tree that PARSES. clang-tidy reads each unit the way the
# compiler would, so a header the build generates has to exist -- and the clang-tidy job
# configures without building. libunicode, which core-cpp's terminal UI links, writes its
# `ucd_enums.h` and eight more tables into its SOURCE directory at build time, so a CPM
# cache that never saw a build has none of them. CI refused #1392 on exactly that
# (`TerminalCellWidth.cpp`: 'libunicode/ucd_enums.h' file not found), where every local
# gate had passed: the gate builds before it tidies.
#
# So the sweep builds the object-order phony targets: every generated input any unit
# needs, and no object. The set is DERIVED from the build the database came from, so it
# names neither libunicode's nine files nor its generator target -- `unicode_ucd`, whose
# `cmake_object_order_depends_target_unicode_ucd` is one of them -- and a generated header
# that some other dependency adds tomorrow is covered the same way. Measured on the #134
# tree, WSL, clang-debug, a fresh CPM cache: 28 targets, 21 edges, six compiles (the table
# generator) and 3 s, after which that unit is analysed.
#
# Every way of not generating is FATAL, never a skip: a database this cannot ask (every
# preset here is Ninja's), no ninja, no such targets, or a failed build. And a unit still
# missing a header after all that is refused below as not preprocessable, by name -- the
# sweep does not report clean over a unit it could not parse. No dry-run "nothing left to

# In `--all`/`--ci` an `empty` unit is the guard working (a platform-gated file on
# the other platform) and an `unknown` is reported and survivable, because the sweep
# chose the set itself. Here the caller chose it: the whole point of `--only` is
# that these particular files ARE analysed on THIS platform, so a fold to `empty`
# means the leg covered nothing and `TIDY SWEEP CLEAN` would say the opposite.
#
# That is not hypothetical. On this leg's first real run every one of the six came
# back `unknown` (Git Bash had mangled the command line) while clang-tidy itself
# produced findings -- so once those findings are fixed the leg would have printed
# `CLEAN (0 of 6 file(s) contributed code)` and exited 0, over the exact blind spot
# it was added to close.

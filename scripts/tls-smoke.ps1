# TLS smoke test (Windows). Start pace-kv with TLS terminated using the
# checked-in self-signed cert, connect with a .NET SslStream (no external
# openssl needed on the client side), send a RESP PING, and assert the daemon
# answers +PONG over the encrypted channel.
#
# Usage:
#   tls-smoke.ps1 -Fastcached <path> -Cert <pem> -Key <pem> [-Port <n>]
#
# The port is DRAWN per run unless one is passed; a passed one is probed first and
# a leftover listener is refused by name. See scripts/lib/E2EPorts.psm1.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = +PONG over TLS; 1 = ran but no PONG; 77 = a runtime
# prerequisite (pace-kv / cert) was missing — treated as a skip.

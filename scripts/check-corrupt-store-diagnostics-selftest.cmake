# Policies are pinned for the reason the check itself states.
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.28)
#
# `corrupt-store-diagnostics` must be SEEN to refuse, on each thing it claims and
# on nothing else.
#
# The check is a docs-subject check: it reads `docs/operations/corrupt-store.md`
# and the sources that compose what the page quotes, and it exists because those
# diagnostics were asserted by nothing (#633). A guard nobody has watched refuse
# is not a guard, so every rule it carries gets an arm here.
#
# ## The two directions that matter
#
# `wording` is the false-positive guard: rewording the prose AROUND a quote must
# be free, or the check is the change-detector #633 explicitly warns against.
# `shardPath` and `suffix` are the true positives -- the field-level assertions
# that were unreachable by unit test, because the daemon's composer sits in an
# anonymous namespace behind `add_executable(pace-kv main.cpp)` with no test
# target, and the node's suffix is composed in a third file again.
#
# ## INCONCLUSIVE, and why this harness is born with it
#
# [#747](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/747) records that
# this tree's two older selftest harnesses cannot tell *the rule fired* from *the
# invocation never ran*: one reads any non-zero status as a refusal, the other
# ignores `RESULT_VARIABLE` entirely. Under load -- a box at 82 across 32 CPUs,
# with the OOM killer taking builds at exit 137 -- a killed spawn then reports as
# a rule regression, and a lane spent nine runs hunting a phantom because of it.
#
# Fixing those two is #747 and is deliberately not done here. Writing a THIRD
# instance of a defect filed the same day would be indefensible, so this harness
# distinguishes the state from its first commit: a spawn that could not run is
# reported INCONCLUSIVE, by name, and never folded into pass or fail.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-corrupt-store-diagnostics-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

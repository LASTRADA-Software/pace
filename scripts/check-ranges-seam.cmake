# No first-party C++ calls a range algorithm that core-cpp's `<core/Ranges.hpp>` wraps
# directly: `std::ranges::iota` is spelled `core::ranges::Iota`, `std::ranges::fold_left`
# is spelled `core::ranges::FoldLeft`, and so on for every facility that header wraps. It was
# `src/Pace/Core/Ranges.hpp` until #1596 moved it into core-cpp; see `seamHeader` below.
#
# ## Why the seam exists
#
# `Package (macOS .pkg)` compiles with AppleClang over Apple's own libc++, which has no
# `std::ranges::iota`. PR #1392 went red there on `DashboardPanel.cpp` with every REQUIRED
# context green -- libstdc++, the MSVC STL and the Homebrew LLVM libc++ of `macOS-clang-release`
# all ship it. The owner kept the C++23 spelling rather than retreat to `std::iota` and
# `std::accumulate`, so `Ranges.hpp` selects the standard function object where its
# feature-test macro says the library ships it, and a transcription of the standard where it
# does not. The header carries the argument in full.
#
# ## Why a check and not only the header
#
# Because the failure lands on a job nobody is required to wait for. A direct call builds on
# every leg a developer runs locally and on every required context, so the first place it can
# fail is a packaging job that runs after the pull request looks finished -- or at release
# time. And a build stops at its first failure: the `fold_left` in `FrameEndpoint.cpp` sat
# behind the `iota` and was never reached, so fixing only the reported site would have moved
# the red one file along. This runs in the DEFAULT ctest set, where every developer meets it.
#
# ## What is scanned
#
# First-party C++, DERIVED rather than listed: every tracked C++ source (`git ls-files`, or a
# directory walk where there is no index), minus the third-party roots read from
# `scripts/lib/third-party-roots.txt` -- vendored code is not ours to edit, and is counted as
# declined rather than dropped silently. Tests, the benchmarks and the test client count:
# they are first-party C++ and the macOS legs that build them use a libc++ too.
#
# ## What is refused, derived from the header
#
# The set of wrapped facilities is READ from `Ranges.hpp`, never restated here: every selection
# block of the shape
#
#     #if defined(__cpp_lib_<feature>) ...
#     inline constexpr auto <Name> = std::ranges::<name>;
#
# contributes one row -- the standard name refused, the seam name offered, the macro that gates
# it. A restated list would catch a facility going away and be blind to one ARRIVING, which is
# the direction that matters: a row added to the header is enforced here with no edit. A header
# this check derives no row from is REFUSED, never read as "nothing to enforce".
#
# A USE is `ranges::<name>` followed by something that cannot continue an identifier, in code
# with comments stripped (`fastcached_scan_code_lines`, `scripts/lib/CheckCommon.cmake`). So
# `std::ranges::iota` and a bare `ranges::iota` under a `using namespace std;` are refused, and
# `std::views::iota` and `std::ranges::iota_view` -- C++20, shipped everywhere -- are not.
# The seam spelling differs by CASE (`Ranges::Iota`), which is what lets one case-sensitive
# pattern tell the two apart.
#
# Exempt, and derived from the one path below rather than listed: the seam header itself, and
# its test beside it by the house `Foo.hpp` / `Foo_test.cpp` convention, which has to name the
# standard facility to assert the fallback agrees with it. Both must EXIST, or the exemption
# describes nothing.
#
# ## Blind spots, stated
#
# - A namespace alias (`namespace sr = std::ranges; sr::iota(...)`) is not seen. Nothing in
#   this tree aliases `std::ranges`; the census below says so.
# - The token inside a STRING LITERAL reads as code and would be refused, as in every
#   regex-shaped reader here; reword rather than widen.
# - This enforces the seam, not the portability of C++23 in general. A range algorithm the
#   header does not wrap is not refused -- `std::ranges::contains`, used across the tree,
#   builds on every leg today.
#
# The census this was written against, with its pattern: `git grep -nE
# 'ranges::(iota|fold_left|fold_left_first|fold_right|fold_right_last|fold_left_with_iter|fold_left_first_with_iter)\b'`
# over the whole repository at `8b8a9d39` found THREE direct calls, all under `src/`:
# `DashboardPanel.cpp` and `FrameEndpoint.cpp` (new on that branch) and `CowTreeStorage_test.cpp`
# (on master already, unseen by the package job because it builds no tests). `git grep -nE
# 'namespace [A-Za-z_]+ *= *std::ranges|using namespace std::ranges|using std::ranges::'`
# found none.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports
# failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> [-DGIT_EXECUTABLE=<git>] -P scripts/check-ranges-seam.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

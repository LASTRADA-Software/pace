# Every executable a test launches carries the Windows error-popup suppression, or says why
# it does not (#1389).
#
# ## What this reads, and why not CMakeLists.txt
#
# `cmake/ErrorPopups.cmake` attaches `src/tests/ErrorPopupsAtStartup.cpp` to every
# executable by walking the build system. That is a CLAIM about what was attached; the
# artefact is the generated link line. A walk filtered to the wrong roots, or called before
# the `add_subdirectory` that defines a target, leaves an executable that builds, runs, and
# hangs on the one run that asserts -- and every CMakeLists would still read correctly. So
# the set is derived from three generated files, and none of it is listed here:
#
#   * `error-popups-<config>.manifest`: every executable in the source tree, the file ctest
#     would launch, its policy, and a stated reason when it is exempt. Taken at the END of
#     configure over the whole tree, never through the walk's own roots, or a root the walk
#     left out would be absent from the census as well -- measured, and green;
#   * every `CTestTestfile.cmake`: an executable is LAUNCHED when its path appears there --
#     as a test's command or as an argument a script is handed, which is how the e2e
#     fixtures reach the product binaries -- or when a `catch_discover_tests` include file
#     named after it does;
#   * `build.ninja`: a launched executable is COVERED when its link edge for this
#     configuration names the attached object.
#
# And a second property, read from the same registrations and the `_tests.cmake` files
# `catch_discover_tests` generates: EVERY registered test sets VARIABLE. A product binary
# suppresses only when that variable is in its environment, so a test that does not set it
# is a test whose spawned `pace-kv` still waits on the dialog -- and the object being
# linked says nothing about that.
#
# ## Outcomes
#
# A launched executable that is neither covered nor exempt is REFUSED, by name. So is
# every way of not being able to ask: no manifest, an empty one, a reason this reader
# cannot carry, and an anchor (`PaceTest`) that is not launched-and-covered, since a
# derivation that proves nothing about the one executable certain to be there proves
# nothing at all. A generator that writes no `build.ninja` is a SKIP, naming it -- the
# presets all use Ninja, and a reader claiming to parse a format it does not is worse.
#
# A path is matched with a BOUNDARY after it, never as a bare substring: on POSIX
# `target/pace-cc` is a prefix of `target/pace-cc-tests`.
#
# Usage: cmake -DBUILD_DIR=<dir> -DCONFIG=<config> -DANCHOR=<target> -DVARIABLE=<name>
#          -P check-error-popups.cmake

# Nothing but `TextCell` itself may build a `CellKind::Text` cell.
#
# `pacectl`'s `Cell` model carries a kind beside its text, and `CellKind::Text`
# means *these bytes are valid UTF-8* -- an invariant every renderer relies on, since
# `--format=json` interpolates `lexical` into a document that must be UTF-8 end to end.
# `TextCell` is where that is established: it asks `IsValidUtf8` and answers with a
# base64 `Binary` cell when the answer is no.
#
# ## Why a scan and not only the folding
#
# Because the folding is not reachable all the way down, and the tree has already paid
# for believing otherwise.
#
# The UTF-8 question used to be asked by a SECOND function, `TextOrBinaryCell`, whose
# doc comment read *"The one place the UTF-8 question is asked, so no command can
# forget to ask it."* That sentence was false as written and its falseness was the
# defect: nothing enforced it. Four sites called it and about twenty-nine called
# `TextCell`, and three of the twenty-nine carried bytes off the wire -- a memcached
# key from a GET reply, `ME`'s key, a meta flag value -- where no caller can assert
# anything about the encoding. A non-UTF-8 KEY therefore rendered as raw bytes and
# `--format=json` produced a document that was not UTF-8
# ([#1356](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/1356)).
#
# The fix folded the question into `TextCell`, which is the stronger half of this
# tree's rule: **a guard folded INTO the operation is self-enforcing; a guard called
# ALONGSIDE one needs a scan.** Moving three call sites to the other function would
# have left the next site free to skip the question again.
#
# What folding does NOT reach is `Cell` being an aggregate. `Cell { .kind =
# CellKind::Text, .lexical = bytes }` compiles anywhere in the binary and asks nothing,
# and no C++ this tree is willing to write forbids it -- the formatters read both
# members, and `AbsentCell` returns `Cell {}`. So that one shape is what the scan
# covers, and it covers only that.
#
# The rulebook's own sentence for the split: reach for the type system when the
# obligation is DO SOMETHING, reach for a scan when it is SAY WHY. This is the first
# kind and the type system does carry it, right up to the aggregate.
#
# ## Reads are not writes
#
# `case CellKind::Text:` in `CliFormat.cpp` and `cell.kind == CellKind::Text` in the
# tests are how the model is CONSUMED, and a check that refused those would refuse the
# renderers it exists to protect. So the violating shape is an assignment or an
# aggregate initialiser, not the token.
#
# The blind spots, stated rather than papered over, because a check whose edges are
# unnamed gets either trusted past them or widened on a guess:
#
#   * the enumerator routed through a variable -- `auto k = CellKind::Text; Cell { k,
#     s };` -- is invisible here. Nothing in this tree does that and the remedy if
#     something ever needs to is to call `TextCell`, not to widen this check.
#   * the token inside a STRING LITERAL reads as code, as in
#     `check-istreambuf-iterator.cmake`, and for the same reason: a literal-aware C++
#     lexer written in `cmake -P` would be a bigger liability than the case it covers.
#
# ## The factory file is DERIVED, never listed
#
# One file is allowed to write the enumerator: the one that defines `TextCell`. That
# file is found by searching for the definition rather than named in a table here.
#
# A hand-kept allowlist would be exact about the files it knows and silent about the
# ones it does not, and silence reads identically to complete coverage
# ([#492](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/492)). Worse for this
# check specifically: a listed path survives the file being MOVED, so the rename that
# relocated the factory would leave the check happily excusing a path that no longer
# exists while refusing the factory's new home -- and the fix a hurried reader reaches
# for is adding the new path to the list, leaving two.
#
# ## Fails closed, in two directions
#
# A scan that finds nothing must not be mistaken for a clean tree, so two things this
# repository definitely contains are required before any verdict is drawn: the factory
# must itself carry one of the write shapes (or the scan cannot recognise the shape at
# all), and the enumerator must be READ somewhere outside the factory (or it has been
# renamed and this scan is blind).
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`: it reads files, compares strings and reports. See
# `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports failure through its
# OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-cli-text-cell.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

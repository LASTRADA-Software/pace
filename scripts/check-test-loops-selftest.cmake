# `test-loops` must be SEEN to refuse each shape it names, and seen to stay QUIET over the
# shapes it does not.
#
# Both arms, or the check is only half-tested. The quiet arm decides whether a check
# survives: this tree's tests hold over a thousand range-for loops and plenty of prose about
# the loops it forbids, and a check that refused those would be deleted rather than obeyed.
#
# ## What the staged tree carries
#
# ADDING AN EXEMPTION ROW TO THE CHECK IS TWO EDITS, AND THIS FILE IS THE SECOND. A row with
# no staged site here is reported STALE -- correctly -- which turns every baseline case red at
# once, so the failure names this file rather than the row. Stage a file carrying that row's
# site, add it to `files`/`texts` (positional, so both), and move the exempted-site tally in the
# two baseline rows. Measured: missed twice in one session, both times by whoever added the row.
#
# One file per scope row, and one file per exemption row carrying the site that row exempts
# -- so every case also proves the exemption rows still match what they claim to, and a case
# that removes one of those sites proves STALE is refused. The mode (git or directory walk)
# is part of the output and asserted on both sides, because a synthetic tree is not a git
# repository and a fixture that only ever exercised the walk would be testing the mode CI
# does not use.
#
# ## Line numbers are asserted, not just filenames
#
# `;`, `[`, `]` and `\` are CMake list structure and C++ is full of them. One case plants all
# of them ABOVE a violation and asserts the exact `file:line`, because an assertion on the
# filename alone passes under a reader that merges lines.
#
# The mutations are applied to a SYNTHESISED tree, never to the tree under test. Each case
# asserts its mutation actually LANDED before any verdict is drawn from it.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-test-loops-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

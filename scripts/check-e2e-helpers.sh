# The self-test for `scripts/lib/e2e-common.sh`.
#
# A shared helper is a shared fake. `src/tests/ScriptedSocket.hpp` is the
# precedent: three private copies of one scripted socket, two of them carrying
# the same defect, found a day apart -- because a fake nobody exercises does not
# report its own bugs. Folding seven copies of `free_port`/`wait_for_port`/
# `http_get`/`fail` into one file makes every fixture depend on this file being
# right, and a helper library with no test that can go red is #449's own failure
# mode one level up: something that passes for a reason unrelated to what it
# guards.
#
# Two halves, and the split is the one `.agent/rules/testing.md` argues for after
# `node-scratch-isolation-e2e` spent a CI leg learning it:
#
#   * The DECISION -- which kind of failure a wait suffered -- is `_e2e_verdict`,
#     which is pure. It reads no clock, touches no process and opens no file, so
#     every one of its branches is a one-line record here, including the ones that
#     cannot be staged (a pid that is not this shell's child) and the ones whose
#     bounds have to be pinned on BOTH sides rather than demonstrated once from
#     the middle. That is where an `-and`/`-or` mistake actually lives.
#   * ACQUISITION -- the poll loop, the liveness check, the log-growth accounting
#     -- is driven for real, with real processes that really die and real logs
#     that really grow, but with one-second budgets rather than a fixture's.
#
# Registered as `e2e-helpers-selftest` and deliberately NOT labelled `smoke`: it
# starts no daemon, needs no compiler, and finishes in a few seconds, so it
# belongs in the default `ctest` set where a change to the helpers is caught by
# whoever made it.
#
# Usage:
#   check-e2e-helpers.sh                   run every case
#   check-e2e-helpers.sh --case NAME       run one case and REPORT on it:
#                                          0 clean, 3 the case printed BUG:,
#                                          anything else the case aborted
#   check-e2e-helpers.sh --case-body NAME  the inner half, whose status answers
#                                          only *did this case run*. Used by
#                                          `--case`; not the mode to re-run by
#                                          hand, because its verdict is the
#                                          OUTPUT and nothing reads it for you.

# word "twenty" retyped in three comments and two messages. The ceiling below is
# `FastPathCommands` x `_e2e_poll_pause` (0.2s) at twenty; halving the count
# halves the separation and NOTHING goes red -- the staged flat-pause defect
# would then cost ~2.05s, still over a 2000ms ceiling, so `bounded-fast-path-bites`
# still passes while the gap it certifies has collapsed from 4058-vs-927 to
# ~2050-vs-500. The figure the two cases PRINT is this variable for the same
# reason: prose reading "twenty" beside a loop of ten is a check reporting on
# work it did not do.
FastPathCommands=20

# What `FastPathCommands` immediate commands may cost before `run_bounded` is
# judged to be sleeping through them. Shared by the two cases that measure it: the
# healthy one asserts UNDER this, the staged-defect one asserts OVER it, so the
# number cannot drift into meaning nothing without one of the two failing.
FastPathCeilingMs=2000

# What the STAGED defect must measure PER PAUSE for the ceiling above to be said
# to separate anything.
#
# PER PAUSE and not in total (#1196). The total is not a property of
# `run_bounded` alone: its loop polls only while the command is still alive, so a
# command that finishes before its first poll asks for no pause at all, and under
# load the PARENT is descheduled long enough for that to happen. Measured on one
# box, 2026-09-10, WSL2 / Ubuntu-24.04 / 32 CPUs: 20 pauses of 20 commands on
# nine runs of ten and 18 on the tenth. On a hosted `Linux-gcc-release` runner,
# 15 -- and 15 x 200ms is EXACTLY the 3000ms the old total floor demanded, which
# a `-le` then refused, reddening master on a tree nobody had touched.
#
# So the previous fix's premise was false exactly where it was most confident:
# *"twenty `sleep 0.2` calls were requested and performed every time -- counted"*
# is true of an idle host and of no other. Moving the verdict off the wall clock
# was right; moving it onto a quantity the host still decides was the half nobody
# re-derived. **Dividing by the count cancels the host out** and keeps every
# argument below intact, because the count is the only part the host touches.
#
# `bounded-fast-path-bites` used to assert only that the defect came in OVER the
# ceiling, and "over" is not "separated": at ten commands the flat-pause defect
# is 2050ms against a 2000ms ceiling, a 2.5% margin on an instrument whose
# HEALTHY end has been measured spread over 700ms. That case would have passed
# and certified nothing. The floor is 1.5x the ceiling, which the real defect
# clears by construction -- twenty `sleep`s of `_e2e_poll_pause` cannot come back
# in under 4000ms, and the best defective reading on the host in the table below
# was 4058ms, so 3000ms leaves 35% headroom at the tight end and every reading
# above it is further away.
#
# DERIVED from the ceiling rather than written out as 3000, because the sentence
# above is the whole point of the constant and a literal states it in prose while
# implementing nothing. Written out, the two numbers are independent: raising
# `FastPathCeilingMs` past the defect -- which is precisely the way this ceiling
# stops separating -- leaves the floor at 3000, the staged defect still clears it,
# and `bounded-fast-path-bites` goes on passing while certifying a ceiling that
# has stopped meaning anything. Measured, staging exactly that: with the floor
# written out, a ceiling of 10000ms was caught by nothing.
# The ceiling's share of ONE pause, times the same 1.5. Both hollowings-out the
# paragraphs above describe are still caught, and now for a reason no host can
# move: a ceiling raised to 10000ms puts this floor at 750ms against a defective
# pause of 200, and halving `FastPathCommands` puts it at 300 against the same
# 200. Integer division, so it is exact at these values (6000/40).
FastPathDefectFloorMsPerPause=$(( (FastPathCeilingMs * 3) / (FastPathCommands * 2) ))

# What a HEALTHY run may ask for before the ceiling above has stopped separating
# anything.
#
# `bounded-fast-path-bites` re-derives the DEFECT end on the machine that is
# running -- it stages the defect and asserts it clears the floor. Nothing re-derived
# the HEALTHY end: the case asserted only *healthy <= ceiling*, never that healthy sat
# FAR below it. The requested totals are quantised at 200 / 400 / 800 / 1800 / 3800 ms
# for twenty commands when every command consumes the same number of poll ticks, so
# **1800 ms was a legal passing verdict** -- nine times healthy, four ticks per command
# against one. A regression producing it passed this case AND `-bites`, which stages a
# FLAT pause and is therefore anchored at 4000 ms whatever the host does. Both guards
# green, separation collapsed from 20x to 2.2x, and no `SLOW:` line because the wall
# clock never moved. That is the ceiling's own defect at the other end: the floor's
# comment above argues that "over" is not "separated", and this end never got the
# same treatment.
#
# **The number is defensible because of the MARGIN, not because of the symmetry.**
# `ceiling * 2/3` mirrors the floor's `ceiling * 3/2`, which is tidy and is still one
# number justified by another number. What defends it is the size of the gap in the
# quantity that actually varies -- `f`, the fraction of commands consuming four ticks
# rather than one, where the total is `200 + 1600f`:
#
#     healthy, best                       200 ms     f = 0%
#     healthy, worst measured at load 34-62   230 ms     f = 1.9%
#     this bound                         1333 ms     f = 70.8%
#     the regression that must fail      1800 ms     f = 100%
#
# **A 38-fold margin.** To trip this a host would need seven commands in ten to
# survive four polls, against under two in a hundred at a load average of 62 on 32
# cores. That is not a slow host; that is the regression. The general worry -- that a
# threshold at the healthy end reintroduces the host sensitivity this case exists to
# remove -- is sound and does not bite at this magnitude, which is a figure rather
# than a hope.
#
# It admits 800 ms, four times healthy and a real regression that will go unnoticed
# here. Left deliberately: this bounds the SEPARATION collapsing, not every regression,
# and widening it is how a derived bound turns back into a tuned one.
FastPathHealthyMaxMs=$(( FastPathCeilingMs * 2 / 3 ))

# What `run_bounded` costs per call when nothing is wrong, which is what makes the
# `SLOW:` reading a NUMBER rather than an adjective.
#
# A CONSTANT and not a literal inside the message: the paragraph at the ceiling
# case says the baseline must live in one place, and the version of that message
# spelled `4-5ms` in the `echo` anyway -- restating it in exactly the way the
# comment beside it forbade, and drifting the moment the helper changed.
#
# A QUANTITY UNDER CONDITIONS, and both halves travel:
#
#   * pre-#1077, 32-core Linux, lightly loaded: 284-303ms for twenty commands
#     against 200ms requested, so about 4-5ms per call.
#   * #1077 arms the deadline INSIDE the poll loop, which is one extra fork per
#     call. Measured as a PAIRED step and not as two independent readings, the
#     two trees alternated within each pair so load drift cannot masquerade as
#     the difference: +2ms per call, 7 of 8 pairs positive, N=8, load ~26.
#   * ANOTHER MACHINE, same tree, minutes apart, reported by another lane rather
#     than measured here: WSL2 reads **5.5ms** per call and Git Bash **128ms** --
#     a 23x spread on one box, with the requested total at 200ms in BOTH. WSL2's
#     5.5ms lands inside this range and is the first independent check the figure
#     has had; it had rested on one machine.
#
#     That row is here for the reader rather than for the number. Somebody on Git
#     Bash meeting `128ms per call against a 6-7ms baseline` in the `SLOW:` line
#     below has nothing telling them it is their SHELL and not a broken host --
#     the MSYS fork path, on hardware that is otherwise ordinary.
#
# The figure below is DERIVED from that step rather than re-measured on an idle
# host, which is said out loud because it is the weaker of the two claims and a
# reader has no way to recover the difference afterwards.
#
# It is also the ceiling case's own comment coming true on a real change instead
# of as an argument: that paragraph says a change adding one fork per call
# "arrives here as a breach and reads exactly like a slow host", and #1077 then
# added exactly that fork. A STEP in this figure is the helper; a proportional
# rise across the whole run is the host.

# `lib/e2e-common.sh` REFUSES this same construct and is right to (#851): a
# `0,243` reaching `$(( 10# ... ))` is a wrong SMALL number rather than an error,

    #
    # In THIS file and not in `lib/e2e-common.sh`, which would be the tidier home.
    # That library is another lane's subject right now (#1048, #1066), and a check
    # does not reach into a file it does not own to install the instrument it
    # needs. It is also the more honest coupling: the property under test is
    # `run_bounded`'s pacing, so the meter belongs to the test.
    #
    # It fails CLOSED if `run_bounded` ever stops spelling its pause `sleep` -- a
    # `command sleep`, a `/bin/sleep`, a background timer -- because the ledger
    # then reads zero and the positive control in the case below refuses BY NAME
    # rather than reporting a very fast bound.
    #
    # It records ONLY the pauses this measurement's own flow performs. A pause the
    # poll loop waits on is spent by `run_bounded`; a background timer's `sleep` is
    # a marker running CONCURRENTLY and is not time the helper spends between
    # polls, so counting it would be counting the wrong quantity.
    #
    # Not hypothetical: #1066, landed as #1077, gives `run_bounded` a real deadline
    # as a backgrounded `( ...; sleep "$seconds"; ... ) &`, so on the merged tree
    # twenty calls of `run_bounded 5 true` added 20 x 5 s and the meter read

    # The scratch directory AND the processes this case started. It was
    # `rm -rf "$scratch"` alone, which reaped nothing at all: `_selftest_listener`
    # below is an unbounded `accept()` loop, so every case that backgrounded one
    # stranded an immortal `perl` holding a 127.0.0.1 LISTEN socket for the life
    # of the machine. Measured on one dev host before this fix: 1368 orphans
    # holding 1444 loopback sockets, the oldest 30.5 hours old, and three more
    # from every `ctest -R e2e-helpers-selftest` (#839).
    #
    # The load is the visible half and the cheap half. The PORTS are the
    # expensive one. `free_port` draws by asking whether anything is listening,
    # so a held LISTEN socket is precisely what its probe refuses -- in growing
    # numbers, forever, on a machine several lanes share. The failure that
    # produces surfaces in whatever OTHER fixture next draws a port, which is the
    # worst shape available: nothing points back here. Two lanes had already
    # misread it, one as CPU contention and one as an unreproducible flake.
    #
    # `jobs -pr`, and not a pid ledger the call sites append to -- for the reason
    # `note_failure` below is a function rather than a convention. A ledger is
    # per-site, so the next background site reopens this by forgetting one line,
    # and #834 was already writing that site while this was being fixed. There is
    # nothing here to forget: every still-RUNNING background job of this shell is
    # reaped, whatever started it, on whichever path the case left by -- the path
    # the ticket names, `wait_for_port` calling `fail` before its `kill`,
    # included. That the trap runs on the `fail` paths at all is not assumed:
    # the three `fail-*` rows in the table below already assert `cleanup ran`.
    #
    # This is worth nothing without the `exec` on each helper below. `$!` for a
    # backgrounded FUNCTION is the subshell bash forks to run it, not the program
    # that subshell then runs, so reaping the job pid killed the wrapper and left
    # the `perl` -- which is also why the three `kill "$listener"` calls already
    # in this file never worked. Both halves or neither.
    #
    # `-r` rather than a bare `-p`. Bash reaps a finished job internally while
    # keeping it in the jobs table, so a finished job pid is free to have been
    # recycled and signalling it would hit a process belonging to somebody else
    # -- the `pgrep -f` misattribution lesson arriving through another door. Only
    # a RUNNING job is still ours to signal.
    #
    # Not `kill 0`: a case runs as `bash "$0" --case NAME` from a command
    # substitution in the driver, with no job control, so it shares the DRIVER
    # process group and `kill 0` would take the whole run down with it.
    #
    # It signals and does NOT wait, which is deliberate and is the one thing a
    # reader is likely to want to "fix". `stop_and_require_exit` in the library
    # is the richer recipe (TERM, poll, KILL, wait) and is wrong in a trap twice
    # over: it ends in `fail`, which does `kill -TERM $_e2e_top_pid; exit 1`
    # re-entrantly inside the EXIT trap already firing, and a bare `wait` here
    # would be an UNBOUNDED wait inside cleanup -- `bounded-outlasts-a-trapped-term`
    # below stages a child that ignores TERM on purpose, which is exactly the
    # process such a wait would hang on. Escalation is unnecessary for the same
    # reason it would be needed: these helpers install no TERM handler, and the
    # `alarm` below is the backstop for anything that outlives the signal.

    # and the stall age crosses `recent`, the verdict flips to *stalled*, and the
    # assertion fails on a perfectly healthy writer. Observed exactly once, as
    # `output lacks 'still making progress'`, then 3/3 alone and green on the next
    # full gate.

    # THE MARGIN IS PINNED HERE, not derived from the code beside it, and that is

    # ASan -- and a figure that TRACKS its source silently re-attributes a real
    # reading to conditions it was never taken under. If `recent` or the writer's
    # period changes, this paragraph is wrong and should be re-measured rather than
    # updated to match.

    # moment the wait gives up, so a tighter writing loop does not help: a subshell
    # descheduled for longer than `recent` is descheduled however often it intended
    # to write. And widening the bound makes `recent` LARGER, so the case would pass
    # by testing less -- which is what #354 refuses.

    # --- `wait_for_node_ready` waits past the BIND ---------------------------
    #
    # #634. Since #365 a node binds FIRST and logs `compile node ready`
    # afterwards, so `wait_for_port` returning is strictly weaker than "the node
    # is serving". What had been covering that was an ACCIDENT: the old
    # per-fixture helper probed before the node had bound, so its first probe
    # always failed and it always slept 200 ms. `wait_until` does its setup before
    # probing and does not oversleep, so on a run where the port answers on the
    # first probe there is no sleep at all and the caller's next statement runs
    # inside the window.
    #
    # BOTH directions, because neither half means anything alone -- and here they
    # catch a loosened helper by DIFFERENT mechanisms, which is the reason to keep
    # both rather than a symmetry for its own sake. Measured against a
    # `wait_for_node_ready` written as `wait_for_port "$@"`:
    #
    #   * this case still EXITS 0 under that bug, so the status cannot see it. It
    #     is caught only by the assertion that the marker is PRESENT when the wait
    #     returns -- which is why the case reads the log rather than reporting
    #     that the wait came back.
    #   * `refuses-bound-only` below is caught by the status and not by any
    #     output.
    #
    # Each alone passes the broken helper. The pair does not.
    #
    # WHAT PINS THE MARKER, precisely, because the obvious sentence here would be
    # wrong. These two cases stage ONE text, present against absent -- unlike
    # `registration-accepted` above, which stages `1 of 1` against `0 of 1` and so
    # catches a wait that matched the wrong line. A second spelling of the text
    # would not weaken this pair.
    #
    # So the constant is pinned by having READERS, not by being unspoken: the
    # assertion below matches `$E2eNodeReadyMarker` itself, and
    # `refuses-bound-only`'s table row requires the expiry message `wait_for_log`
    # builds FROM it. Reword the line in the library and both fail.
    #
    # `_selftest_node` spells the text literally and is not a third reader -- it is
    # staging what a real node writes, which is the same thing
    # `registration-accepted` does with its log line. Staging the product's output

# A stand-in for an admin endpoint serving `/metrics`, in one of three shapes.
#
# `_selftest_listener` above cannot stage any of them: it answers one fixed JSON
# body, so every scrape reads the same thing and neither the rising case nor the
# absent-series case exists. The three modes are `wait_for_counter`'s three
# terminal states seen from the other side of the socket:
#
#   rise    the series starts at 0 and reaches 1 from the second request on, so
#           the wait RETURNS and hands back a reading
#   flat    the series is there and never moves, so the wait expires knowing the
#           last reading
#   absent  the body carries a different series, so the wait expires knowing the
#           scrape was answered and this counter is not exported
#
# The fourth state -- nothing ever answered -- needs no listener at all and is
# staged by drawing a port and not binding it, which is why that case is in the
# plain table rather than here.
#
# The body's lines end with `\n` and the headers with `\r\n`, because that is what
# a real exporter writes and `metric_value` anchors its expression on `$`: a body
# with CRLF line endings would match nothing, and a stand-in that used them would
# make every case here fail for a reason having nothing to do with the wait.
#
# It APPENDS a line to the log per request served, so the expiring cases exercise
# a log that grows -- which is what makes their output show a general verdict
# saying the process was making progress beside a COUNTER finding saying what
# actually went wrong. A stand-in that logged nothing would collapse the two.
#
# `exec` and the lifetime bound come from `e2e_bounded_perl`. This is the
# FOURTH stand-in and the one that made #1214 a ticket rather than a tidy-up: it
# was added by a branch in flight while the door was being written on another, so
# it spelled the pair by hand and nothing but a scan could have said so. That the
# collision announced itself here -- `perl-bounds-scan` refusing this line by name
# at the rebase -- is the intended failure and is why the scan walks rather than

# The driver

# `--case-body NAME` is the INNER half: it runs one case and its status answers
# only *did this case run* -- non-zero when the case aborted (a `fail`, or the
# `set -e` inside `run_case` firing), zero when it reached the end. That question
# is a real one and the five internal consumers below have always read it
# correctly, which is why the bare `exit 0` survived so long.
#
# It is not, however, the question somebody re-running a case is asking. The
# failure block at the bottom of this file prints
#
#     re-run one alone with: bash check-e2e-helpers.sh --case <name>
#
# and sends an investigator to a mode whose status could not say whether the case
# found a defect: a run printing `BUG: the bound is sleeping through commands that
# have already finished` exited 0, exactly as a healthy run did. A lane followed
# that advice, built a harness on the status, and reported 6 of 6 PASS including a
# run that should have failed -- nothing errored, the output was well-formed, and
# the status was simply not a verdict (#1104).
#
# So `--case` WRAPS it and applies the SAME rule the driver applies: the absence of
# `BUG:` from the case's output. One rule, one text, two readers -- rather than a
# marker beside the printing, which would be a second mechanism free to disagree
# with the first.
#
# THREE outcomes, not two, because *aborted* and *ran and reported a defect* are
# different diagnoses fixed in different places:
#
#     0  the case ran and printed no BUG:
#     3  the case ran to completion and reported a defect
#     *  whatever the case exited with -- it aborted, and did not reach the end
#
# An inner PROCESS rather than a redirection: `fail` sends SIGTERM to
# `_e2e_top_pid`, which `e2e_begin` sets to `$$` -- so the case must own that pid,
# or a `fail` would kill the wrapper mid-read and take the output with it. A
# `tee` keeps the case streaming live, which matters because several cases are
# about waits and hangs. Its cost is one extra process per case.
#
# The two streams are MERGED here, as all five consumers already merge them with
# their own `2>&1`, so a `BUG:` on either is seen and the ordering a consumer
# captures is the ordering of one stream rather than a race between two.

# The cases were run one after another, and they are mostly WAITS -- a staged
# timeout, a budget of one or two seconds, a listener that answers late -- so the
# serial loop spent most of this test's time asleep: the cases summed to about two
# minutes alone on a WSL host, against a 120 s ctest TIMEOUT the whole test has to
# fit in (the conditions are in the filemacro lane's Job 3 report). Every case is
# its own `bash --case` process with its own scratch directory, port ledger and job
# table, so running them side by side changes nothing a case can see -- except the
# PORTS, which a per-run ledger cannot keep apart: two lanes drew one number, one bound
# it, and the other's `node-ready-refuses-unbound` found a listener nobody had staged
# (Linux arm64, round 6). So each lane draws from its OWN slice of the range
# (`E2E_PORT_RANGE`, `e2e_port_slice`), numbered across EVERY table in `CaseLaneTables`:
# the shell and the socket tables run at once, and numbering each from zero gave lane k
# of both one slice. `lane-slices-disjoint` asserts that across the lanes actually
# started, and `port-range-of-this-lane` that a case sees its lane's.
#
# `start_case_lanes` deals the records round-robin into `CaseLanes` lanes; each lane
# runs its cases one after another in the background, while the scans below go on
# in the foreground. `judge_case_lanes` waits for exactly those lanes and only then
# judges: `expect` and `note_failure` run here, in the parent, in the order of the
# table -- so the counters, the failure names and the order of the `FAIL` lines are
# what the serial loop produced. A case whose lane recorded no status never reached
# a verdict, and is a failure by name rather than a silent gap.
#
# Lanes rather than a job pool because bash 3.2 has no `wait -n`. Each lane clears
# the traps it inherited before it does anything else. `CaseLanes` is set at the top.

# `_e2e_verdict` takes a record and returns lines. Every branch is one row here,
# and each threshold is pinned on BOTH sides rather than demonstrated once from
# the middle -- at the boundary and one second past it -- because that is where a
# comparison mistake lives. Arguments are:
#
#     what  bound  elapsed  polls  alive  exit  logGrew  stall  requestedMs
#
# all durations in MEASURED seconds except the last, which is the total the loop
# ASKED FOR in milliseconds and is the one figure here that consults no clock
# (#1066). With bound=20 the "recent" window is 20/4 = 5s, so a 5s stall is
# progressing and a 6s one is stalled; and the starvation note fires BELOW
# bound x 500 ms, so 10000 is quiet and 9999 is not.
#
# Every row states the last field even where it is irrelevant, rather than letting
# it default: a row that omits a field is one nobody can read the intent of, and
# `-` here is a THIRD state -- the caller took no such reading -- which gets its own
# row rather than being the shape every other row happens to have.

# --- the drain's verdict, against staged readings ---------------------------
#
# `_e2e_read_ended_at_bound` decides whether OUR bound or the PEER ended a read. It
# is driven DIRECTLY here rather than through a staged listener because half of it
# cannot be exhibited on this platform at all: bash 3.2, which macOS ships as
# `/bin/bash`, answers a plain `1` for both a timeout and EOF, so the status arm is
# unreachable there and the probe arm is unreachable on bash 4+.
# `.agent/rules/testing.md`, on splitting the decision out as a pure function over a
# record so a verdict needing a rare machine to reproduce needs one line here.
#
# **These rows no longer carry an elapsed time, and that is #1048.** The predicate
# used to read `elapsed >= bound`, timed with `SECONDS` -- which is `CLOCK_REALTIME`,
# and the host steps it. Measured against `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, 7 of 45 reads reported a
# `SECONDS` elapsed of 4 while the monotonic clock measured 5.01-5.06 s: full-bound
# timeouts carrying status 142, which only LOOKED short. `4 >= 5` was false, so a
# server that held perfectly was reported as having closed. 9 failures in 60 probes
# against one settled node.
#
# The two staged readings are the read's exit status and whether the follow-up probe
# BLOCKED -- 1 it did, 0 it came back at once, `-` no probe was taken because the peer
# had already spoken. Neither is a clock reading, which is the whole repair.
#
# The listener-backed arm of the same property is `http-silence-inconclusive`, which
# spends the whole bound. These cost nothing and cover both branches on every
# platform, which that case cannot.
# Whether the probe is TAKEN at all is a second decision, and it had a second bug.
#
# The gate read `[ "$status" -le 128 ] && [ -z "$body" ]`, so a PARTIAL body skipped
# the probe entirely -- and on bash 3.2, where the status cannot decide, the drain
# then answered `peer`: *the server answered*, for a response our own bound had cut
# short (#1257). The body is not a reading about who ended the read.
#
# ## What this table CANNOT reach, stated rather than left to look covered
#
# The defect is invisible on bash 4+, where a timeout carries 142 and the status
# decides before the gate's second clause matters. It is reproducible only on a real
# bash 3.2, and there was none available here -- Docker Desktop's daemon is not
# running on this host and WSL has no podman, so `podman run docker.io/library/bash:3.2`
# was NOT run and this arm has NOT been exercised end to end.
#
# What IS covered on every platform is the predicate, below, plus the shape scan
# further down that refuses a second clause returning to the call site. Neither is
# the live 3.2 case, and neither is claimed to be.

# `CLOCK_REALTIME`, and this host steps it. Three arms, because no one of them can
# carry the property on its own:
#
#   1. the deleted rule, driven over STAGED clock traces, shown answering wrongly
#      in BOTH directions. Staged rather than waited for: a backward step happens
#      about once in fourteen reads here and a forward one has never been observed
#      at all, so a test that waits for one is a test that usually does not run.
#   2. the replacement primitive, exercised for real, reading no clock.
#   3. a DERIVED scan over the library, so a fourth bound cannot arrive on
#      `SECONDS` by omission.
#
# The deleted rule is spelled out here as a negative control. That is a copy of
# code that no longer exists, which is normally the defect this file has rules
# about -- but a check that only drives the SURVIVING rule cannot show that the
# rule was changed for a reason, and `testing.md` asks for the asymmetry rather
# than for a green run.

# waited -- which is exactly the gap the defect lives in. Replacing the clock
# with `elapsed=$(( elapsed + 1 ))` leaves all forty other checks green.
#
# A four-second bound, required to have taken at least three seconds -- and the
# three seconds are counted MONOTONICALLY, which is the whole of this change.
#
# `SECONDS` is `CLOCK_REALTIME`, which a VM guest's host time sync steps. Measured
# on this host: backwards by ~2.03 s, periodically, so ~12% of any 4 s window
# contains one (#1108). This floor's slack measured 1.10-1.41 s over ten runs of
# this very case, so EVERY step observed exceeds EVERY slack observed -- the floor
# is crossed whenever a step lands in the window, and the case then prints
# `the loop is counting iterations rather than reading a clock`: a confidently
# worded FALSE cause, naming the subject as broken when the meter moved.
#
# The reason this row used to carry -- "load pushes a wait AWAY from the
# threshold" -- is true of load and silent about the step, which is
# load-INDEPENDENT (#1108 refutes load across a twentyfold excursion). A reason
# that argues the wrong variable is worse than none, because it reads as
# considered. The old "1s slack for truncation" argument was sound about
# truncation and was never about a step.
#
# The remedy is a co-timer, not a wider margin: a background `sleep` counts down
# on `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` and cannot be stepped, so arming N seconds before the
# child and asking afterwards whether it fired answers "did at least N seconds
# pass" with no clock read at all. #354 refuses a bigger margin, and no margin
# can outrun a step whose magnitude is not a constant.
#
# NOT `_e2e_deadline_arm`, though it is the same mechanism. Two reasons, and the
# second is load bearing:
#
#   * the library is not sourced at this file's top level -- every case runs it
#     in a subshell, and the one `. lib/e2e-common.sh` further down is staged
#     heredoc content -- so the function is out of scope and `_e2e_workdir` unset;
#   * this measurement exists precisely to time the library from OUTSIDE, the one
#     reading it cannot take about itself. Borrowing the library's own timer would
#     make the meter part of the subject.
#
# `/proc/uptime` is not the answer either: it occurs in this tree only inside
# comments, and macOS -- where this file runs, on bash 3.2 -- does not have it.

# --- `run_bounded`'s ceiling is a ceiling ----------------------------------
#
# Timed from OUTSIDE, for the reason the block above gives, and pinned on BOTH
# sides. Only the upper bound has teeth here and it is the whole point: the child
# ignores TERM and would sleep for 30 s, so a helper that waits for it to die
# politely -- or that never escalates to KILL -- takes 30 s and passes every
# assertion inside the case. The lower bound is there so a helper that returned
# 124 immediately, without running the command at all, cannot pass either.
# BOTH bounds are monotonic, and the floor is why. Its slack was argued as a
# "3-4x margin" -- which is the CEILING's margin; the row was silent about the
# floor of 1, the direction nobody re-reads. Re-measured on this host through the
# shell that actually steps: this case runs 3.08-3.33 s, so the floor's slack is
# 2.08-2.33 s against a step observed as large as 2.09 s. Those overlap, so the
# floor is defeatable too -- rarely, needing a large step to meet a fast run, and
# rare is not safe. The earlier 3.875 s reading was taken under Git Bash, which
# does not step; measuring a margin through the one shell without the defect is

# --- `run_bounded` is not slower than what it bounds ------------------------
#
# The bound's cadence. The measurement, not the constant, is what this pins -- a
# future pause raised "just a little" is exactly how the 74 healthy probes became
# twenty seconds of sleeping.
#
# The clock is INSIDE the case (#678); the case body carries the reasoning and
# the measured separation. This block is still its own block rather than a row in
# the table above for one reason: the figure has to be printed on the PASSING
# path, which the table loop does not do. The record grammar is
# `name|status|pattern|pattern|...` with variadic trailing patterns, so a "report
# this" column cannot simply be appended -- it needs a grammar change to a loop
# every other row goes through, to serve one row. THE TRIGGER for making that
# change is a SECOND case wanting a figure on the passing path; until then this
# is the cheaper shape, and the defect row below reuses the table as it stands.
#
# THE SURVEY, so the next reader does not re-derive it. Stated in the tense it
# was taken: BEFORE this change the `SECONDS`-delta-over-a-whole-process idiom
# appeared exactly three times in this file. Two of them are still here.
#
#   * `wait-clock-bound`             LOWER bound. Was argued "safe by
#                                    construction -- load pushes a wait AWAY from
#                                    the threshold". That is true of LOAD and
#                                    silent about a clock STEP, which #1108
#                                    measured as load-INDEPENDENT: slack
#                                    1.10-1.41s against a step of 1.98-2.09s, so
#                                    every step exceeds every slack. CONVERTED to
#                                    a monotonic co-timer; the realtime delta is
#                                    printed and compared against nothing.
#   * `bounded-outlasts-a-trapped-term`
#                                    Argued as an UPPER bound with a 3-4x margin,
#                                    which is the ceiling's margin -- the row was
#                                    silent about its floor of 1. Re-measured
#                                    through the shell that steps: 3.08-3.33s, so
#                                    the floor's slack is 2.08-2.33s against a
#                                    step reaching 2.09s. Those OVERLAP. The
#                                    earlier 2.5-3.1s was Git Bash, which does not
#                                    step. CONVERTED, both bounds.
#
# The general finding, which outlives both rows: a margin cannot justify a
# realtime bound here, because the step's magnitude is not a constant and #354
# refuses widening one anyway. Neither row was wrong about the variable it
# named; each was silent about the only one that reaches it.
#   * `bounded-fast-path`            UPPER bound with no margin to spare. The
#                                    only one that had to move, and it is now
#                                    timed inside its own case -- so a reader
#                                    grepping this file today finds two, not
#                                    three, and that is not a survey that has
#                                    gone stale.
#
# Outside this file the idiom exists but never as a tight threshold, so nothing
# else needed the same fix:
#
#   * `tsan-canary-rate.sh`   computes the delta and echoes it. Those are its
#                             only two mentions of `elapsed` -- it reports the
#                             figure and compares it against nothing.
#   * `cluster-e2e.sh`        `SECONDS` bounds waits (`deadline=$(( SECONDS + N ))`)
#                             and `firstNamedAt` feeds diagnostic prose. Neither is
#                             a discriminator, and the BUDGET is now a known
#                             remaining site: #1066 established that a bound read
#                             from `SECONDS` is not a duration, and this file's
#                             scan covers the library rather than the fixtures.
#   * `migrate-storage-e2e.sh`
#                             does NOT use it. Its one `SECONDS` is a comment
#                             about `wait_until`'s bound; the script itself polls
#                             through the shared helper.
#   * `lib/e2e-common.sh`     the library this whole file guards, and the biggest
#                             match count of any of them. Every match is a clock
#                             read INSIDE the loop it bounds rather than a wrapper
#                             around a whole process, which is what this survey was
#                             looking for; listed anyway, because "the file with the
#                             most matches is absent from the survey" is not a thing
#                             a reader should have to re-derive.
#
#                             THE ROW USED TO SAY THIRTEEN AND USED TO CALL THEM
#                             SAFE. #1066 is why it no longer does: the reads that
#                             BOUND a loop have gone, and what is left only REPORTS.
#                             `no bound is decided from SECONDS` below is the check
#                             that keeps it that way, and it carries the live count
#                             so this prose does not have to hold a number that
#                             drifts.
#   * `tsan-gate.sh`, `node-socket-activation-e2e.sh`, `doc-subject-checks.sh`
#                             matched by the WORD and not by the idiom: a comment
#                             about `run_bounded`'s integer `SECONDS`, a
#                             `READY_SECONDS` budget handed to `wait_until`, and a
#                             `..._SECONDS` CMake variable named in prose.
#
# The scan behind those rows is `grep -rn SECONDS scripts/ --include=*.sh`, which
# also matches `deadline=$(( SECONDS + N ))`.
#
# **THAT USED TO BE CALLED THE CORRECT IDIOM HERE, and #1066 is the ticket that
# made it false.** The sentence was "reading a clock rather than timing a process
# from outside", and it was right about the distinction it drew and wrong about the
# conclusion: `SECONDS` is `CLOCK_REALTIME`, so a deadline computed from it
# lengthens on a backward step and shortens on a forward one, and neither is
# distinguishable from what the bound exists to detect. A checker whose own comment
# argues against the change it is checking is a citation for reverting that change,
# which is why this is corrected in the same commit rather than left as a residual.
#
# It also makes the scan this block DECLINED tractable. The objection was that the
# word cannot separate the idiom from the correct one -- but after #1066 there is no
# correct one in the library, so `no bound is decided from SECONDS` below can require
# every remaining read to be a named REPORTED reading and refuse the rest.
#
# State the pattern with the count: the
# two are not distinguishable by grepping for the word, and the pattern matches
# SIX files under `scripts/` where the idiom this block is about lives in one.
# Enumerating three of the six and stopping is the shape this repository already
# has a rule about -- a list is exact about what it names and silent about what it
# does not, and silence reads identically to complete coverage.

# A scan that has never been seen to fire is a scan reporting PASS over a set in which
# nothing could fail -- `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` on `script-check-canary`.
# The negative half is not optional: a pattern that matched EVERYTHING would pass the
# positive half alone, and the two halves fail in opposite directions.
#
# One driver rather than three copies (#642). The three canaries here differed only in
# an extractor, a fixture, a count and two nouns -- which is the copy-pasted-block-that-
# differs-only-in-constants shape AGENT.md calls a defect outright. It had already grown
# from the two the ticket counted to three, which is the argument for lifting it now:
# each copy is a place the next scan's canary can be written slightly weaker, and the
# guard nobody re-reads is the one that matters.
#
# The fixtures stay with their scans. They are the part that is genuinely per-scan, and
# hoisting them would put the staged text a long way from the extractor it is staged for.
#
# FOUR canaries go through it: timeout, early-exit, helper-redefinition and
# seconds-scan. Two do not, and both are decisions rather than omissions -- a canary
# left out silently is the next weak copy, which is the whole argument above:
#
#   * `bash32-canary` asks SEVEN questions, not two. Beyond catch/not-catch it drives the
#     declared-region machinery and the outside-scripts walk, so its shape is not this
#     one and forcing it through would mean parameterising five more behaviours.
#   * `early-exit-scan-canary` keeps a THIRD half of its own for the `pipefail` predicate,
#     which decides whether a file is EXAMINED at all. That is a different question from
#     "does the extractor fire", and it sits beside the driver call rather than inside it.
#

# is the worst possible one: the `timeout` scan's own failure message says "use
# run_bounded from scripts/lib/e2e-common.sh", and it could not read the file
# that DEFINES `run_bounded`. A `timeout 5 ...` added inside `run_bounded` was

#
# `find` and not a glob, because a glob cannot recurse portably and this has to
# work in an exported tarball where there is no git. Scoped to `scripts/`, which
# is a choice and is therefore checked further down rather than assumed.
#
# It walks a SNAPSHOT of `scripts/`, taken once below, rather than the tree. Seven
# scans each read every file several times, one process per read, and where the
# checkout sits on a slow filesystem the OPEN is the cost: the early-exit scan
# alone, over the same 78 files, took 9.8 s on WSL's `/mnt/d` and 0.9 s over an
# ext4 copy (Job 3, measured). The copy is the same bytes, taken before any scan
# runs, and every scan reports by basename, so nothing a scan says changes. The

# --- no script pipes into a consumer that exits EARLY, under pipefail -------
#
# `grep -q` exits at its FIRST match. The producer is then writing into a closed
# pipe, takes SIGPIPE, and under `pipefail` the pipeline reports the PRODUCER's
# status -- so the test fails on the SUCCESS path, and only when the producer is
# still writing when grep leaves. Output size decides that, which is why it passes
# on a developer's machine and reddens a runner (#970).
#
# THE CONSUMER IS NOT THE POINT; LEAVING EARLY IS. `head -N` returns after N lines
# for the identical reason, and so do `grep -m N` and a `sed` script carrying `q`.
# #970 closed a SPELLING and this scan then enumerated ONE consumer, so it was
# exact about `grep -q` and silent about every other one -- which is the same
# a-list-is-silent-about-what-it-does-not-name shape the scan exists to replace.
# `check-script-modes.sh` exited **141** under MSYS2 bash, deterministically and
# with no output at all, on `mode=$(printf '%s\n' "$out" | head -1)`, and this scan
# read the file clean (#1111).
#
# Measured, 200 runs per size, `printf '%s\n' "$big" | head -1` under
# `set -uo pipefail` (#1181): **0 of 200** nonzero at 13,892 bytes and **200 of
# 200** at 211,893 bytes. The boundary is the 64 KB pipe buffer -- while the whole
# payload fits, the producer's `write()` completes before the consumer leaves and
# nothing happens. That is the same size dependence the rulebook already records
# for `grep -q` (wrong 20 of 20 at 101 KB, right 20 of 20 at 1.1 KB), and it is
# why a small fixture reports the idiom working and a census by eye is not enough.
#
# `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` has carried this rule since the TSan gate's
# `nm "$b" | grep -q __tsan_init`, and five scripts here carry a comment explaining
# why they do NOT do it. It came back in ten files anyway -- which is #627's lesson
# exactly: a rule stated in the files that obey it never reaches the file that does
# not. So it is a scan.
#
# The remedy is a HERESTRING (`grep -q P <<< "$text"`, `head -1 <<< "$text"`) when
# the producer is a variable -- no pipe, so no SIGPIPE -- or capture-then-match when
# it is a command. For a FIRST LINE specifically, `${text%%$'\n'*}` is pure bash,
# forks nothing at all and cannot SIGPIPE by construction.

# A pipe into a consumer that can leave before its producer is finished writing.
# Four spellings, one grep each, merged and deduplicated by line number:
#
#   `| head`      -- `head -1`, `head -n 1`, `head -c 128`, and a bare `head`
#   `| grep -*q`  -- any bundling: `-q`, `-qi`, `-qx`, `-qFf`, `-Fq`
#   `| grep -*m N`-- leaves after N matches
#   `| sed ... q` -- a `q`/`Q` COMMAND, addressed or not
#
# Four greps rather than one ERE: a single alternation over all four would be
# unreadable and could carry no comment per shape, and the `sed` one needs a
# different quoting style from the rest. They are `sort`ed and made unique on the
# LINE NUMBER, because one line may match two of them and would otherwise be
# reported and counted twice.
#
# The bundled grep forms are not decoration -- the hand census that opened #970
# spelled the pattern `| grep -q` and was blind to the five `grep -Fxq` sites in
# `check-gated-jobs.sh` and `check-merge-queue-contexts.sh`, which is to say to the
# two checks that decide which contexts are REQUIRED. This scan found them.
#
# `head` reading a FILE is not this defect and is deliberately not matched: there
# is no pipe, so there is nothing to SIGPIPE, and `check-script-modes.sh`'s own
# `first=$(head -1 "$root/$path")` is correct as it stands. The `|` is required.
#
# The `sed` pattern demands that the `q` be a COMMAND -- preceded by the start of
# the script, an address, a `;`, a `{` or a `/`, and followed by a quote, a `;`, a
# `}`, a `)`, whitespace or end of line. `sed 's/q//'` and `sed -n 's/.*q\(.*\)/\1/p'`
# therefore do not match, which was checked in both directions against the 125
# `| sed` lines in this tree before the pattern was adopted (all clean).
#
# Comment lines are stripped first -- a COMMENT is not a call site, and two checks
# in this tree have already matched their own headers.
#
# What it does NOT do, stated rather than left to be discovered: it cannot see that
# a `| grep -q` inside a double-quoted STRING runs nothing. The `timeout` scan
# solves its version of that by demanding command position; there is no equivalent
# here, because the defect's own shape IS a pipe. Such a line would have to be
# reworded or the file exempted with a reason. None exists today. Nor can it read a
# `sed` script whose own delimiter is `|`, which ends the scan of the argument at
# the delimiter; none exists today either.

# --- no external filter reads a process substitution ------------------------
#
# `grep PATTERN < <(printf ...)` can make the FILTER the parent of the substitution's writer, and
# on a GitHub Windows runner a grep fed that way came back with exit 148, 128 + 20, and 20 is
# SIGCHLD in the MSYS2 runtime (#1630, round 10). Round 8 was a status-2 refusal from the same
# kind of grep whose status was never printed, read as a kill but not measured as one. That the
# writer's exit is what killed it is INFERRED (it did not reproduce locally). The parentage is
# MEASURED, each writer reading its own PPID out of /proc on Git Bash 5.2.37 and bash 3.2.57: the
# filter is the writer's parent for `cmd < <(w)` and `$(cmd < <(w))`, and for an ARGUMENT
# `cmd <(w)` inside `$( )` or a pipeline -- the `diff <(a) <(b) | sed` and `$(comm -23 <(a) <(b))`
# this tree had. A top-level `cmd <(w)` measured a sibling, and `done < <(cmd <(w))` a parent on
# 5.2 and a sibling on 3.2: whether a line is safe depends on a construct around it and on the
# bash version, neither of which a line shows. So the rule is the one a line CAN show -- no
# external filter reads a process substitution, in either position -- and the remedy is a pipe,
# whose writer is the shell's child in every context measured: `pipe_lines_into` for one input,
# `pipe_pair_into` for two (scripts/lib/third-party-roots.sh). A `while read ...; done < <(...)`,
# `mapfile` or a shell function is the SHELL reading, and is not matched; nor is a filter named
# inside a string, since the command must be in COMMAND position.
#
# The arguments between the filter and its `<(` are read QUOTE-AWARE: a `|`, `;` or `&` inside a
# quoted argument -- `grep -E 'a|b'`, an awk program's `;` -- does not end the command, and `2>&1`
# is a redirection rather than a separator. And the prefixes a command may carry are allowed in
# front of the filter: `VAR=value`, `timeout N`, `nice [-n N]`, `stdbuf -oL`, `time [-p]`,
# `command`, `env`, and a backtick substitution (the wrappers after round 11's review, M3).
# The first version stopped at the first `|`, `;` or `&` anywhere, quotes included, and missed
# nine everyday shapes no blind spot named (round 10 review, I3); each is a canary row below.
#
# BLIND SPOTS, all failing OPEN -- the line passes:
#   - a filter not in the list below, and a filter behind a WRAPPER command not in the prefix
#     list (`ionice`, `chrt`, `sudo`, ...);
#   - one invoked through a variable (`"$python3_bin" x.py < <(...)`);
#   - one whose `<(` sits on a continuation line after a `\`;
#   - a quoted argument holding an escaped quote of its own kind (`"a\"|b"`), which ends the
#     quoted run early, and any other quoting this class does not model ($'...', nested $( ));
#   - every `run:` block of `.github/workflows`, which `_shell_scripts` does not walk;
#   - a file the scan's own grep failed on, whose empty answer the `|| true` keeps -- the house
#     idiom of every extractor here, open as #1631.
# None is in the tree today; the census that said so was every `<(` in `scripts/` and in
# `.github/workflows`, classified by hand (and by the round 10 review), not this regex.
#

# --- no script captures a `wc` count without normalising it -----------------
#
# **BSD `wc` pads its count with leading blanks; GNU `wc` does not.** So
# `$(wc -c < f)` is `11` on Linux and `      11` on macOS, and a fixture that
# captures it and compares it as a STRING is green on one platform and red on the
# other. `pacectl-e2e` shipped exactly that and failed on its first macOS run
# with `--raw wrote       11 bytes, expected 11` -- a message whose two numbers are
# EQUAL, which reads as the check being broken rather than as the shell, and is the
# reading that gets an assertion deleted.
#
# The trap is asymmetric in a way that hides it: the same line computed `expected`
# inside `$(( ))`, which normalises, and `actual` as a bare capture, which does not.
# One of the two spellings was suspicious and it was not obvious which.
#
# The rule is normalisation AT CAPTURE, not "normalise where it is compared". A
# regex cannot see where a captured count is later used, and a scan that guesses is
# noise -- so this demands the stronger, uniform property. 12 of the 18 sites in the
# tree already satisfied it by hand, which is what makes it cheap: the idiom was
# already the house style and one file simply did not know.
#
# Remedy: `count_bytes` / `count_lines` from `scripts/lib/e2e-common.sh` in a
# fixture, or `| tr -d ' '` inside the substitution anywhere else.

# from needing dataflow:
#   * `| tr -d ' '` inside the substitution -- normalised at capture
#   * `$(( $(wc ...) ... ))` -- arithmetic evaluation skips blanks
#   * `[ "$(wc ...)" -le N ]` -- so does a numeric test
#
# Comment lines are stripped first. A COMMENT IS NOT A CALL SITE, and this file's

# --- no script keeps its own copy of a shared helper ------------------------
#
# The other half of #449, and the half a conversion cannot enforce on its own.
# Folding seven copies into one file says nothing about the EIGHTH, which is
# written by somebody who has never opened this file. `dist-compile-e2e.sh` WAS
# that eighth for two tickets -- #449 deferred it, #451 finished it -- and while
# it waited, its private `http_get` went on dropping a body with no trailing
# newline that another copy had already learnt to keep.
#
# What is scanned is a NAME COLLISION: a `scripts/*.sh` that defines a function
# the library already defines has a second implementation of it, whatever the
# body says. That is exact in one direction and blind in the other, and the
# blindness is said here rather than left to be found: a helper reimplemented
# under a DIFFERENT name is invisible to this. `migrate-storage-e2e.sh` spelled
# `free_port` as `port`, drawing from 40000-59999 -- entirely inside Linux's
# default ephemeral range, which is the `bind(...) failed: 98` the shared one
# moved to 20000-31999 to avoid. This scan never saw it, and could not: no regex
# over shell can. It took a person reading the file (#628, since landed), which
# is what the allowlist's per-row reasons are for -- and it is why a row is
# deleted when its defect is fixed rather than left standing as a description of
# the file. That row outlived #628 by a day and had become an exemption for a
# fixture with nothing to exempt.
#
# The names are READ from the library rather than restated here. A second copy of
# the list is not a cross-check, it is a second thing to be wrong -- and wrong in
# the silent direction, because a helper ADDED to the library would simply never
# be scanned for.

# the same reason and records the same argument.
#
# Unlike the usual cheap prefilter this one is EXACT in both directions, and that
# is worth stating because the next reader will assume it is lossy: the filter is

# --- every perl invocation is bounded, or SAYS why it is not ----------------
#
# `e2e_bounded_perl` makes the `exec` + `alarm` pair impossible to omit for
# anything that goes through it. Nothing makes a new stand-in go through it, and
# that is exactly the gap #843 is about: **a rule stated in the files that obey it
# reaches no file that does not** (#970). The three stand-ins here now carry the
# rule; the fourth, written next month in another fixture, would not -- and #834
# is the proof this is not hypothetical, having added an unbounded listener while
# the ticket about bounds was open, with the diagnosis written down.
#
# So the rule is a SCAN and not a comment, and it asks the question the door can
# answer rather than the one it cannot: not *does this perl body contain a bound*
# -- which #843 notes a naive `grep` gets wrong, since `alarm 30` appears in prose
# in this very file -- but **does any script name a perl PROGRAM outside the one
# line that arms the bound**. That is a question about command positions, which is
# the same shape as the `timeout` scan above and needs no region machinery.
#
# TWO spellings, each a claim, which is `Refuse` / `RefuseWithoutCounter` in a
# shell script:
#
#   * route through `e2e_bounded_perl` -- bounded, nothing to say;
#   * carry `# perl-lifetime: <reason>` on the invocation line -- deliberately
#     unbounded, and WHY.
#
# The second is TALLIED and printed on every run, exactly as the refusal-rationale
# check prints its per-issue totals: a marker whose reason is a placeholder must be
# visible, or "decided" and "forgot" are one spelling again. Two rows today, and
# both are read out below rather than counted.
#
# ## The census, and why it is a check rather than a sentence
#
# The injector -- the one line that arms the bound -- lives in `lib/e2e-common.sh`,
# where every fixture can reach it; it was written in this file and moved, because
# a door in one private file reaches no other script and `compile-cache-e2e.sh` had
# already grown a second one, marker and all. A scan whose subject has left the
# tree reports every file clean, and that reads identically to complete coverage,
# so the tally below REFUSES at zero rather than passing.
#
# And the scan knows WHERE the door is, because a marker is a claim anyone can
# write: exactly one line in the tree may carry the injector's marker, and it must
# be in `lib/e2e-common.sh`; a marked invocation anywhere else that arms its OWN
# `alarm` is a private door, refused even though it states a reason -- that was
# `compile-cache-e2e.sh`'s shape before it routed through the library.
#
# ## Why this reads through a declared region and the other scans' canaries do not
#
# The helper-copy canary one screen up stages its fixture with `printf` at column
# zero, and that is enough for IT because its pattern is anchored at column zero.
# This one is not: `out="$(perl -e ...)"` is a real invocation shape and has to be
# caught, so the `$(` entry point matches inside a quoted `printf` argument too --
# measured, the first run of this block failed on its own canary staging. So the
# staging sits in a `perl-scan` declared region, which is the mechanism this file
# already uses twice for exactly this, and the region is BALANCE-CHECKED and
# COUNTED below, or it is just an exemption nobody can see being added.
#
# ## The entry-point class, and the hole the mutation found
#
# `{` and `)` are ENTRY POINTS and not merely keywords, which is the correction
# this pattern needed rather than a nicety. The first draft copied the `timeout`
# scan's class -- `^ ; & | ( ` $( && ||` -- with `{` in the optional-keyword
# alternation, and the arm written to prove the rule REACHES another fixture
# planted `stage_thing() { perl -e "sleep 99" & }` in `cluster-e2e.sh` and the
# scan reported CLEAN. The `perl` there follows `) { `, and neither `)` nor `{`
# could open a match: `^` was consumed by the function name, so nothing anchored.
# A one-line brace group is the shape a hurried new stand-in takes, so the scan
# was blind to precisely its own subject in precisely the file it exists to reach.
# `)` comes with it because a `case` arm (`foo) perl -e ...`) is a command
# position by the same argument -- found by asking what ELSE the missing anchor
# would have cost rather than by patching the one shape that failed.
#
# What it does NOT reach, stated rather than left for somebody to discover: a perl
# behind a PREFIX COMMAND with flags of its own -- `nice -n 10 perl -e ...`,
# `env FOO=1 perl -e ...`, `xargs perl`. `exec` is in the alternation because it is
# the spelling every stand-in here used before the door existed; the rest are not,
# and no regex over shell text reaches them without matching the word `perl` in
# prose and in `command -v perl`, which is the noise that gets a scan deleted. That
# residue is an EVASION rather than an accident -- nobody writes `nice perl` for a
# fixture stand-in by mistake -- and the accidental shapes are the six the canary
# pins. Stating the limit is the remedy; widening the pattern is not.

# --- bash 3.2 --------------------------------------------------------------
#
# macOS ships a 2007 `/bin/bash` and these scripts run on every platform CI
# builds, so a construct newer than that is a script that does not start there.
# Scanned rather than remembered: the constraint was already written down in
# `coverage.sh`'s comments, where nobody writing a new script would find it.
#
# `BASHPID` is in the table because it is the trap that looks like the fix. A
# `[ "${BASHPID:-$$}" = "$top_pid" ]` guard is CORRECT on bash 4 and silently
# inert on 3.2, where BASHPID is unset and the test reduces to comparing `$$`
# with itself -- so the subshell defect it was written to close is closed on
# Linux and open on macOS. The unconditional `kill -TERM` avoids the question.
#
# And this row is LOAD-BEARING rather than belt-and-braces, which is only visible
# from having tried it: staging that guard back into `fail` and running this file
# on a bash 5 runner leaves `fail-subshell` GREEN, because on bash 5 the guard
# works. The behavioural case cannot see a 3.2-only defect from a 4-or-later
# shell, and every machine this is developed and tested on is a 4-or-later shell.
# The scan is the only check here that can.
#
# ## The scope, which is the half that was wrong (#627)
#
# This scan read ONE file -- `$library` -- for two tickets, while
# `launcher-replay-e2e.sh` carried the exact guard the paragraph above bans by
# name, under a comment arguing it was correct. So the repository had the rule
# written down, had a check enforcing it, and the check did not read the file
# that broke it: a confident verdict over the wrong set, the same shape as a
# clang-tidy sweep whose database was missing five of CI's targets.
#
# The set is therefore DERIVED, by walking `scripts/` for `*.sh`. Not a list: a
# list is exact about the files it knows and silent about the ones it does not,
# and silence reads identically to complete coverage (#492) -- #379 named six
# call sites where the tree had thirty. Not the two-directory glob its
# neighbours use either, which would miss the next subdirectory.
#
# Restricting the walk to `scripts/` is a scope choice, so it is CHECKED rather
# than assumed: when git is available, a tracked `*.sh` living anywhere else is
# refused by name. A classifier that cannot see a file must say so instead of
# passing it, and the day one appears outside `scripts/` this says which rather
# than quietly excluding it. Where git is not available -- an exported tarball --
# that half is reported as not run, which is a third state and not a pass.
#
# ## The whole family, and what this deliberately does NOT cover
#
# `BASHPID` is one of at least three ways bash 3.2 makes a script silently inert,
# and the general form is worth stating because it is what the next instance will
# look like: **inside a want-fail assertion, any failure to run is
# indistinguishable from the rule firing.** #723 reached it through a mode bit (a
# bare `"$0"` exited 126 and eight cases passed because the SHELL refused);
# `set -u` reaches it through expanding an empty array, which is an unbound
# variable before 4.4; `BASHPID` reaches it by making the abort a no-op.
#
# The token table covers the first and the third. It does NOT cover the empty
# array, and that is a decision rather than an omission. MEASURED on this tree:
# `"${x[@]}"` and `"$@"` occur about 110 times across the 22 scripts that set
# `-u`, and essentially every one of them is an array that cannot be empty. No
# regex over shell can tell a possibly-empty array from a never-empty one, so a
# row for it would be ~110 findings on a correct tree -- and a scan that reports
# noise is a scan somebody deletes, which costs the eight rows that do work. That
# leaves the empty-array sites as per-site tickets, which is where they already
# are (#793, #794); the remedy spelling is `${1+"$@"}`.

# these are banned and a scan that fails on its own rationale is a scan nobody
# can write the rationale for. Indented comments too, since a rationale is as
# likely to sit inside a function as above one: `lib/e2e-common.sh`'s own `fail`
# names `BASHPID` twice in the paragraph explaining why it does not use it, and
# `launcher-replay-e2e.sh` names it in the preamble recording why its private
# copy of that `fail` is gone (#813).
#
# And a file may declare a DATA REGION, between
#
#     # bash32-scan: data-begin
#     # bash32-scan: data-end

# table and the canary's staged text, and both are data rather than constructs
# this shell executes. The alternative -- and what this replaced -- was an
# allowlist row exempting the whole file, which is the wrong altitude by three
# orders of magnitude: `check-e2e-helpers.sh` is over 1700 lines, is the heaviest
# array user under `scripts/`, and IS RUN BY CTEST through `/bin/bash`, so on
# macOS it is a bash 3.2 script like any other. Exempting it wholesale would make
# the one file the scan can never read the one file most likely to break the rule
# -- and the neighbouring helper scan explicitly refused to pay that price 200
# lines up.
#
# Blank lines are substituted rather than deleted, so `grep -n` keeps reporting
# the real line numbers.
#
# A region opened and never closed would blank the rest of the file, so it is
# refused below rather than tolerated, and the number of regions is REPORTED --
# a region nobody can see added is this mechanism's own way of becoming an
# exemption.

# buys the greps back and then pays part of it out again for the region and
# comment filtering it also does. Today 15 of the 31 hold no token at all and

#     REPORTED reading, with the reason it is not a bound. A read that matches no
#     row is refused.

# does not match itself, and declared as a REGION rather than a whole-file exemption
# so the rest of this file, its own two timings above included, stays scanned.

# What counts as a read of bash's `SECONDS`, spelled ONCE and used by both the
# per-file walk and the extractor -- two sites, and a scan whose two halves can
# disagree about what it is looking for is two scans.
#
# A WHOLE WORD, and that is the correction rather than a nicety. It was a bare
# `grep -n 'SECONDS'`, which is a substring: `PACE_SCAN_BUDGET_SECONDS`,
# `READY_SECONDS` and any other identifier ENDING in the token matched, and so
# would one beginning with it. `pgrep -f` in a `grep` -- a pattern is broader than
# its author reads it as -- and it is the same family as this file's own
# `perl-bounds-scan` needing `{` and `)` as entry points.
#
# The tell was not a red run. **It was an exemption**: the row below for
# `node-socket-activation-e2e.sh` said, in its own words, *"a READY_SECONDS budget
# handed to wait_until, which is a NAME matched by the word rather than a clock
# read of its own"* -- an allowlist row whose stated reason IS the false positive,
# blinding the scan to that whole fixture to silence one identifier. A false
# positive teaches people to work around it, and working around it is what
# disarms a scan as thoroughly as deleting it. Another lane hit the same pattern
# on a `..._BUDGET_SECONDS` CMake variable and renamed AROUND it, which is the
# second instance of the same cost.
#
# So the row is gone with the defect that produced it, and the file it named is
# scanned again -- measured, it has no wall-clock read at all. Deleting it is not
# optional either: the "an exemption for a file with no SECONDS read left in it"
# guard one screen down would refuse the tree for a row naming a file the fixed
# pattern no longer matches, which is that guard doing exactly its job.

#   * this file's own timings of a whole process from OUTSIDE, which is the one

#     and `bounded-outlasts-a-trapped-term` exist to take. Their VERDICTS are now
#     monotonic co-timers, so what is left of them here is the realtime figure they
#     PRINT beside it -- the first kind, arrived at from the second.

# --- every failure is recorded BY NAME ------------------------------------
#
# `note_failure` exists so the count and the name cannot be recorded in different
# places, and that only holds while it is the ONLY thing that touches the counter.
# Nineteen sites incremented `failures` by hand before #678; a twentieth written the
# old way would compile, run, pass, and go back to reporting `1 failed` with no name
# -- which is the omission the function was introduced to make impossible.
#
# So this scans its own source, the way the bash-3.2 check above scans the library.
# One increment is expected: the one inside `note_failure` itself.
#
# The pattern is written as a regex with `[+]` rather than as the literal text, so
# this scan cannot COUNT ITSELF -- which it did on the first run, reporting three
# increments where there is one, because the needle appeared verbatim in the needle.
#
# It fails in BOTH directions. An extra increment names a site that bypassed the
# helper; ZERO increments means the scan has stopped seeing what it thinks it is
# reading -- a rename of the counter would otherwise leave this passing forever
# while guarding nothing.

# `(( failures++ ))` each incremented without naming the failure and passed this
# scan silently -- which is the reopen-by-omission it exists to make impossible.
#
# `failure[s]` rather than `failures`: the needle must not appear verbatim in
# itself, which is the self-counting trap the paragraph above records. The
# bracket makes the regex match "failures" while the literal text of these lines
# does not match the regex.

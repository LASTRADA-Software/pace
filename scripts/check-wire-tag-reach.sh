#
# Every Catch2 case in a wholly-wire test file carries `[wire]` (#1285).
#
# WHY A SCAN AND NOT JUST THE TAG RUN. `wire-tag-reach-count` runs
# `PaceTest "[wire]"` and pins how many cases RAN, which catches a tag being
# deleted, a case being removed, or the binary losing a translation unit. It cannot
# catch the thing that actually happened: a case ADDED without the tag leaves the
# pinned count untouched and the run green. That is how `[wire]` came to reach 69 of
# the 119 cases in `CompileCacheWire_test.cpp` -- the tag arrived partway through the
# file's life and was never backfilled, and every count anyone took was correct about
# a set that was not the one they meant.
#
# So the two registrations are complements and neither is redundant:
#   - the RUN pins the population downward (a tag lost, a case gone),
#   - this SCAN pins it upward (a case arriving untagged).
#
# WHAT THIS CHECKS, precisely: for each file in the table below, the number of case
# headers equals the number of `[wire]` mentions. It is a count identity rather than a
# per-case walk, and that is deliberate -- a C++ header walk in bash 3.2 is a parser
# nobody should maintain, and the identity is exactly the property. A tag string
# carries `[wire]` at most once, so the two numbers agree iff every case carries it.
#
# STATED BLIND SPOT, and the direction matters. Full-line comments are stripped, so a
# `[wire]` mentioned in a trailing comment on a line of code would be counted and could
# MASK one missing tag. That fails toward "nothing unusual here", so it is named rather
# than left for a reader to rediscover; what it cannot do is invent a violation. A
# `[wire]` inside a case NAME would do the same. Neither exists today and both would be
# odd things to write; if one lands, this check reports a count identity that holds for
# the wrong reason, and the tag RUN above is what still disagrees.
#
# WHY A TABLE AND NOT A GLOB. "Every case here is a wire case" is a judgement about a
# file's subject, not something derivable from its name or contents:
# `ClusterState_test.cpp` carries 16 wire cases among 47, and
# `SchedulerService_test.cpp` carries 1 among 57. A glob over `*Wire*` would demand the
# tag on cases that are not about the wire, and a check that refuses correct code is
# one somebody disables. Each row therefore states why the whole file qualifies.
#
# Needs no compiler, no build, no daemon, no socket and no network -- it reads source.

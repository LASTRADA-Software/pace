# The exit codes `docs/tools/pacectl.md` lists are `OutcomeTable`'s, row for row:
# the same codes, the same names, the same meanings.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# `OutcomeTable` in `src/apps/pacectl/CliAnswer.hpp` is where an exit code is
# decided, and `--help` renders it, so the help cannot drift. The operator page could:
# its `## Exit codes` section restated all six codes by hand, under a sentence that
# restated their COUNT as well, and #134 added a seventh (`local`). A listing written by
# hand is right until the table grows, and the table grows exactly when a verb meets a
# case none of the existing codes answers -- which is the edit where a doc table is
# forgotten.
#
# The cost is not cosmetic. An exit code is the one part of this tool a script reads,
# and the page is where a script's author looks it up. A code missing from the page is
# a status somebody's `case` falls through; a code the page gives a different MEANING is
# a script that retries the server when the remedy is on this machine.
#
# ## Why the meaning is compared as well, word for word
#
# Comparing codes and names alone would let the prose beside each drift, and the prose
# is what a reader acts on. So the page carries the table's text verbatim. The page's
# own explanation lives BELOW the table, in the pairs that matter, where no check reads.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, stated rather than left to be discovered
#
#   * The prose outside the table -- the pairs list, the example script, and
#     `docs/tools/index.md`'s summary. A sentence is not a list, and the sentences no
#     longer state how many codes there are, which is the claim that went stale.
#   * A meaning `CliAnswer.hpp` spells as two concatenated string literals, or one
#     carrying an escaped quote. The reader sees only the first literal, so such a row
#     REFUSES as differing -- loudly, naming the row -- rather than passing. Joining the
#     literal is the remedy; the check does not grow a C++ string parser.
#   * Two rows written on one source line. `clang-format` does not lay the table out
#     that way; a row is closed when the next `.outcome =` opens.
#
# ## Constraints
#
# bash 3.2 (macOS ships a 2007 `/bin/bash` and this runs in the default ctest set): no
# `mapfile`, `declare -A`, `${var^^}` or `local -n`. Rows travel as tab-separated lines,
# and are never split with `IFS=$'\t' read`, which collapses an empty field and shifts
# every field after it -- the comparison is one awk program instead.

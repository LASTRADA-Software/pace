# Dropping a config file from the packaging asset table stops NEW packages
# shipping it. It does not remove the copy an older package already put on disk:
# a package manager will not silently delete something it has classified as an
# operator's to edit. So retiring a config file is TWO edits -- delete the asset
# row, and add the path to FASTCACHED_PLATFORM_OBSOLETE_CONFIG -- and the second
# is the one nobody does, because the first one makes the tree look finished.
# `compile-node.env` survived every upgrade for four releases that way (#291,
# #383).
#
# ## What is asserted, and why it is split across two modes
#
# The DEFAULT mode reads source and runs everywhere, including the platforms
# that have no dpkg at all. It cannot see a package, so it asserts the two
# things that are true of the tree:
#
#   * a path is never in BOTH tables. dpkg-deb REFUSES to build a package whose
#     conffiles flags a file that is in the payload, so this mistake surfaces as
#     a packaging-job failure with a message about the archive rather than about
#     the table -- and only on the one job that builds a .deb.
#   * `cmake/Packaging.cmake` actually emits the flag. Without it the export is
#     computed, threaded through, and dropped, which is invisible everywhere.
#
# `--deb <file>` is the behavioural half and needs a real package, so it runs in
# the packaging job. It performs a REAL dpkg upgrade of the REAL package in a
# throwaway root: install a synthesised predecessor that ships the retired path
# as an ordinary conffile, plant an operator edit in it, then unpack the built
# .deb over it. `dpkg --unpack` is enough -- measured: the obsolete conffile is
# retired during UNPACK, before any maintainer script runs -- which is what lets
# this check skip dependency resolution and scriptlets entirely.
#
# ## The control is the point
#
# Both halves carry a positive control, because every refusal here has a way of
# passing for the wrong reason. A parser that matched nothing would report an
# empty intersection and call the tree clean, so the default mode refuses when
# it found no shipped config row at all. And an upgrade that emptied /etc would
# satisfy "the retired file is gone", so `--deb` asserts a config file the new
# package STILL ships is still there afterwards. Removing the right file and
# removing everything are the same assertion without it.
#
# Exit: 0 clean, 1 a rule was broken, 2 usage, 77 a prerequisite is missing.

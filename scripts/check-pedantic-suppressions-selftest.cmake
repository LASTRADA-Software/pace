# `check-pedantic-suppressions.cmake` driven against synthetic subject files, so
# every verdict it can reach has been watched.
#
# The check's whole job is to REFUSE, and a check that refuses nothing on a clean
# tree is indistinguishable from one that cannot refuse at all. It was watched
# failing on 0db96dc8 before the fix landed -- naming exactly the four `-Wno-`
# suppressions, twice, once per GNU-style persona -- and that observation is a fact
# about one commit, which stops being reproducible the moment the fix is in. This
# is the part that keeps reproducing.
#
# Each case is a whole synthetic `PedanticCompiler.cmake`, not a patch of the real
# one: the real file is what the check is FOR, and building the negative cases out
# of it would make this test pass or fail for reasons belonging to that file rather
# than to the rule.
#
# Every case is driven by a nested `cmake -P` whose `RESULT_VARIABLE` is READ. An
# unread one exits 0 carrying its child's `CMake Error` on the output, which is the
# shape `script-check-canary` is built out of -- and inside a want-fail assertion
# any way of not running is indistinguishable from the rule firing. The verdict is
# taken from the OUTPUT as well, because that is how ctest hears these checks and a
# check that only WARNS exits 0.

# When a version-mismatched `pace-cc` hands the build to somebody else, the
# operator is told so — and told what took over — in one place, checked as a pure
# computation over the combinations a configure cannot be made to produce.
#
# `cmake/portable/CompileCache.cmake` prints a rejected launcher at `STATUS` and,
# eighty lines later, warns about the correctness hazard the replacement carries.
# Neither mentions the other, and one rejection reason — a WIRE VERSION mismatch —
# is exactly the one that predicts the hazard: a daemon IS running, the operator
# installed it, and it is out of step with the launcher
# ([#658](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/658)).
#
# **And the winner decides a paragraph, not whether there is a message**
# ([#815](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/815)). #658 warned
# only when the winner carried a caveat, which is a property of the COMPILER — true
# on MSVC and clang-cl, false on GCC and Clang. The host that filed #815 is Linux
# with ccache installed, so it satisfied every clause and heard nothing above
# `STATUS` while its own cache went unused for weeks. Three replacements, three
# wordings, one warning: a safe launcher, a hazardous one, and none at all.
#
# ## Why a pure function
#
# Producing the situation for real needs a `pace-cc` and a `pace-kv` whose
# WIRE VERSIONS disagree, both installed, with the daemon answering — and then an
# MSVC-family compiler for the caveat to exist at all, which this host does not
# have. That is not a fixture; it is a second machine and a downgrade. So the
# DECISION takes its four inputs as arguments and reads nothing, and the rows below
# state each combination explicitly.
#
# What this cannot cover is the wiring — that `_fc_cache_pace_cc_rejected_why`
# is set where the row is rejected and read where the fallback is chosen. Stated
# rather than implied: only a real configure exercises that, and the narrow guard
# is that the reason is remembered as a VARIABLE rather than parsed back out of the
# display sentence, so a rewording of the status line cannot silently disarm it.
#
# Verdict is read from the OUTPUT, not the exit code, because that is the contract
# every `cmake -P` check here is registered under -- the measurement and the
# reasons live in `scripts/check-script-check-signals.cmake` and are deliberately
# not restated here (#565).

# a special case is one that has to be rewritten to generalise the code, which is

# the same mistake made once more, in the other column.

# No ';' in any field: the row LIST splits on it before `pace_row_fields`

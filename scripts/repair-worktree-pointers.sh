# Make a linked worktree readable by BOTH gits on this machine.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The problem, and why the documented remedy was not one
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `git worktree add` writes ABSOLUTE pointers, in the spelling of whichever git
# created the worktree. A worktree created from Windows therefore holds
#
#     <worktree>/.git                      gitdir: D:/repo/.git/worktrees/<name>
#     <repo>/.git/worktrees/<name>/gitdir  D:/worktrees/<name>/.git
#
# and WSL git, which has no `D:`, resolves that against the CURRENT directory and
# reports
#
#     fatal: not a git repository: /mnt/d/worktrees/<name>/D:/repo/.git/worktrees/<name>
#
# -- measured, and note the shape: the two paths are CONCATENATED, so the error
# names a path that exists nowhere and reads like a corrupt repository rather than
# a pointer in the wrong dialect.
#
# `scripts/local-gate.sh` is the only thing that exercises GCC before CI does, and
# it needs git for its formatter list, its header-filter census and its test
# registration walk. In such a worktree every one of those answers NOTHING, so the
# gate refuses -- correctly since #1064, having previously passed -- and the
# compiler-specific defects it exists to catch reach CI every time (#336).
#
# **The documented remedy was "create the worktree from inside WSL", which is
# advice nobody in this workflow can take**: worktrees are created by the harness
# from the Windows side and a session does not choose its creating shell. A remedy
# only available in a worktree nobody has is what that ticket is about.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What this does instead
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Rewrites both pointers RELATIVE, which both gits resolve identically -- neither a
# drive letter nor a mount point appears in them -- PROVIDED the worktree and the
# repository sit on the same Windows root:
#
#     <worktree>/.git                      gitdir: ../../repo/.git/worktrees/<name>
#     <repo>/.git/worktrees/<name>/gitdir  ../../../../worktrees/<name>/.git
#
# **That proviso is not a detail; an earlier version of this header said "every git"
# without it, and it was false.** WSL mounts every drive under one root (`/mnt/c`,
# `/mnt/d`), so a relative path can climb out of one drive and into another -- and
# Windows cannot: there is no `..` above `C:\`. A worktree on C: of a repository on D:
# got `gitdir: ../../<...>/d/<repo>/...`, which WSL read and Windows git refused as "not
# a git repository", while this script printed "repaired" and exited 0, having checked
# only with the git that ran it. So the two Windows roots -- a drive letter, or a UNC
# share such as WSL's own `\\wsl.localhost\<distro>` -- are compared BEFORE anything is
# written, and a mismatch is REFUSED by name: no relative pointer can serve both gits.
#
# **NOT `git worktree repair`**, which is the obvious answer and is the wrong
# direction: it rewrites the pointers ABSOLUTE in the dialect of whichever git runs
# it, so running it from Windows reproduces this state and running it from WSL
# breaks the Windows side instead. The property wanted here is that BOTH gits read
# the same tree, and only a relative pointer has it.
#
# **AND NEVER `git config core.worktree`.** That is not a stylistic preference: six
# scripts under `scripts/` run `git init` in synthetic trees, and with `GIT_DIR` and
# `GIT_WORK_TREE` exported into a `ctest` run those `git init` calls write
# `core.worktree` into the SHARED `.git/config` -- after which Windows git fails in
# EVERY worktree at once with `fatal: Invalid path '/mnt'` while WSL git keeps
# working. A lane did exactly that on this machine. Nothing here writes git CONFIG
# at all; it writes two pointer FILES and nothing else.
#
# RUN IT UNDER THE GIT THAT CANNOT READ THE WORKTREE, which is the whole point
# and is easy to get backwards. The absolute `D:/` pointer is unreadable to WSL's
# git and perfectly readable to Windows git, so running this from Git Bash on a
# worktree WSL cannot open prints
#
#     worktree: <path> is readable by this git (N tracked file(s))
#
# and repairs nothing. That sentence is TRUE -- it says *this* git -- and it reads
# as success, so the next thing that runs under WSL fails for a reason the check
# just appeared to rule out. Measured: a session lost a `ctest` run to exactly
# that, diagnosing a registration defect that did not exist. A claim about a tool
# is checked against THAT tool; here the tool is the git that is failing.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/repair-worktree-pointers.sh                 diagnose this worktree
#   scripts/repair-worktree-pointers.sh --apply         and repair it
#   scripts/repair-worktree-pointers.sh --self-test
#
#   wsl -e bash scripts/repair-worktree-pointers.sh --apply     from Windows, when
#                                                               WSL is the git that
#                                                               cannot read it
#
# Exit, one code per ANSWER, so a caller can tell "run it with --apply" from "this
# script cannot help" without parsing prose:
#   0  the worktree is readable (already, or after `--apply`)
#   1  it is not, and it IS repairable: report-only mode did not apply the repair --
#      re-run with `--apply`. Never 0: the tree is still broken, and a status saying
#      otherwise would be read as one that had been repaired.
#   2  usage, or a path that cannot be entered
#   3  it is not readable and this script CANNOT repair it, in either mode, refused by
#      name: no `.git`, a plain clone, a relative pointer that still fails, a fault it
#      cannot name, an admin directory that does not exist here, pointers it cannot
#      compute, or a repair that left the tree unreadable

    # -- and was refused. Staged with a `wslpath` that translates one share both ways,
    # over the REAL admin directory, so the repair runs end to end and real git must read
    # the result.

    # EXISTING in 48 ms, and with such a pointer the whole self-test went from 3 s to 21 s
    # -- and ran without end once the fix was neutered. `//localhost/<a share nobody has>` is the same

    # POSIX host either -- so the pointer is unreadable before the repair wherever this runs.

# `gate-target-set` must be SEEN to refuse, on each thing it claims and on nothing
# else -- and to ACCEPT, which is the direction a guard is not known to work in
# until somebody has watched it.
#
# The subject makes that unusually easy to get wrong. `gate-target-set` runs
# against THIS tree, where the two sides agree, so it reports the same clean line
# whether the comparison is live or the reader has stopped matching. And the
# defect it exists for -- #1144's, where CI builds a target the gate does not --
# is invisible on a tree that has never drifted.
#
# ## The trees are staged from the REAL four files
#
# Each case copies `scripts/local-gate.sh`, `.github/workflows/build.yml`,
# `src/apps/CMakeLists.txt` and the root `CMakeLists.txt` verbatim and mutates one
# of them. Nothing here restates a flag set: a second list is not a cross-check,
# it is a second thing to be wrong.
#
# Every mutation ASSERTS ITS ANCHOR MATCHED EXACTLY ONCE -- count, not presence,
# so `missing` and `not unique` both fire. An edit script that silently anchored
# on nothing reports success for work it did not do, and the case then passes or
# fails for a reason that has nothing to do with the rule.
#
# ## The verdict is the OUTPUT, and it is FLATTENED first
#
# `message(WARNING)` exits 0 on every CMake while printing a diagnostic, so a
# check that merely warned would pass an exit-code test. And CMake WRAPS a
# diagnostic at about 74 columns, so a phrase can exist in the output and in no
# single LINE of it.
#
# ## A spawn that never RAN is not a verdict
#
# `execute_process` reports a failure to LAUNCH as a STRING rather than a number,
# and a discarded `RESULT_VARIABLE` reads that as the check having answered --
# every `refuse` arm then passes and every `pass` arm fails, which presents as a
# rule regression and sends the next reader hunting a defect that is not there.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-gate-target-set-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit: the verdict is the OUTPUT, not the status.

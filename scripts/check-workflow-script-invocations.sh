# A workflow's script invocation must agree with that script's file mode.

# A `run:` line naming `scripts/x.sh` either spells an interpreter (`bash x.sh`)
# or relies on the executable bit. When it relies on the bit and the file is 644,
# the step exits 126 -- Permission denied -- and that is a CI-ONLY failure: a local
# run never reproduces it, because a human types `bash` in front of the script by
# habit.
#
# It has happened twice (#721, #723). Once inside a `--self-test` re-invoking
# itself as a bare "$0", where eight `want-fail` cases passed because the SHELL
# refused rather than because the rule fired -- green, testing nothing. Once in
# `build.yml`, in a step whose `name:` is a REQUIRED context.
#
# The rule is AGREEMENT, not a spelling. `scripts/ci-scope.sh` is 755 and invoked
# bare, and that is correct and must keep passing; demanding `bash` everywhere
# would fail a tree that is right.

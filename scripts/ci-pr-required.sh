# What is the state of every REQUIRED context on one pull request, by name.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# Two situations present identically in `gh pr checks` and need opposite
# responses (#542): a REQUIRED context that is skipped or absent is a merge
# blocker that will never clear on its own, and a NON-REQUIRED context that is
# failing frequently blocks nothing. Told apart by eye they collapse, and
# collapsing them is wrong in both directions -- it either blocks a mergeable
# pull request on a cosmetic failure, or it queues one whose required set will
# never complete. `gh pr checks` renders required and non-required
# typographically identically and has no idea which is which.
#
# ## Four states, and a count is not a verdict
#
# `AGENT.md`: skipped, absent, unstarted and failed are four states, and tooling
# collapses them. "10 of 11" does not say whether the eleventh is RUNNING or
# ABSENT, and those are a wait and a blocker. So every required context is
# printed by name with its own state, and the totals are evidence rather than the
# verdict.
#
# The enumeration is closed and RECONCILED: the per-state counts must sum to the
# number of required contexts, asserted on every run. A state this script does
# not know is `UNKNOWN` and refuses -- an unguarded default arm is where the last
# three collapses in this repository were introduced, each while fixing the one
# before it.
#
# ## The withdrawn case (#903)
#
# #903 describes a required context that reports and then leaves "an absence
# where a verdict was". **That state does not exist**, and this script is written
# against what does. Measured on the pair the ticket names (runs 34009668478 and
# 34009671900, SHA a2f8359): GitHub deletes nothing, so that commit still lists
# THREE `Require a type label` check runs -- one `cancelled` and two `success`.
# The observable is a cancelled verdict that was superseded, not a missing one.
#
# So the hazard is real under a different name, and it is a predicate rather than
# a state: a required context whose LATEST check run is `cancelled` with no newer
# run for it queued or in progress. A benign supersession fails that predicate by
# construction -- the replacement is either in flight or already the latest -- so
# this does not fire on every multi-label edit, which is the failure mode #903's
# third clause warns about and the one that gets a check disabled within a week.
#
# ## Acquisition and decision are separate
#
# `--record` takes the check-run record and calls no API, which is what lets the
# self-test drive every verdict without a network or a pull request. `--pr`
# fetches and then calls the same decision. Nothing in the decision reads a clock
# or a socket. This is the shape `ci-merge-group-report.sh` uses and is checked
# the same way.
#
# ## And a FIFTH state: the instrument could not ask
#
# The four above are states of a check run. This one is a state of the tool, and
# it is the one that gets folded in: an exhausted API budget returns an error,
# and a caller that reads the RESULT of a `--jq` pipeline gets an empty answer.
# Empty reads as *no required context is failing*. So "could not ask" is its own
# outcome with its own exit status (3) and its own wording, and it is never
# reported as ABSENT. The details, the measurement behind them and why there is
# no retry are on `Unavailable` below.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE INSTRUMENT COULD NOT ASK -- its own outcome, exit 3, never folded into a
# verdict about the pull request.
#
# An exhausted API budget returns an ERROR, and a caller that pipes it through
# `--jq` and reads the RESULT gets an EMPTY ANSWER. An empty answer to *which
# required contexts are failing* reads as NONE ARE. That is this file's own
# four-states rule arriving through a new door: a query that could not RUN,
# presented as a query that found NOTHING.
#
# Measured 2026-09-10 on this account: `gh project item-list` and every other
# GraphQL call refused with `API rate limit exceeded for user ID 56763` while
# `gh api rate_limit` reported `graphql: 5000/5000`. So `rate_limit` is NOT a
# usable precondition check -- it answers for a different limit than the one that
# fired -- and the only honest readings are a real call's response headers or the
# refusal itself. This tool takes the second: it asks, and says so when what came
# back is not an answer.
#
# **There is no retry.** A retry makes an instrument's own failures disappear
# without fixing them, and this is the class of failure whose entire cost is
# being invisible. If one is ever added it must SAY that it retried and how many
# times, or the same silence comes back wearing a fix.

# THE HEAD MOVED UNDER THE WAIT -- its own outcome, exit 4 (#1289).

# A fifth answer beside settled, running, absent and failed, and it is not a

# from the SAME response that yields `mergeable_state`, so the two cannot
# describe different moments. If it has moved, every verdict this tool could
# print is about a commit that is no longer the head -- and the contexts of the
# NEW head have their own states nobody has looked at.
#
# It REFUSES rather than silently re-basing onto the new head. A waiter that
# follows the head is answering a question nobody asked: the caller asked about
# the tree it pushed, and a force-push during the wait means somebody else's
# tree is now under the same number. Reporting the new head's verdict under the
# old head's question is how a green is attributed to the wrong commit.

# is the decision that force-push exists to trip.

#
# `stop-decided` is the clause the ticket names: a head that CONFLICTS does not
# clean itself, so it exits on the refusal it already has rather than polling to
# the timeout and printing the same thing. Only `merges` and `uncomputed` are
# still open -- `behind`, `conflicts`, `history` and `refuse` have all decided
# something waiting cannot change.
#
# **ABSENT IS NOT SETTLED, AND THAT IS WHY THIS TAKES FIVE INPUTS.** A required
# context that has not been dispatched is RUNNING=0 and ABSENT=1, and keying
# `stop-settled` on RUNNING alone read that as *everything concluded* -- so a
# `--wait` on a pull request whose checks had not started yet returned on poll 1
# announcing a settled verdict over contexts nothing had run. That is the
# four-state collapse this file exists to refuse, in the wait loop rather than in
# the tally. `absent` therefore holds the answer open exactly as `running` does.
#
# The three readings of ABSENT are three different facts, and the merge kind is
# what separates them:
#
#   * absent while the head MERGES -- CI has not dispatched yet, or a matrix leg
#     has not expanded. Open: `poll`, and `stop-timeout` once the ceiling is up.
#   * absent while the head CONFLICTS -- GitHub computes no merge ref for a
#     conflicting pull request and dispatches NOTHING, so these contexts will
#     never arrive and no ceiling is long enough. `stop-decided`, and the caller
#     says which of the two silences this was.
#   * nothing absent and nothing running -- every required context reported.
#     `stop-settled`, which is now a claim about both counts.

# WHETHER THE HEAD MERGES -- a second question, answered on its own line (#1352).
#
# Every verdict above is about check runs AT THE HEAD SHA, and a check run is never taken
# back. A pull request that BECAME conflicting after its runs finished keeps every one of
# them, values and all, while nothing further dispatches -- so on such a head this tool
# used to print `every required context reports SUCCESS` about a commit that cannot merge.
# That is the dangerous green: a red invites investigation, a green invites merging, and
# this is the script every lane is told to verify CI with. So it asks the pull request's
# merge state as well, and says it beside the context verdict rather than folding it in.
#
# From REST's `mergeable_state` and `mergeable`, never GraphQL's `mergeStateStatus`, for
# the budget reason `--pr` gives. REST spells the states in lowercase.
#
# A TABLE, and a state it does not name is REFUSED by name: the next word GitHub adds must
# not land in a default arm and read as clean. `unknown` is not clean either -- GitHub
# computes mergeability lazily, so the first query after a push routinely answers it.
# `draft` hides the merge state, so a draft's kind is read from `mergeable` instead: our
# pull requests are opened as drafts, and a draft that conflicts must not read as fine.
# `merged` and `closed` are not GitHub merge states at all -- `--pr` substitutes them from
# the same response -- because a pull request that is no longer open answers `unknown`
# FOREVER, and telling a lane to ask again about a question nobody will compute is the
# collapse in the other direction. Measured on #1383, merged: `unknown` with `null`.
#

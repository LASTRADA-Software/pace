# Two compile-node PROCESSES on one host must not share a scratch root (#279).
#
# The acceptance criterion from the ticket, as a test: two nodes, same toolchain,
# concurrent compiles of DIFFERENT translation units, each getting its own object.
#
# Each node is SOLITARY -- a fleet of its own, whose scheduler leases its own worker --
# and each client dispatches to its own node. The property needs no fleet: it is about
# two worker PROCESSES on one host claiming scratch roots under one TEMP, and that is
# why this stays a real-process script rather than an in-process case. Exclusive
# claiming is decided by the operating system between processes (a lock file beside
# the root), and no arrangement inside one process reaches that.
#
# Why an end-to-end fixture and not only the unit tests beside `ScratchClaim.cpp`:
# those prove the claim mechanism, this proves the WIRING -- that the node actually
# claims a root before it compiles anything. The defect was never in the mechanism;
# there was no mechanism, and every unit test in the tree passed.
#
# Two phases, and the second is the control that makes the first mean something:
#
#   1. Both nodes inherit one TEMP, so both derive the same scratch base.
#   2. One node is given a TEMP of its own, so the bases differ and nothing else
#      about the run changes.
#
# Before the fix, phase 1 lost a compile and phase 2 did not, which is what isolated
# the scratch root as the cause. Both must now be clean.
#
# The overlap is asserted rather than assumed: without it each node takes its root
# in sequence, nothing is contended, and the run reports green having tested nothing.

# The toolchain survey's two bounds, and the relation between them (#1157).
#
# ## Why this is not a fourth budget
#
# The survey wait has had three ceilings -- 90, then 300 (#354), then 600 (#428) --
# and every one of them was outrun. #354 is closed saying a guard widened once and
# blown through again is not a tuning problem, and it is right, because the quantity
# these numbers are set against is not stable. Measured, one walker, MSVC `cl.exe`:
#
#   | where                                    | files | cost                    |
#   |------------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------|
#   | Windows-clangcl-release, run that filed   |  5136 | 4931 done at 600 s,     |
#   | #1157 (windows-2025, GitHub-hosted)       |       | 8 file/s cumulative,    |
#   |                                           |       | so ~642 s for the walk  |
#   | the SAME leg, same day, same test order,  |  5136 | the whole fixture in    |
#   | one commit later                          |       | 96.20 s, so >= 53 file/s|
#   | this developer box, warm page cache,      |  6183 | 2.2 s, ~2800 file/s     |
#   | NVMe, Defender exclusions on the tree     |       |                         |
#
# Same runner class, same position in the run (this fixture is the first test on
# that leg to walk `cl.exe`'s include tree, so it always pays the cold one), an
# order of magnitude apart. A ceiling derived from any single reading is derived
# from one sample of that spread, which is why three of them have gone.
#
# ## What IS stable: the node says what it is doing
#
# `ToolchainHashProgress` emits a line every `DefaultInterval` while the hash runs.
# So this wait can be bounded the way a dispatched compile is
# (`.agent/rules/wire-and-protocol.md`): a SLIDING idle deadline against a known
# cadence, re-armed by every line, with the ceiling left as a backstop. Silence
# against something that would otherwise be said is evidence; a ceiling is not.
#
# That is what pays for the ceiling being generous. It is no longer the instrument
# that tells a slow host from a wedged one -- the idle bound is -- so a slow but
# genuinely progressing walk is allowed to finish, and a wedge is caught in three
# minutes instead of ten.
#
# ## The two numbers
#
# The cadence and the idle bound are ONE pair, and the relation is the load-bearing
# part: a bound at or below the cadence refuses healthy nodes on their own jitter.
# `Invoke-SelfTest` asserts the relation rather than the values, so changing either
# in isolation is a red test rather than a silent regression.
#
# 180 s is 18x the cadence, and it is not smaller because of the one phase inside
# this wait that logs NOTHING: between `read the compiler banner` and
# `hashing <n> toolchain file(s)` the node resolves the include roots (registry,
# environment and filesystem reads -- no spawn, see `IncludeSearchRoots`) and then
# ENUMERATES them serially. That enumeration has never been measured on a slow
# runner, so the bound covers it with room rather than pretending to know it.
#
# Anything OTHER than a progress line that grows the log makes this bound more
# lenient, never less -- it can delay a failure, never invent one -- which is the
# safe direction for a signal this fixture reads as progress.

$SurveyIdleSeconds = 180
$SurveySeconds = 1200

# How long a wait may be silent before its log-growth signal stops counting as
# progress.
#
# Pure, so `Invoke-SelfTest` can pin BOTH arms and the relation between the idle
# bound and the limit derived from it. Get that relation wrong and a wait that
# ended ON the idle bound would still report "the log was still growing", which is
# the exact `-or` mistake `Get-WaitVerdict`'s header records: a signal that cannot
# be false in the failing case is not evidence.

        # a ceiling this generous a tenth of it would exceed the bound and the
        # comparison would be vacuous.
        #
        # **The `Min` is the whole guarantee and it is not decoration.** The first
        # version of this function was `Max(5, idle * 0.75)`, which holds the
        # relation at the production pair (135 < 180) and INVERTS it at any bound
        # below seven seconds: at `idleSeconds = 4` the floor returns 5, a wait that
        # ended on four seconds of silence has `StalledFor = 4 < 5`, and the verdict
        # is "the log was still growing" about a wait that gave up BECAUSE it had
        # stopped. That is `Get-WaitVerdict`'s own recorded error arriving through
        # the arithmetic instead of through an `-or`, and a self-test that pinned
        # only the production pair passed over it -- it was caught by driving a real
        # wait, which is why the relation is now asserted across a RANGE of bounds

    # Three separate errors, and the third is the one worth remembering.
    #
    # 1. `cpuDuringWait` was CUMULATIVE over the whole wait and was read as a claim
    #    about the process's state AT THE DEADLINE. 3.4s spread evenly over 300s and
    #    3.4s burned in the first ten seconds followed by a wedge are the same
    #    number and opposite diagnoses. A duty cycle over that same window does not
    #    fix it -- it is the same number divided by the same 300. Only a RECENT
    #    window can answer a question about now, so that is what the verdict is
    #    drawn from and the totals are evidence only.
    #
    # 2. No MAGNITUDE bar can be calibrated here. The whole Windows SDK include tree
    #    is 9,487 files and walks warm in 0.1s at 88% duty; the same walk on a cold,
    #    virus-scanned, contended runner is I/O bound and burns a tiny fraction of
    #    that. Healthy duty for this one operation spans two orders of magnitude, so
    #    a bar set high enough to exclude idle noise would call a genuinely working
    #    cold walk BLOCKED -- and send somebody hunting a hang that is not there.
    #    What does not vary is ZERO: a blocked thread accrues no CPU at any
    #    temperature. So the test is PRESENCE in a recent window, not magnitude, and
    #    everything between "idle" and "clearly working" is reported as neither.
    #
    # 3. The two signals CONTRADICTED each other and an `-or` let the weaker one win
    #    unopposed: `$progressing` was False (the log had not grown in 300s) and
    #    `$busy` was True (3.4s >= 1.0s), and the disjunction reported WORKING. An
    #    `-or` is right for two independent CONFIRMATIONS and wrong for two
    #    competing READINGS. `logGrew=True` was true and uninformative -- it counted
    #    the two startup lines landing in different polls -- and printing it beside a
    #    conclusion lent it authority it had not earned. A signal that cannot be
    #    false in the failing case is not evidence.
    #
    # The process TREE is not a refinement of this, it is required for correctness:
    # between the fingerprint line and the first registration the node spawns `cl` two
    # or three times and then sits in a kernel wait at zero own-CPU while the child
    # works. Recent-window own-CPU alone would call that BLOCKED, which is error 2
    # again from the other end. The earlier version documented this limitation in
    # prose and told the reader to run `Get-Process cl` by hand; the instrument does

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `Get-WaitVerdict`, against synthesised readings.
#
# This exists because the classifier was WRONG in production and nothing noticed.
# Asked why a worker had not come up in five minutes it answered "the process was
# still WORKING (it consumed CPU throughout)" about a process that had written
# nothing for the whole wait and spent 1.1% of one core, and that verdict carried
# an instruction to raise a budget #354 explicitly refuses. Every other test in
# this tree passed, because nothing tests a fixture's own arithmetic.
#
# The cases are RECORDS rather than processes, and that is the second lesson of
# the same file. The first attempt drove real stand-ins arranged to consume a
# measured amount of CPU. It worked for the verdicts that turn on presence or
# absence and could not work for the one that turns on a magnitude: the band is
# 0.35s wide and a PowerShell process's own startup costs 0.2-0.5s, so the
# instrument's overhead and the quantity under test were the same size. Three
# green runs locally, then 0.52s against a 0.50s bound on CI; and a second
# arrangement put the burn at the recent window's cutoff edge, where 0.16s of a
# measured 0.25s counted. Records take 4ms and cannot drift.
#
# What that buys beyond not flaking:
#
#   - the unsampleable-CPU branch is testable at all, where a live process whose
#     CPU this script may not read could not be arranged;
#   - every bound is pinned on BOTH sides rather than demonstrated once from the
#     middle, which is where an `-and`/`-or` mistake of the original kind lives;
#   - precedence between the branches is assertable, including the one that
#     matters most: an unsampled reading must not be folded into a sum as a zero.
#
# What is NOT covered here, stated rather than left as an apparent omission:
# acquisition. `Win32_Process`, the parentage walk, the pid-reuse guard and the
# locked-log read are where all three real defects were, and they are exactly as
# hard to exercise wherever they live. So is the early return that reports a
# process which died mid-wait; the record below covers only the end-of-wait form.

# What the serving wait says when it gives up.
#
# A FUNCTION rather than a literal at the throw site, because a self-test cannot
# reach `Wait-ForNodeServing`: that is defined inside the run body, and `-SelfTest`
# exits well before the script gets there. Pulling the message out is what makes
# it addressable at all -- the same split this file already made for the verdict,
# and for the same reason.
#
# The wording is load-bearing in BOTH directions, which is why it is tested:
#
#   * it must say the wait was for SERVING, the fact `compile node ready`
#     actually reports (`Core/ReadinessMarker.hpp`, whose `ReadinessFact` has no
#     `Bound` enumerator on purpose);
#   * it must NOT claim a bind failure, which is what it said before #652 and
#     which sent whoever read it to check a port that is open and answering.
#
# And it must still MENTION that the port is bound, because that is the sentence
# telling the reader an open port is not evidence the wait succeeded. So "does
# not mention bind" is the wrong assertion and would fail the correct message;
# what is forbidden is the CLAIM, not the word.
#
# @param name the node whose wait gave up
function Get-NodeNotServingMessage([string]$name) {
    "$name never reported serving. That marker is logged after the port is bound and accepting, so the port being open says nothing about this wait; the stage not reached is between the accept start and the ready line."
}

# The words a node's ready line carries when it runs no worker (`--slots=0`, #206).
#
# The node builds that line in `main.cpp` from `ReadinessMarkerText(ReadinessMarker::CompileNode)`
# followed by `Node::WorkerReadinessPhrase` (`NodeConfig.cpp`), whose no-worker answer is exactly
# these bytes. This is the ONE place the fixture spells them: reword the node's phrase and
# this is the line to follow, and the self-test's no-worker case goes red until it is.
$NoWorkerReadyPhrase = "running no worker"

# Whether to wait for a node's toolchain survey, decided from its ready line and from
# what the fixture started the node to be (#206).
#
# **A pure function over those two**, so the self-test drives every arm; the waits only
# acquire the line. It exists because the survey wait cannot tell "no survey is coming"
# from "the survey stalled": a scheduler started with `--slots=0` never logs a fingerprint,
# and waiting on one ended 120 s later as `VERDICT: BLOCKED -- the signature of a hang`
# about a process that had nothing to do. A confident wrong verdict is worse than none.
# Asked here instead, right after READY, a node that runs a worker the fixture did not
# expect -- or runs none when it did -- is a MISMATCH, named at the READY bound with both
# sides of it, because no amount of waiting reconciles a fixture with a configuration.

# @param readyLine the node's ready line as it logged it

        # naming this marker a bind is the mistake this fixture was making.

        # wait covers a startup sequence with no cadence to measure silence against,
        # so it gets `0` -- its ceiling is its only bound, and that is stated here

        # Each node is started and waited for BEFORE the next one, and that is a
        # deliberate reduction in what this fixture asks of the machine. A bare
        # `--toolchain` makes a node compute a fingerprint by walking the include tree
        # the compiler owns, which is seconds when warm and much longer cold; two of
        # those racing on a two-core CI runner exceeded the budget and the fixture
        # failed having never reached a compile. (Measured before #1656, when cl still
        # walked its toolset and SDK; cl walks nothing now, a GNU driver still walks.)
        #
        # Serialising costs nothing this test is about. The collision it exists to
        # catch happens when two workers COMPILE at once, which is arranged below --
        # not when they start.
        #
        # What that serialisation is asked OF matters, and #365 silently took it
        # away. It used to rest on "compile node ready", which then meant SURVEYED --
        # a node fingerprinted before it bound. Since #365 a node binds and serves
        # first, so that same line means SERVING and no longer covers the survey at
        # all; every node reached it in about a second, and all three walked the same
        # include tree AT ONCE. (It means serving rather than merely "bound", which is
        # #652 -- the distinction does not change this paragraph's conclusion, and
        # getting it wrong here is what put a bind in the failure message below.) The rate
        # measured on the clangcl runner fell to 2-5 file/s against the ~30 file/s
        # #354 measured with one walker, the 600 s budget #428 had just moved here
        # was blown at 5136 files, and an unrelated PR was ejected from the merge
        # queue for it. Waiting on the survey is what the paragraph above always
        # meant; it now has to say so explicitly, because the line it used to rely
        # on no longer carries it.
        #
        # Both waits are kept, and separately: serving and surveying are different
        # stages with different costs, and a fixture that folds them cannot say which
        # one stalled.
        #
        # **That serialisation is intact, and #1157 is NOT a second instance of #365.**
        # Asked and answered rather than assumed, because the ticket offered it as one
        # of two possibilities and guessing is how the previous two budgets were set.
        # On the run that filed it, one walker:
        #
        #   * the scheduler's survey took 0 s -- its toolchain is pinned, so
        #     `DiscoverToolchainEntries` gives the entry a fingerprint and the probe is
        #     skipped;
        #   * workerA reached `compile node ready` in 0 s and then walked while nothing
        #     else did: workerB is not STARTED until the wait below returns;
        #   * `--toolchain` REPLACES machine discovery rather than adding to it
        #     (`ToolchainSource::OperatorNamed`), so a worker surveys exactly one
        #     toolchain and not every compiler on the runner;
        #   * the node's progress lines were a single monotonic series, 161 -> 4931 of
        #     5136, with no second series interleaved -- one `ToolchainHashProgress`;
        #   * and the test is `RUN_SERIAL`.
        #
        # So it is the other possibility: one walker now costs more than the ceiling on
        # that runner. What the ceiling is set from, and why it is no longer the thing
        # that catches a wedge, is at `$SurveySeconds` near the top of this file.
        #
        # Each node is a cluster of one with a worker of its own: consensus on its own
        # loopback port, no discovery beacon on the port every fixture shares, and its own

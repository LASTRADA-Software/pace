# `vendor-verbatim` must be SEEN to tell a declared local change from an accidental edit.
#
# The check had no selftest. It refused an edit made in place, and a regeneration of the
# manifest silenced that refusal for ANY edit, declared or not (found while landing #1375's
# local change, which is the first one this tree has). So what is pinned here is mostly the
# half that did not exist: a regeneration carries each file's UPSTREAM hash forward rather than
# blessing the new bytes, and a file that differs from upstream must be named by a row of
# VENDOR.md's "Local changes" table.
#
# Which case pins which half:
#
#   clean, declared, declaredWithLink, resyncClears   the ACCEPTING direction
#   editedNotRegenerated                              the original refusal: bytes differ from the manifest
#   blessedByRegeneration                             THE defect: an edit plus a regeneration, undeclared
#   declaredInProse                                   a path in prose declares nothing; only table rows do
#   newFile                                           a file upstream does not have is a local change too
#   staleDeclaration, revertedChange                  a row naming a file that is upstream's is refused
#   editedTwice                                       the upstream hash survives a second regeneration
#   noManifestToCarry, malformed, noHeading, vacuous  every way of having nothing to compare refuses
#   secondRoot{Seen,Edited,Regenerated,Declared}      a SECOND root is hashed and declared like the first
#   resyncOneRoot                                     a re-sync of one root leaves another's local change
#   resyncNamesNoRoot, resyncNamesUnknownRoot         a re-sync that does not say which root refuses
#   emptySecondRoot, rootDropped                      a root with nothing in it, a manifest line under none
#
# The second-root cases are what make the check's generalisation to every root in
# scripts/lib/third-party-roots.txt (#178) something watched rather than claimed. Each was run
# against a mutant of the check, and reddened exactly where it should: walking the first root only
# fails secondRoot{Seen,Edited,Regenerated,Declared}, emptySecondRoot and rootDropped; a RESYNC that
# blesses every root fails resyncOneRoot; dropping the per-root emptiness refusal fails
# emptySecondRoot (and vacuous, which then refuses for another reason); dropping the
# outside-every-root report fails rootDropped; reading declarations under `vendor/endo/` only fails
# secondRootDeclared.

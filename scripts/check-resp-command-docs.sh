# Every RESP verb fastcached serves is documented, and every verb the docs claim is
# served exists.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# `RedisResp.hpp` has said for a long time that `CommandTable` is the source of truth
# "if this prose drifts" -- which is a sentence, not a reader, so the prose drifted.
# Measured at the commit that added this check, against a live daemon:
#
#   * `docs/commands/redis/unsupported.md` said pub/sub, `MULTI`/`EXEC`/`WATCH`,
#     sets and streams were unimplemented. Pub/sub (5 verbs), transactions (5) and
#     streams (15) are all served, and so are 7 of the set verbs -- including
#     `SADD` and `SMEMBERS`, which that page named as examples of the absence.
#   * `docs/protocols/redis-resp.md` said `HELLO 3` answers `-NOPROTO` and `COMMAND`
#     always answers `*0`. A probe returns a RESP3 map with `proto:3`, and
#     `COMMAND COUNT` returns `:66`.
#   * Six pages said RESP3 was not supported. One -- the architecture diagram --
#     said it was. The docs disagreed with each other for months.
#
# None of that is a coding mistake and none of it could fail: a claim with no reader
# cannot. So the supported list is DERIVED from the table and checked against it.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, stated rather than left to be discovered
#
#   * It says nothing about the per-command pages under `docs/commands/redis/`.
#     Only 17 of the verbs have one, and demanding a page per verb would refuse the
#     tree as it stands rather than describing a rule anybody agreed to. A missing
#     page is a gap in coverage; a missing TABLE ROW is a false statement about
#     what the server answers, which is the thing worth failing a build over.
#   * It reads the SUPPORTED table only. `unsupported.md` is prose about families
#     and is deliberately not machine-checked -- a scan over it could only compare
#     verb spellings inside sentences, and a sentence is not a list.
#   * It does not check semantics. A row saying `GET` returns an integer would pass.
#
# ## Constraints
#
# bash 3.2 (macOS ships a 2007 `/bin/bash` and this runs in the default ctest set):
# no `mapfile`, `declare -A`, `${var^^}` or `local -n`. `fail` is unconditional
# rather than guarded on `BASHPID`, which is bash 4.0+.

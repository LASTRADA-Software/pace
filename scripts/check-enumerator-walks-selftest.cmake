# Drives `check-enumerator-walks.cmake` over staged trees, in both directions.
#
# **Both directions, because only one of them is usually tested.** A self-test that plants a
# violation and watches the check object proves the refusing half and says nothing about the
# accepting half -- and a guard nobody has watched ACCEPT is not known to work either. The
# cases below therefore include the shape the check must NOT refuse: a bounds check on a
# value off a wire, `static_cast<std::size_t>(raw) >= EnumeratorCount<E>`, which appears six
# times in the real tree and is correct every time.
#
# Verdicts are read from the check's OUTPUT and not from its exit status, and the output is
# FLATTENED before matching: CMake word-wraps its diagnostics at a column that depends on the
# scratch path's length, so a phrase grepped for can exist in the output and in no single
# line of it.
#
# **BOTH enumeration modes are exercised, and each case asserts which one it ran in.** A
# staged tree is an untracked scratch directory, so `git ls-files` there returns nothing and
# the check falls through to its directory walk -- which is NOT the mode CI uses. This tree
# has already paid for that exact shape: six green self-test cases exercised a directory-walk
# fallback while CI exercised git, so the mode under test was not the mode in use and the
# guard passed because it was testing something else. A case whose name ends in `Git` is
# `git init`-ed and `git add`-ed so the check takes its git path, and every case's expected
# phrase names the mode, so a case silently changing modes fails rather than passing.

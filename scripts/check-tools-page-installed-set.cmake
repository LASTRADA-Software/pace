# The Tools page names exactly the binaries a user installs -- no more, no fewer.
#
# `docs/tools/index.md` is the overview a reader lands on to find out what this
# project gives them to run. What belongs there is the INSTALLED set: the targets
# carrying an `install()` rule, the ones a `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.pkg` or `.msi`
# actually puts on a machine. Everything else under `src/apps/` is contributor
# tooling that is built by CI and shipped to nobody.
#
# Nothing connected the two. `compile-cache-testclient` -- `FASTCACHED_BUILD_TESTCLIENT`
# OFF by default, no `install()` rule, in no package -- sat on that page as the third
# peer of `pace-cc` and `pace-node` and was published to users at
# `/fastcached/tools/compile-cache-testclient/` for months
# ([#1030](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1030)). It was moved
# to `Internals`, where its sibling `pace-bench` already lived. This is the guard
# that was missing, filed as
# [#1035](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1035).
#
# ## Why a sentence was not enough
#
# The page now STATES the relation in its own opening line:
#
#   > The project ships three executables, and these are all of them: every target
#   > carrying an `install()` rule appears below.
#
# A sentence is not a check. A fifth internal tool documented there contradicts that
# sentence with nothing to say so -- which is exactly how the fourth one got in, and
# it is this repository's recurring shape: a rule written down in the files that obey
# it, reaching no file that does not.
#
# ## Both directions, because they are different mistakes
#
#   * **Documented but not installed** is the #1030 defect: a contributor harness
#     advertised beside the product. The reader is told to run something no package
#     contains.
#   * **Installed but not documented** is the mirror: a binary users get and cannot
#     find. It is the quieter of the two and nothing else in the tree would report it.
#
# They have different fixes, so they are reported separately rather than as one count.
#
# ## The installed set is DERIVED, twice over
#
# The app directories come from `FASTCACHED_APPS` in `src/apps/CMakeLists.txt` -- the
# table that gates what is built -- and whether each is installed comes from that app's
# own `CMakeLists.txt`. Neither is restated here. A second list is not a cross-check,
# it is a second thing to be wrong, and it drifts silently in the direction of agreeing
# with whatever it was copied from.
#
# That two-step matters: the app table alone cannot answer this question. It lists all
# five apps including the two that ship to nobody, and its `default` column is about
# whether a target BUILDS, not whether it INSTALLS. `compile-cache-testclient` is OFF
# by default AND uninstalled; a target could be ON by default and still uninstalled.
# Only the `install()` rule settles it.
#
# ## It refuses when it matches nothing
#
# Every scan here fails CLOSED. Two empty lists agree perfectly, so a scan whose file
# moved would otherwise report a clean tree in exactly the voice of a correct one --
# `node-config-reference` already refuses that way, for the same reason
# ([#492](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/492): a list is exact
# about what it knows and silent about what it does not, and silence reads identically
# to complete coverage).
#
# ## The subject is the page's `##` sections, NOT the nav
#
# This is the one a re-implementer gets wrong, so it is written down rather than left
# to be rediscovered.
#
# `pace-kv` is installed and has NO page of its own under `Tools` -- the overview's
# section for it routes to the Quickstart. So the `Tools` nav in `mkdocs.yml` lists three
# pages plus an overview, while the installed set is four. A nav-derived check computes
# 3 != 4 and REFUSES A CORRECT TREE.
#
# Those two figures were "two" and "three" until `pacectl` joined both the app
# table and the nav (#1439). The check reads both sides and was right throughout; only
# this sentence rotted, which is what a hand-written number describing a derived set
# does. The ARGUMENT is what this paragraph is for -- the nav will always be one short
# of the installed set while `pace-kv` has no page -- so read the figures as the
# illustration and the inequality as the claim.
#
# The overview page's `##` sections are the thing that actually claims to enumerate the
# product. Those are the subject.
#
# ## Read without building a list of lines
#
# `docs/tools/index.md` is full of `[` and `]` -- markdown links and tables -- and a
# CMake list built by splitting its lines merges elements at every unbalanced bracket.
# This repository has measured that class of reader going SILENTLY wrong twice
# (`net-boundary` passed over a real cross-boundary include; `psk-signing-seam`, retired
# since, counted 15 calls as 14 and still passed).
#
# And the usual remedy is wrong here. Blanking `[`/`]` before splitting is what broke
# `check-tsan-scope`, because a Catch2 tag IS `[async]` -- the brackets were the data.
# So this walks with `FIND`/`SUBSTRING` and never puts a line into a list at all. Only
# the extracted NAMES become list elements, and a target name has no separator in it.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`: it reads files, compares strings and reports. See
# `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports failure through its
# OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-tools-page-installed-set.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

# `AGENT.md` stays within the budget in `scripts/agent-md-budget.txt`.
#
# **The ARGUMENT lives in that file, not here** -- why there are two measures and
# why either alone is gameable, why `max-bullet-lines` is the primary one, why
# `total-lines` is an equality rather than a ceiling, and why `.agent/rules/*.md`
# is deliberately unbudgeted. That is `check-test-loops-backlog.txt`'s split
# between a ratchet's data file and the check that reads it, and stating it in
# both places would be the second-source-of-truth defect this check exists to
# refuse, committed by the check itself.
#
# What is here is the MECHANISM, and the two things a reader of this file needs
# that the budget file cannot give them: what a bullet's lines are, and what this
# check cannot see.
#
# One rule of the budget's is repeated here because the code below implements it
# and would otherwise read as arbitrary: the figures live in `agent-md-budget.txt`
# alone, so this check REFUSES `total-lines` appearing in `AGENT.md` other than
# behind a `#`. A size claim in the file whose size it describes is a second
# source of truth; `#1610` is an issue reference rather than a claim.
#
# ## What this does NOT cover, stated because a reader will over-apply it
#
#   * It does not budget `.agent/rules/*.md`, deliberately and permanently.
#     AGENT.md says reasoning there can be as long as it needs to be, so
#     budgeting them would contradict the rule this enforces and push derivations
#     back into the file this keeps small.
#   * It does not judge whether a bullet is a good tripwire, only how long it is.
#     `ctest -R rulebook-tripwires` is the check that asks whether a rule has one
#     at all.
#   * A bullet can satisfy the ceiling and still be derivation, by being wrapped
#     tighter. Nothing mechanical catches that.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-agent-md-budget.sh [<repo-root>]
#   bash scripts/check-agent-md-budget.sh --self-test
#
# Exit: 0 clean, 1 a rule was broken, 2 usage.

# The measuring pass. One awk over AGENT.md, no shell loop over lines: this file
# is dense with `|` inside tables and `[#876](...)`, and every shell splitting
# idiom in this repository has been bitten by one or the other.
#
# A bullet's LINES are its own -- the `- ` line plus the blank and indented lines
# under it, stopping at the first line that is neither. That boundary is not
# cosmetic: a standalone PARAGRAPH after a bullet (AGENT.md has one, the
# backwards-compatibility policy) belongs to no bullet, and a rule that ran to the
# next bullet attributed 12 of its lines to the tripwire above it and reported a
# 14-line bullet that is two lines long.
#
# NOTE: no apostrophes anywhere in this block -- it is a single-quoted shell

NotCovered='  This check measures HOW LONG a rulebook bullet is, nothing else.
  It does NOT budget .agent/rules/*.md -- deliberately and permanently, because
  AGENT.md says reasoning there can be as long as it needs to be, and budgeting
  those files would push derivations back into the file this keeps small.
  It does NOT judge whether a bullet is a good tripwire (that is
  `ctest -R rulebook-tripwires`), and a bullet wrapped tighter can satisfy the
  ceiling and still be derivation -- nothing enforces AGENT.md`s wrap, so lines
  are a proxy for words rather than a measure of them.
  `max-bullet-lines` governs `## The rulebook` alone; `total-lines` ratchets the
  WHOLE file, so growth outside the rulebook is refused by a measure the
  per-bullet ceiling cannot help you meet.'

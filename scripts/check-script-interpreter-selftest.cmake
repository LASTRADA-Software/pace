# `script-interpreter` watched refusing, against synthesised registration files.
#
# ## Why both directions, and why the control is not decoration
#
# #379's acceptance asks for the check shown refusing a bare-`bash` registration
# AND shown passing on the converted tree. The second half is the one that is
# easy to skip and easy to fake: a check that refuses everything also refuses a
# bare `bash`, and only a control that must PASS separates a guard from a
# tripwire.
#
# The control is the REAL `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt`, copied unmodified. A
# synthesised minimal file would let a case pass by testing a simplified world --
# and the site this check exists for, `set(_smoke_driver ...)`, is exactly the
# kind of thing a hand-written fixture would not have thought to include.
#
# ## The five refusals, and why each is here
#
#   bare        a `COMMAND bash` registration -- #379's own subject
#   literal     a `COMMAND /bin/bash` -- correct today, broken on Windows the day
#               a row moves, so the check pins the VARIABLE and not the value
#   nointerp    `COMMAND "x.sh"` with no interpreter token at all. It must say
#               THAT rather than report `COMMAND` as the interpreter: naming the
#               wrong half of a real defect is #791, and it sends a maintainer to
#               look for something that is not there
#   nodef       the `PACE_BASH` definition removed. Every site then expands
#               to no interpreter, the scripts still RUN from their shebang, and
#               every test stays green while the thing this pins is unpinned --
#               a green suite proving nothing
#   empty       no script registrations match at all. Two empty lists agree
#               perfectly, so an emptiness refusal is what keeps a scan that
#               stopped matching from reporting success
#
# **Every arm asserts the finding COUNT.** A defect that reports as several
# findings is the check miscounting its own output (#796), and this file's subject
# has already done it once: a raw `;` in a violation string made one finding print
# and count as two.

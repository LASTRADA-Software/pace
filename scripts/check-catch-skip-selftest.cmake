# `catch-skip-return-code` must be SEEN to fail, and on every direction it claims.
#
# The check exists because a registration that omits `SKIP_RETURN_CODE` scores every
# Catch2 skip as a FAILURE. A guard for that is worth nothing until it has been
# watched refusing something, and worth less than nothing if it refuses everything --
# so this drives the real check against synthetic source trees and asserts each
# verdict separately rather than inverting one run with `WILL_FAIL`.
#
# The trees are built here rather than committed, because a fixture CMakeLists holding
# a deliberately-bare `catch_discover_tests` would be a violation of the very rule
# under test, and excluding it would put a hole in the thing being proved.
#
# Six cases, and the last two are the ones that would otherwise rot quietly:
#
#   correct       a registration carrying the property PASSES -- an always-failing
#                 check is as useless as an always-passing one
#   bare          a registration without it FAILS, and NAMES the file
#   wrong-value   `SKIP_RETURN_CODE 77` FAILS. 77 is the GNU convention the
#                 script-driven tests use; Catch2 exits 4 and nothing else, so a
#                 present-but-wrong value looks correct in a diff, satisfies any
#                 "is the property there" scan, and still scores skips as failures
#   continued     the property on a CONTINUATION line PASSES. Legal CMake, and a
#                 line-at-a-time scan would call it a violation
#   none          a tree with no registrations at all FAILS as a broken scan, never
#                 passes as a clean tree
#   excluded      a registration under a build directory is IGNORED -- the first
#                 version of this check walked into `_deps/catch2-src` and reported
#                 vendored third-party code nobody here can edit
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check
# reports failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# A `directory walk` expectation below names the mode CLASS and not which of its two reasons
# ran. Since #1485 a walk says whether there was no index at all or whether the index named no
# matching file, and which one a staged tree gets depends on where the scratch directory sits --
# a tree with no `.git` of its own is still inside a work tree whenever `CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`
# is. The git-against-walk distinction these cases exist for is unaffected; the two reasons are
# pinned in `check-tracked-files-selftest.cmake`, which controls the git probe instead of
# inheriting it.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-catch-skip-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

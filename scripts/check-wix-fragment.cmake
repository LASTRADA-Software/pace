# The WiX patch fragment must be well-formed XML, and the rule that breaks it is
# one nobody has in mind while writing a comment.
#
# **An XML comment may not contain a double hyphen.** Not at the end, not in the
# middle, not inside backticks: `--` is forbidden anywhere between `<!--` and
# `-->`. That collides head-on with how this repository writes comments, because
# every flag it documents is spelled with two of them -- `--seed-config`,
# `--install-service`, `--advertise` -- and an em-dash typed as `--` does it too.
#
# Measured: one comment naming `--seed-config` in packaging/windows/service-actions.xml
# took the `Package (Windows .msi)` job red with a parse error naming the LINE and
# not the reason, on a change whose subject was a config file. That job builds an
# MSI, runs only on a Windows runner, and is one of the slowest in the matrix -- so
# the feedback loop for a typo in a comment was a full CI cycle.
#
# This check needs no XML library, no compiler and no Windows: it walks the comment
# regions itself and refuses a `--` inside one. That is deliberately NARROWER than
# validating the document. Full validation would need a parser CMake does not have,
# and this is the rule that actually bit; a broader check nobody can run locally is
# the problem it replaces, not a fix for it.
#
# What it does NOT see, stated rather than left to be discovered: unbalanced tags,
# a bad attribute, an unescaped `&`. The Windows job remains the only thing that
# validates the document. This closes the one failure mode that is invisible while
# reading and cheap to make.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-wix-fragment.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every comment is legal. 1 = at least one is not.

# Runs `error-popup-product-canary` with and without the suppression variable and requires
# the product policy in BOTH directions (#1389): a failed assert routed to a file when the
# variable is present, and left on the dialog when it is absent.
#
# Both, because either alone is satisfied by a wrong policy: a canary that suppressed
# unconditionally passes the first run, and one that never suppressed passes the second.
#
# The ctest registration running this carries the variable itself, like every test, so the
# "absent" run removes it explicitly -- asserted from the canary's answer, not assumed.

# Usage: cmake -DCANARY=<path> -DVARIABLE=<name> -P scripts/error-popup-product-gate.cmake

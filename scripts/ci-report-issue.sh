# Open an issue, or comment on the one that already carries this exact title.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci-report-issue.sh <title> <bodyFile> [label ...]
#
# Reads `GH_TOKEN` and `GH_REPO` from the environment, like every other `gh` call
# in this repository's workflows. Prints what it did; exits non-zero when it
# could not tell whether the issue already existed, which is the one outcome that
# must never be quietly treated as "no match".
#
# ## Why the lookup is a LIST and not a SEARCH
#
# `gh issue list --search` goes through GitHub's issue search INDEX, which lags
# creation by seconds to minutes -- so two failures inside that window each find
# nothing and each open an issue, which is the noise a de-duplicating reporter
# exists to avoid. A plain `gh issue list` reads the repository's issue
# connection directly, so the second failure sees what the first just opened.
# That connection is GRAPHQL rather than REST, which matters only for which
# rate-limit budget a reader chasing a failure here should look at.
#
# The listing is deliberately NOT narrowed by the labels this script applies.
# Narrowing by them makes de-duplication depend on labels nobody promised to
# keep -- this script invites a human to touch them by applying
# `status/needs-triage`, and a triager re-areaing the report would make the next
# failure miss the open issue and open a second one. The exact title decides it;
# the labels are for the humans.
#
# ## The failure directions that are not symmetric
#
# A lookup that FAILED and a lookup that found NOTHING are different findings,
# and the obvious spelling renders them identically: `found="$(gh ... || true)"`
# turns an API error, a mangled `--jq` program and a real absence into one empty
# string, and the surrounding code then opens a duplicate issue every single run.
# `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` records two instruments that invented
# their subject exactly this way. So the exit status of the query is checked
# before its output is read, and a query that did not answer is fatal.
#
# A listing that came back AT its cap is a third state: it is a real answer about
# a set that is not the whole set. It warns rather than failing, because opening
# a second copy of a report is a smaller harm than never reporting -- but it says
# so, so a duplicate is explicable rather than mysterious.
#
# ## Not this repository's only copy, deliberately, for now
#
# `.github/workflows/build.yml`'s clang-tidy job carries an inline copy of this
# logic for the master-sweep report it opens. Folding it into this script is
# [#717](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/pace/issues/717) rather than
# part of #684: that step lives inside a REQUIRED context, it is reachable only
# on a master push that has already failed, and editing it to remove a
# duplication would put a required job's YAML at risk for no gain this change
# needs. The duplication is recorded rather than left to be discovered.

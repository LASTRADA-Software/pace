# Test-name hygiene: fail if a Catch2 case is named something the CTest
# registration cannot pass back to the runner.
#
# `catch_discover_tests` registers each case as
# `add_test(NAME <case> COMMAND <exe> <case>)`, so the name is handed to Catch2
# as a command-line ARGUMENT. Catch2 parses its arguments before it parses test
# specs, so a name beginning with `-` is read as an option:
#
#   * `--help wins over whatever follows it` — Catch2 recognises `--help`,
#     prints its usage and exits 0. CTest reports a PASS for a case that never
#     ran. That is the shape this repository keeps a list about: nothing fails,
#     and the thing an operator was told is covered is not.
#   * `--cache-dir gives the node an on-disk tier` — Catch2 does not recognise
#     it, prints `Unrecognised token` and exits non-zero. CTest reports a
#     failure the case does not have, and it passes when run by hand, which is
#     the worst way to spend an afternoon.
#
# Both were live in this tree. The first had been silently not running since it

# Runs as `cmake -P`, for the reasons check-repository-hygiene.cmake gives at

# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-test-names.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every case name was READ and survives the round trip. 1 = one
# does not, OR one could not be read at all -- a case whose name this file cannot
# extract is a case it does not check, which is not a pass (#1261).

# Every Catch2 macro that names a case -- a TABLE, and a refusal for the ones it
# does not name.
#
# This was four spellings in an alternation, under a comment saying "all four, not
# just the one this tree happens to use today". Catch2 declares SIXTEEN, so the
# sentence was true about the list and false about Catch2:
# `TEMPLATE_TEST_CASE_METHOD` and `SCENARIO_METHOD` were both absent, and neither
# is exotic. The list being short is not what made that a defect -- a list is
# exact about what it knows and SILENT about what it does not, and silence here
# reads identically to complete coverage (#1261).
#
# So the pattern captures the IDENTIFIER and membership is asked of this table,
# which buys two things an alternation cannot:
#
#   * no prefix ordering to get right. `(TEST_CASE|TEST_CASE_METHOD)` against
#     `TEST_CASE_METHOD(` depends on the regex engine backtracking out of the
#     first alternative, which is a property of CMake's engine rather than of this
#     rule. Capturing the whole identifier asks no such question.
#   * a macro NOT in this table whose name still carries `TEST_CASE` or
#     `SCENARIO` is refused BY NAME rather than skipped, so the next Catch2
#     spelling -- or the next local wrapper around one -- arrives as a refusal
#     that says what to do instead of as a case nobody checks.
#
# The name is the first string LITERAL of the invocation for every row: where the
# case name is not the first argument (`TEST_CASE_METHOD` takes a fixture type,
# `METHOD_AS_TEST_CASE` a method, `REGISTER_TEST_CASE` a function) the arguments
# ahead of it are never string literals, so there is nothing for the match to
# reach by mistake.

# Duplicated case names, and the ONE pair that is allowed (#729).

# per case, so two cases sharing a name produce two ctest entries that each run
# the binary filtered by that name -- and Catch2 matches BOTH cases for either
# entry. Nothing is skipped, which is why this reads as harmless and is not:
#
#   * one defect surfaces as TWO red ctest entries, and neither names the case
#     that actually failed;
#   * `ctest -R "^<name>$"` cannot select one of the pair, so a bisect or a
#     targeted re-run silently runs both;
#   * per-case timings and the `--repeat` flake-hunting workflows are attributed

# `RefuseWithoutCounter` shape this tree uses elsewhere: a row carries its
# REASON, so an allowed duplicate cannot be spelled the same way as a forgotten
# one. And a row that has STOPPED describing a duplicate is refused rather than
# ignored -- an exemption list that can rot silently is a second source of truth,
# and the one thing worse than no exemption is one nobody has to keep true.

# `src/tests/`'s `CatchSkipCanary.cpp`, `ErrorPopupCanary.cpp` and
# `OffThreadAssertionCanary.cpp`. Some of those sit outside the convention on
# purpose -- a canary is not a test of the tree -- but a case in one is registered
# by `catch_discover_tests` exactly like any other, so it can collide with a name
# elsewhere and it can begin with a dash. Being deliberately outside the naming
# convention is not being outside the round trip (#1261).
#
# Headers too: nothing stops a case being declared in one, and "nothing stops it"

# Through `pace_tracked_files`, which is this tree's one answer to HOW a check
# finds its file set, and not a raw `file(GLOB_RECURSE)`. The difference only became

# to carry, while every `.cpp` and `.hpp` under `src/` catches an untracked WIP file,
# a generated header or an editor's copy -- so a raw glob would enforce one rule on a

# Does `message(FATAL_ERROR)` in `cmake -P` actually reach ctest as a non-zero
# exit code, on THIS machine, with THIS CMake?
#
# ## Why this is measured rather than remembered
#
# `check-script-check-signals.cmake` and `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md`
# both used to state, as a measurement with versions attached, that it prints
# `CMake Error ...` and exits **0** on CMake 3.28 -- this project's declared
# minimum -- which was the sole stated reason thirteen `cmake -P` hygiene checks
# carry `FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`. It does not reproduce anywhere it has been
# looked for: two machines in #565, and a third pass across six CMake versions
# and six script shapes, all reading exit **1**.
#
# A claim in that form is the one this repository treats as authoritative, so a
# correction that is itself only a sentence would sit in exactly the position the
# wrong sentence sat in. This asks the question instead, on every platform CI
# builds, on every run -- which is the difference between a citation and a
# measurement, and it is cheap: three `cmake -P` invocations that compile
# nothing.
#
# ## What it asserts, and the controls that make the answer mean something
#
# The subject is one reading and it is worth nothing alone: a harness that
# reported 1 for everything would pass the subject and prove nothing. So two
# controls bracket it -- a child that SUCCEEDS must read 0, and a child pointed
# at a script that does not exist must read non-zero. That is the rule from
# `.agent/rules/testing.md` about a signal that cannot be false in the failing
# case, and it is the rule that caught the first attempt at this very
# measurement: a sweep across six CMake versions reported exit 0 for five of them
# because the shell read `$?` after a command substitution had already run.
#
# ## What a red one MEANS
#
# Not that this file is broken. It means the note's condition has been found: on
# this platform a `cmake -P` check that objects loudly still exits 0, so
# `FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION` is the only thing standing between thirteen hygiene
# checks and reporting PASSED whatever they found. Record the platform and the
# CMake version here; do not delete the property.
#
# ## The three arms are this same file
#
# Re-invoked with `-DPACE_FATAL_EXIT_CHILD=`, rather than written to a
# scratch directory: script mode has no binary directory, and `$ENV{TMPDIR}` is
# `TEMP` on Windows. One file, no temporaries, identical on every platform.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake [-DPACE_FATAL_EXIT_READINGS=<subject>;<ok>;<missing>] \
#         -P scripts/check-fatal-error-exit.cmake
#
#   PACE_FATAL_EXIT_READINGS  stage the three readings instead of measuring
#                                   them, so the VERDICT can be driven against a
#                                   record. `check-fatal-error-exit-selftest`
#                                   uses it; nothing else should.
#
# Exit codes: whatever CMake gives it. The verdict is the presence of
# `CMake Error` in the output -- which is this file obeying the rule it exists to
# keep honest, and would remain correct even if its own answer were the red one.

# Every script-driven test names its interpreter, and names it the same way.
#
# ## The rule this gives an executor to
#
# `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` requires every script `ctest` runs to work
# on **bash 3.2** -- macOS ships a 2007 `/bin/bash` and a script in the default
# set runs on every platform CI builds. The rule was added after a `mapfile` took
# `merge-queue-contexts` red on `macOS-clang-release`.
#
# ## MEASURED, because #379's premise turned out to be false
#
# #379 said the macOS leg most likely proved the checks and not the constraint,
# on the ground that Homebrew's bash 5.x sits ahead of `/bin/bash` on GitHub's
# image. **It does not.** Both spellings were registered side by side and run on
# `macOS-clang-release` (PR #806, 2026-09-05):
#
#   COMMAND bash       -> /bin/bash  3.2.57(1)-release  mapfile UNSUPPORTED
#   COMMAND /bin/bash  -> /bin/bash  3.2.57(1)-release  mapfile UNSUPPORTED
#
# The same interpreter, and it is the 2007 one. The rule HAD an executor the whole
# time; nobody had checked. So this check is not repairing a hole -- it is pinning
# a property that was true by accident.
#
# That is still worth pinning, and the reason is measurable too: CMake does NOT
# resolve a bare command name at configure time. `CTestTestfile.cmake` keeps the
# literal `"bash"`, so the interpreter is chosen from `PATH` at RUN time and would
# move the day the image gains a newer bash -- which brew pulls in as a dependency
# of other formulae often enough. Naming `/bin/bash` removes a live dependency on
# PATH ordering rather than fixing a present defect.
#
# Condition on those figures: this repository's macOS job, its brew installs, on
# that date. They are a property of the image, not of the registration.
#
# `${PACE_BASH}` is `/bin/bash` everywhere but Windows, which has none and
# resolves Git for Windows' `bin/bash.exe` instead, since a WSL launcher can come first
# on its PATH (#1355). Defined once in `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt`; this asserts
# every site uses it.
#
# ## Why the SET is derived and never listed
#
# #379's body named six call sites. The tree had **thirty**, three of the
# unlisted scripts predate the ticket, and one of the thirty is not a `COMMAND`
# at all -- `sccache-smoke.sh` is reached through a `set(_smoke_driver ...)`
# variable, which is the form a reader scanning for `COMMAND bash` walks past.
# Those three are the required `sccache smoke` contexts.
#
# A lane converting the six and reporting the constraint enforced would have left
# twenty-four sites unconverted with every test green. So the set is derived here,
# at check time, from what the file actually contains: a list in a ticket, a
# comment or this script would be a second thing to be wrong, and it would go
# stale in the direction that reports success (#492, #510).
#
# ## And a site it cannot classify is REFUSED, not skipped
#
# A registration form nobody anticipated is exactly how the twenty-fourth site
# hides. Skipping one is indistinguishable from there not being one, so an
# executable reference to a `.sh` whose interpreter token this scan cannot read is
# a violation naming the line -- the answer `check-gated-jobs.sh` rule A already
# gives a classifier read in a shape it does not recognise.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-script-interpreter.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is `CMake Error` in the output, which is why
# the registration carries FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION.

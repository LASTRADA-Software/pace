# End-to-end test of PACE_AUTO_START (POSIX) — the other half of issue
# #90 from scripts/check-compile-cache-daemon-staging.cmake, which proves the
# module can STAGE a pace-kv daemon out of a mirrored release archive with
# fake, --version-only stand-ins. What that mirror test cannot reach is
# whether _fc_auto_start_fastcached actually spawns a REAL daemon that
# answers real connections — a fake shell script has no socket to accept on
# — so this drives the real, freshly built pace-kv and pace-cc
# through a real configure instead.
#
# What is asserted:
#   1. Daemon appears     — with PACE_AUTO_START=ON, PACE_CC already
#                           pointed at the real launcher, and PACE_ADDR
#                           naming a port nothing is listening on, the
#                           configure leaves a pace-kv process listening
#                           on that port when it exits — not merely staged,
#                           actually running.
#   2. Cache actually works — a real translation unit compiled through the
#                           configured launcher against that daemon reports a
#                           MISS then a HIT, i.e. this is not just "a process
#                           exists" but "the cache the module exists to
#                           provide is functioning" end to end.
#   3. No double-start     — a SECOND configure against the same address finds
#                           the daemon the first one started and does not
#                           spawn a second one (see the race-safety design in
#                           _fc_daemon_answering's own comment): the daemon's
#                           pidfile names the same PID after both configures.
#   4. Never fails a configure — every prerequisite this script itself cannot
#                           meet (no POSIX daemon path, no compiler) is a skip,
#                           not a failure, mirroring the module's own
#                           constraint.
#
# This does NOT go through PACE_AUTO_INSTALL's download path at all —
# the real pace-kv built by this project's own build is placed exactly
# where the module would have staged one, so the test exercises the SPAWN and
# PROBE logic without needing network access or a published release, which
# check-compile-cache-daemon-staging.cmake already covers separately with a
# synthetic mirror.
#
# Windows has no --daemon double-fork equivalent and this script's process
# bookkeeping (pidfile-based) is POSIX-specific; a Windows smoke test is left
# as follow-up work rather than attempted here, the same scoping
# check-compile-cache-install.cmake and check-compile-cache-autoinstall.cmake
# already use for their own sandboxes.
#
# Usage:
#   check-compile-cache-daemon-start.sh --pace-kv <path> --launcher <path>
#                                        --compiler <cxx> --source-dir <repo>
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every assertion held; 1 = a failure; 77 = a runtime
# prerequisite was missing (skip).

# The shared helpers: `fail`, `free_port` and `wait_for_port`, one copy for every

#
#   * `free_port` had no issued-port ledger. Only one port is drawn here today,
#     so it was latent rather than wrong -- and latent-because-of-the-caller is
#     how the next caller inherits a bug.
#   * `wait_for_port` checked NO liveness at all, so a daemon that died at
#     `bind()` was reported as `never answered on port N` after the full bound
#     had burned. A slow machine and a dead process are fixed in different
#     places and that message cannot tell them apart, which is the thing
#     `.agent/rules/testing.md` asks a bounded wait to do.

# TLS smoke test (POSIX). Start pace-kv with TLS terminated using the
# checked-in self-signed cert, connect with `openssl s_client`, send a RESP
# PING, and assert the daemon answers +PONG over the encrypted channel.
#
# Usage:
#   tls-smoke.sh --pace-kv <path> --cert <pem> --key <pem> [--port <n>]
#
# Exit codes: 0 = +PONG over TLS; 1 = ran but no PONG; 77 = a runtime
# prerequisite (openssl / pace-kv / cert) was missing — treated as a skip.
#
# The port is DRAWN per run unless one is passed. It used to be the constant
# `11811` — the same constant `tls-smoke.ps1` carried, so the two halves of one
# fixture could not even run side by side — and `RUN_SERIAL` is no defence
# against a second worktree or a daemon left behind by a run that missed its
# cleanup (#1284). This is the arm Linux CI runs.

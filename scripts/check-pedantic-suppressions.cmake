# `PEDANTIC_COMPILER_WERROR` decides whether warnings are FATAL. It may not decide
# which warnings EXIST.
#
# `cmake/portable/PedanticCompiler.cmake` adds `-pedantic` under
# `PEDANTIC_COMPILER`, and used to add the suppressions that flag makes necessary
# -- `-Wno-c2y-extensions`, `-Wno-c++20-extensions`, `-Wno-missing-declarations`,
# `-Wno-class-memaccess` -- under `PEDANTIC_COMPILER_WERROR`. Two conditions over
# one concern, so the four presets that inherit `PEDANTIC_COMPILER=ON` from `base`
# without turning `WERROR` on -- `clang-coverage`, `clang-asan-ubsan`, `clang-tsan`,
# `clang-tracy` -- got the warnings and none of the suppressions
# ([#611](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/611)).
#
# Measured on 0db96dc8 before the fix, each preset in its OWN fresh build directory
# with `/usr/bin/clang++` pinned by absolute path and no compiler-cache launcher:
# **7049 `-Wc2y-extensions` warnings across 195 translation units, identically in
# all four**, every one of them `'__COUNTER__' is a C2y extension` from Catch2's
# `TEST_CASE`. That is the diagnostic
# [#454](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/454) reported and
# could not explain.
#
# ## Why this is a check and not a comment
#
# The defect is invisible in every direction somebody would look. It breaks no
# build: those four presets have `WERROR` off, so 7049 warnings are 7049 warnings
# and the build exits 0. It does not reproduce in the preset people run, because
# `clang-debug` has `WERROR` on and therefore does get the suppressions. And it
# surfaces as a clang-tidy finding in a build directory somebody reused across
# presets, which reads as a stale cache rather than as a rule -- which is exactly
# how #454 came to be believed unreproducible.
#
# So the rule needs a reader, and the reader must not be a text scan. What went
# wrong was not a spelling; it was which `if()` a line sat inside. This check asks
# the file itself.
#
# ## How it asks
#
# It includes `PedanticCompiler.cmake` twice per compiler persona -- once with
# `PEDANTIC_COMPILER_WERROR` off, once on -- with `add_compile_options` replaced by
# a recorder and `check_cxx_compiler_flag` replaced by a stub that answers yes (see
# `scripts/pedantic-flag-probe/CheckCXXCompilerFlag.cmake`). The difference between
# the two recordings is, by construction, exactly the set of flags `WERROR` gates.
#
# That set may contain only flags that change whether a diagnostic is FATAL. A flag
# that changes WHICH diagnostics are produced is a violation whichever way it points
# -- appearing only when `WERROR` is on is #611; disappearing only when it is on
# would be the same defect wearing the other sign.
#
# Driving the file beats parsing it for a reason worth stating: a text scan would
# have to model `if`/`elseif`/`else`/`endif` nesting to answer "which condition is
# this line under", which is the one question that matters here, and a model of
# CMake that is subtly wrong fails in the confident direction. Including the file
# uses CMake's own answer.
#
# It is also already this project's idiom for asking a `cmake/portable/` module
# what it computes: `check-debug-prefix-map.cmake` and
# `check-pace-addr-opt-out.cmake` both `include()` `CompileCache.cmake` and
# drive it. The only thing new here is the stub, which those two do not need
# because the functions they call spawn nothing.

# Asking only as `Clang` would leave that whole branch unread.
#
# The fourth column is what the persona covers, because a row nobody can attribute

#
# The fifth is the flag that persona MUST add when `WERROR` is off -- its anchor.
# Without one this check cannot tell "the subject adds nothing for this persona"
# from "the subject is fine": `-fdiagnostics-color=always` is added at the top of
# the module, OUTSIDE `if(${PEDANTIC_COMPILER})`, so every persona records at least
# one flag no matter what the pedantic arms do. Measured: with all four
# `try_add_compile_options` calls deleted from the MSVC arm, the earlier
# "adds no flag at either setting" guard still reported success. The GNU personas
# were covered by a hardcoded `-pedantic` test and the MSVC ones by nothing, and
# the selftest's empty-subject case passed only because a synthetic subject omits
# that unconditional line -- the guard bit on the fixture and not on the subject,
# which is this project's own "the mode under test was not the mode in use".
#
# A column rather than a branch, so a fifth compiler brings its own anchor instead

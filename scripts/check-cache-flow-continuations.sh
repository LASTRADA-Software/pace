# Every cache-flow fall-back names which continuation it takes, and why.
#
# `RunCached` ends through one of two spellings and the choice is a JUDGEMENT the
# call site makes (#910):
#
#   Warn(reason)            -> std::nullopt -> RunPassthrough -> NO STORE
#   WarnAndCarryOn(reason)  -> the MISS path -> the STORE REPAIRS the entry
#
# The question both answer is "does the cache now hold a value that must be
# REPLACED?". Getting it backwards once cost a permanently dead cache: a
# `CompileValueVersion` bump does not move the key, so a foreign-generation value
# stays under the key the new build computes -- fetched, refused, and under `Warn`
# never overwritten. After a bump that is every key in the cache.
#
# Nothing else can catch it. Both spellings type-check, so the compiler cannot;
# `main.cpp` is in no test target (#909), so the suite cannot; and the symptom is
# a slow build rather than a failure.
#
# So the guard is CLASSIFICATION, and it is mandatory rather than opt-in: a call
# site not in the table below is a REFUSAL. An opt-in list is exact about the
# sites it knows and silent about the ones it does not, and silence reads
# identically to complete coverage (#492).
#
# And ONE door to the cache, for the same reason of a file no suite reaches. Every cache
# exchange in `main.cpp` goes through `CacheExchange`, whose verbose trace line is the
# launcher's own COUNT of its exchanges -- the count the dead-peer legs of both e2e fixtures
# judge, since time measured the host rather than the launcher (round 9). A
# `Cc::RunOneExchange` written anywhere else in the file is an exchange the trace never says,
# so it UNDERCOUNTS on the leg whose peer cannot count (refused): fails OPEN. So every call
# outside the door is refused, and a door with no call in it, or no door, is refused too. So
# is a route around it it has no row for (`DoorRoutes`); what it cannot see, and which way that
# fails, is stated at `run_door`.

# `Warn(record, Cc::CacheActionReason(Cc::FetchObservation::HitObjectUnwritable))` and the
# sentence an operator sees is a `constexpr` lookup away. A scan of `main.cpp`
# cannot see text that is not in `main.cpp`, so that row anchors on the OBSERVATION
# enumerator instead: stable, spelled at the site, and naming the exact state whose
# `why` the table carries. The preference is unchanged and the reason for it holds

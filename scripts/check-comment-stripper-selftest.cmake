# Drives `fastcached_strip_comment_line` in `scripts/lib/CheckCommon.cmake` over single lines.
#
# ## Why this file exists at all
#
# Eight checks read C++ through that one function -- `check-test-loops`, `check-cli-text-cell`,
# `check-enumerator-walks`, `check-istreambuf-iterator`, `check-markup-entities`,
# `check-ranges-seam`, `check-selftest-registered`, `check-target-pragmas` -- and a defect in it
# is a defect in all of them at once, silent in the direction that matters. It had one.
#
# A comment introducer inside a STRING LITERAL was read as a real introducer. On this tree
# `src/apps/pacectl/SocketExchange.cpp:410` carries `"...Accept: */*\r\n..."`, whose three
# characters `*` `/` `*` contain a `/*`; nothing closed it, and the remaining 51 lines of that
# file -- a `for (;;)` among them -- were blanked while the caller printed a clean count over
# lines it had never read. The sibling shape, a `//` inside a literal, truncated 21 lines across
# 16 files, losing text like `//") == 0)`: the rest of a `REQUIRE`.
#
# The function's own header had NAMED the blind spot for as long as it existed. It named it in
# the wrong direction -- "blind to either introducer inside a STRING LITERAL, as every
# regex-shaped reader here is" reads as a false-POSITIVE risk, and being blind to a MENTION
# costs nothing. Being blind to a USE is the whole job. That is why this file asserts what
# SURVIVES stripping and not only what is removed: a self-test written for the removal half
# passes under the entire defect.
#
# ## One case table, run against the shipped library and against six neuters
#
# A pure function over a line has no environment to stage, so the cases run in process. What
# they cannot do by themselves is fail: every one of them passes over a function that returns
# its input unchanged for the SURVIVES half, and over one that returns the empty string for the
# GONE half. So the table is ALSO run against six copies of the library with one decision
# removed from each, and a neuter that provokes NOTHING is reported as this file's own failure
# rather than as a pass -- three times in #1456 the fixture was the hole rather than the code.
#
# The neuter runs are subprocesses, because a neutered copy cannot be included beside the real
# one in a single CMake scope, and their verdict is read from their OUTPUT: a child that could
# not START would otherwise be indistinguishable from one that found nothing. Each child prints
# `CASES-RAN:` before any verdict is believed.
#
# ## What is deliberately NOT asserted as exact text
#
# Most cases name a substring that must survive and one that must be gone, rather than the whole
# stripped line. Whitespace here is a consequence of where a comment sat, and pinning it would
# make every case fail on a change that alters no verdict -- a self-test people then edit rather
# than read. Where the exact text IS the subject, `CaseExact` says so, and the neuters are what
# prove a substring case can fail at all.

# A git query that does not answer is never read as its negative (cmake/Version.cmake).
#
# The version comes from three git queries -- the nearest tag (the triple), the distance
# from it (the string) and the dirty check (the string's suffix). A dirty check that timed
# out once read as "clean" and a distance that timed out as "on the tag", each reported under
# the Exact severity, so `PACE_REQUIRE_EXACT_VERSION` could not catch either. Now the
# row a missing answer belongs to fails or says `-dirty-unknown`, every unanswered query
# makes the result Provisional, and each warning names what ITS query lost.
#
# This drives the real `GetVersionInformation` against a STUB git: a CMake script behind a
# `.cmd` on Windows and a shell script elsewhere, answering the five queries Version.cmake
# asks with canned output and HOLDING one chosen query past an injected timeout of a few
# seconds. An unknown query is logged and refused, so a query Version.cmake starts asking is
# noticed here rather than answered by accident. Each case asserts the resolved triple, the
# string, the severity of the final report and the phrase of the warning; the all-answer
# cases are the positive control that the stub RAN, since only it can produce their string.
#
# Those cases see only the words the RUNNING CMake prints, so the `classifications` table at
# the end is the cross-version guard: it hands every measured spelling, 3.28.3's capitalised
# ones included, straight to Version.cmake's classifier, so each is judged on every CMake.
#
# Usage: cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<repo> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> -P <this>
#   (internally re-entered as the driver with -DPACE_ROLE=driver, and as the stub with
#   -DPACE_ROLE=stub)

# A binary's shipped reference configuration must name every setting a
# configuration file can carry, and no setting it cannot.
#
# The option table is the single source of truth for what a file accepts -- the
# `yamlKey` column drives the parse -- and the shipped YAML is what an operator
# actually reads. Nothing links the two. A flag added with a key and no line in the
# reference is a setting that works and that nobody can find; a line in the
# reference for a key the table dropped is worse, because an operator writes it,
# restarts, and the binary refuses to start naming a key it has never heard of.
#
# Neither direction shows up in any build or test: the flag parses, the file
# parses, and the two simply describe different products.
#
# ## Why this takes its files as PARAMETERS
#
# `check-node-config-reference.cmake` asks exactly this question about
# `pace-node`, and its own header says why it must be asked -- every
# word of which is true of the daemon, which had no such check and is the binary
# most operators actually run
# ([#759](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/759)). Two checks
# differing only in two paths is the copy-paste this project treats as a defect, so
# this one is parameterised from the start.
#
# It does NOT repoint the node's registration at this script, and that restraint is
# deliberate rather than laziness: consolidating them is a change to a guard another
# lane's work depends on, and `check-glob-traversals.cmake` records the precedent --
# absorbing a consolidation into the ticket in front of you closes one ticket by
# swallowing another. The follow-up is small BECAUSE this is parameterised: point
# `node-config-reference` here and delete the older script. Nothing else.
#
# ## What this check does NOT see: the VALUE a key ships with
#
# It compares key NAMES. A line's value shape is invisible to it, and for one kind
# of setting that is a real gap rather than a boundary: a BOOLEAN shipped as a bare
# `#key:` is a trap, because "uncomment to enable" is the natural reading and
# uncommenting alone yields a type error and a binary that refuses to start.
# Booleans therefore ship as `#key: false`. The same bare shape is CORRECT for a
# value-taking setting (`#log_level:`): uncommenting alone fails loudly and
# self-explanatorily. So this is not a rule that could simply be extended to every
# key, which is why it is recorded here for the next person adding a setting rather
# than encoded.
#
# ## The two patterns, stated beside the two figures
#
# A census states its PATTERN, not only its number -- two audits of one file set
# differing by one, neither having miscounted, is what that rule is made of. So,
# exactly:
#
#   table keys      `\.yamlKey = "[a-z_]+"` over the table source, deduplicated.
#   reference keys  `^#([a-z_]+):` over the reference, one line each, NOT
#                   deduplicated (duplicates are their own refusal below).
#
# The reference pattern deliberately does not match a key mentioned in prose, and
# deliberately DOES match a commented key carrying an example value (`#log_source:
# false`) -- that line IS the commented setting, not a second mention of one. A
# looser `^#[a-z_]+:` counted without `sort -u` inflates the figure by re-counting
# nothing; that near-miss is why the pattern is written down here.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir>
#         -DPACE_TABLE=<path relative to source dir>
#         -DPACE_REFERENCE=<path relative to source dir>
#         -DPACE_LABEL=<name used in messages>
#         -P scripts/check-config-reference.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = the two agree. 1 = at least one key is in one and not the other,
# or a scan matched nothing, or the reference documents a key twice.

# A `cmake -P` script has no project, so every policy starts unset and CMP0057
# (`if(... IN_LIST ...)`) is one of them -- unset, the operator is an unknown
# argument and the script errors out rather than answering.

# `check-unique-temp-paths.cmake` is driven against staged trees, in BOTH directions.
#
# A guard nobody has watched refuse is not a guard, and one nobody has watched ACCEPT is not
# known to work either -- the accepting half is what catches a pattern that has quietly started
# matching everything, which for this check is the likely failure: the four files its rule was
# written for now DISCUSS `std::random_device` in prose, so a reader that counted comments would
# refuse the very tree it had just fixed.
#
# ## What each case stages
#
#   <case>/src/Pace/Core/IRandomSource.hpp   the seam, reading the device -- or not
#   <case>/src/apps/node/Subject.cpp              the text under test
#
# ## Read from the OUTPUT, never from the exit code
#
# `message(WARNING)` exits 0 on every CMake while printing `CMake Warning`, so an exit status
# cannot tell a refusal from a remark. Each case matches the check's own terminal text, FLATTENED
# first: CMake wraps its diagnostics at a column that depends on the scratch path's length, so a
# phrase can exist in the output and in no single line of it.
#
# ## The exemption arms stage a COPY of the check
#
# The exemption table is a `set()` inside the check and stays there rather than becoming an
# overridable path -- an override would be a way to silence the check from a command line. So
# those cases copy the check and rewrite the table in the copy, and each asserts it was judged by
# the STAGED one: a case that silently read the shipped empty table would go green while testing
# nothing.
#
# ## One arm is deliberately not covered
#
# The "enumerated no source file" refusal cannot be reached from a staged tree here, because the
# seam itself is a `.hpp` under `src/` and the positive anchor requires it to exist -- so the
# enumeration always finds at least one file. The arm stays, because the condition it guards is a
# broken enumeration rather than a staged tree, and a check that reports clean over nothing is
# the failure it exists for.

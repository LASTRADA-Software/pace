# Drive every verdict of `check-fatal-error-exit.cmake` against a staged record,
# in both directions.
#
# The check's acquisition half needs a real CMake to spawn and its answer depends
# on the machine, so the DECISION is split out behind
# `PACE_FATAL_EXIT_READINGS` and only the decision is driven here -- the
# rule `.agent/rules/testing.md` states about a stand-in whose measurement is
# comparable to the instrument's own overhead. Acquisition is left alone; it is
# exercised by the check itself on every platform CI builds.
#
# Both directions, because a check that has only ever been seen to pass has told
# you nothing and one that fails on a correct tree is worse than absent. The
# want-pass case is the reading every machine looked at so far actually produces,
# so a change that made the check refuse everything would fail here rather than
# turning every platform red at once.
#
# The child's output is CAPTURED, never inherited: the refusing cases print
# `CMake Error` on purpose, and inheriting that would trip this script's own
# FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION and report a self-test failure for a case that worked.
# It is printed only when a case comes out the wrong way, where tripping the
# pattern is exactly right.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-fatal-error-exit-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: whatever CMake gives it; the verdict is read from the output.

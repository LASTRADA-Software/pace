# Nothing under `src/apps/fastcache-cli/` asks the environment or the terminal a
# question directly (#134 §9.11).
#
# `live-stats` draws from a model and a rung, both handed to it: what the terminal can
# draw is `TerminalCapabilities`, decided once before the loop, and the environment
# reaches the binary through `Platform/Environment` from `main`. A `getenv`, `isatty`,
# `ioctl` or `GetConsoleMode` in a panel, the loop or a verb is the ambient read that
# design exists to exclude.
#
# ## Why a scan
#
# Because no behavioural test can see this. A panel that called `isatty` to decide its
# glyphs draws the right frame on the machine it was tested on, and the determinism
# property -- one event list renders byte-identical frames -- still holds wherever the
# answer happens to be stable. The loop's own tests are the behavioural half of this
# clause; this is the half that reads the source.
#
# ## What counts
#
# A token is matched as a SUBSTRING of the code, case-sensitively, after comments are
# stripped: `std::getenv`, `_isatty`, `secure_getenv`, `_wgetenv` and `ioctlsocket` are
# the same question asked through a different door, and a word-boundary match would let
# every one of them through. The prose documenting the rule -- `DashboardLoop.hpp` names
# all four tokens to explain this very check -- is a comment and is not a read.
#
# Blind spots, stated rather than papered over:
#
#   * a token inside a STRING LITERAL reads as code, as it does in every regex-shaped
#     reader here; a help text naming `isatty` would need an exemption row.
#   * a read reached through a first-party seam -- `Platform/Terminal`,
#     `Platform/Environment` -- is not a token here, deliberately: those seams are where
#     the question belongs, and the rule is that the CLI is HANDED their answers.
#
# ## Exemptions are rows with reasons, and a stale row is refused
#
# `scripts/cli-ambient-read-exemptions.txt` holds one `<path>|<token>|<reason>` row per
# permitted read. A missing file is a refusal, not an empty table -- two empty answers
# agree perfectly. A row with no reason, an unknown token, or a path this scan does not
# cover is refused; so is a row whose file no longer names its token, because a
# permission that has stopped describing the tree is what lets the next read through.
#
# ## Fails closed
#
# The same stripping and matching run over `src/Pace/Platform/`, where these calls
# LIVE, and must recognise at least one there. A scanner that recognises none of the
# tokens where they are known to be would report every CLI file clean, and that clean
# report would look exactly like this one. The control is found by scanning, not by a
# listed path, so moving a seam's file does not leave the check excusing a path that no
# longer exists.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check
# reports failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> [-DGIT_EXECUTABLE=<git>] \
#         -P scripts/check-cli-ambient-reads.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

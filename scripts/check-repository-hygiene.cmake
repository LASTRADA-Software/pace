# Repository hygiene: fail if a path that must never be committed is tracked by
# git.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`, and deliberately not as the .sh + .ps1 pair the other test
# drivers in this directory use. Those pairs exist because they drive processes
# and sockets in ways that genuinely differ per platform (SslStream versus
# `openssl s_client`, Start-Process versus `&`). This check runs git, compares
# strings and reports — nothing platform-specific — so a second copy in a second
# language would be two implementations of one rule differing only in syntax,
# each free to rot without the other noticing. It also has strictly fewer
# prerequisites than either: cmake is the build tool and is therefore always
# present, whereas pwsh is a separate install on Windows (the shipped shell is
# powershell.exe 5.1) and bash is not on a Windows box at all. There is in-repo
# precedent: cmake/MacOSNotarizePkg.cmake and cmake/MacOSSignBinaries.cmake are
# already `cmake -P` scripts.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> [-DGIT_EXECUTABLE=<git>] \
#         -P scripts/check-repository-hygiene.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = clean, or skipped. 1 = at least one forbidden path is tracked.
# A skip prints a line beginning with `SKIP: ` and exits 0, and the CTest
# registration in src/tests/CMakeLists.txt turns that into a Skipped result via
# SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION. The other drivers here use exit 77 with
# SKIP_RETURN_CODE, which is the nicer convention, but a `cmake -P` script cannot
# choose its own exit code before CMake 3.29 (cmake_language(EXIT)) and this
# project supports 3.28 — a SKIP_RETURN_CODE it could never return would be dead
# configuration. Swap both halves the day that floor moves.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# One row per path that must never be tracked:
#
#   <path relative to the source root>|<why it must not be committed>
#
# The reason is printed on failure, so whoever trips this meets an explanation
# rather than a rule. A second forbidden path is a second row and nothing below
# changes.
#
# No row may contain a ';' — these are CMake lists, and a semicolon inside a row
# would split it into two.

# Kill THIS lane's `local-gate.sh` and nobody else's.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why a script and not a note
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `pkill -f "local-gate.sh"` matches every lane's gate on the machine. Each
# worktree runs the same three script names, so a name match is guaranteed to hit
# somebody else's process, and it did twice in one night (#591) -- about ten
# minutes of gate time each time.
#
# The failure is quiet in a specific way: a gate killed mid-run prints NEITHER
# `GATE FAILED` nor `LOCAL GATE PASSED`, so the victim is holding output that
# describes nothing and reads like a crash in their own tree. They re-run, and lose
# the time twice.
#
# The rulebook already says a claim about a tool is checked against the tool. The
# defect was not ignorance of `pkill`; it was reasoning about the command's INTENT
# and never about its MATCH SET. A note asking people to be careful does not
# survive that, because the mistake feels correct while it is being made. So this
# is a helper that cannot express the wrong thing.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What identifies a process, and what does not
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# **A COMMAND LINE NARROWS; IT NEVER ATTRIBUTES.** Three measured traps, none of
# which a more careful `pkill` avoids:
#
#   * `pgrep -f "scripts/local.gate"` is a REGEX and the `.` matches the `-`. A
#     pattern is broader than its author reads it as.
#   * `pgrep -f` matches ITS OWN command line, and the bracket trick does NOT save
#     it -- see below, because the two spellings are one character apart and only
#     one is safe.
#   * two worktrees here are named `SAN-408` and `SAN-REQ-408`, one token apart, so
#     even an exact-looking path fragment matches a neighbour.
#
# **THE BRACKET TRICK WORKS IN ONE SPELLING AND NOT THE OTHER, FOR REASONS THAT ARE
# NOT THE ONE IT IS USUALLY CREDITED WITH.** Both measured on this machine:
#
#   * `pgrep -f '[l]ocal-gate.sh'` **self-matches.** pgrep tests the pattern against
#     every argv INCLUDING ITS OWN, where the bracket is still literally present, so
#     `[l]ocal-gate.sh` matches the text `[l]ocal-gate.sh`.
#   * `ps -eo cmd | grep -c '[l]ocal-gate.sh'` **does not.** grep searches the text
#     `ps` produced; its own argv holds `[l]ocal-gate.sh`, which does not contain
#     the literal `local-gate.sh` the regex matches.
#
# Stated in both directions on purpose: the next reader who finds only the safe
# spelling will otherwise copy it for the wrong reason and then simplify it back.
#
# The observed cost of the unsafe one is precise. A `pgrep -f` listing taken from a
# lane's own worktree came back with a fourth row -- its own `bash -lc`, `etime=00:00`,
# `cwd=/mnt/d/fastcached-worktrees/wire` -- which **attributed by cwd is
# indistinguishable from that lane's gate having just started.** A killer built on
# that targets its own shell.
#
# So the candidate set is built by reading each process's argv for a LITERAL, with
# no regex engine involved at all -- and then every candidate is ATTRIBUTED by
# something the command line cannot fake.
#
# **THE ASKING PROCESS IS IN THE CANDIDATE SET, and that is the root of both
# hazards above rather than two separate ones.** The self-match and the cwd
# coincidence are the same fact: a probe necessarily runs from the worktree of the
# lane asking the question, so it looks exactly like that lane's gate. Cwd
# attribution is therefore NECESSARY AND NOT SUFFICIENT. `gate_protected_pids`
# walks `$$` and its ancestors and removes them before any cwd is consulted, and
# `spare-self` is decided FIRST in `reap_verdict` for the same reason.
#
# **THE ROOT IS ATTRIBUTED BY ITS WORKING DIRECTORY; EVERYTHING ELSE BY ANCESTRY.**
# That reconciles two rules that read as contradictory. `team-run.md` says to reap
# by `/proc/<pid>/cwd` rather than `pkill -f`; the general rule says a process is
# attributed by its ancestor chain and never by a leaf `cwd`. Both are right about
# different halves:
#
#   * a gate's OWN cwd is its worktree, which is what tells two lanes apart, and no
#     other signal does;
#   * a gate's CHILDREN -- cmake, ninja, ctest and every test process -- have cwds
#     of their own, in build directories and scratch trees, so a cwd match would
#     miss them. Killing the parent alone orphans them, and an orphaned `ctest`
#     races the replacement run in the same build directory.
#
# Root by cwd, descendants by PPID. Neither alone is the rule.
#
# **READ THE LINK RAW.** `readlink -f` resolves the path and FAILS on a deleted
# directory, which is exactly the state a stranded gate reaches once its build tree
# is removed -- measured here: a sweep built on `readlink -f` reported 0 left while
# three were still holding ports. The raw link keeps the ` (deleted)` suffix and
# finds them.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Failing closed
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# **"Cannot determine the cwd" REFUSES TO KILL, and never falls back to a name
# match.** A fallback would restore the exact behaviour this exists to prevent, on
# the platforms where it is hardest to notice. That makes refuse-to-kill the
# DEFAULT answer, with Linux currently the one platform able to say otherwise.
#
# It also never signals itself or any of its own ancestors. Its own cwd is the
# worktree it was asked about, so without that it would be its own first victim --
# and would take the shell that invoked it with it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why this does not read the gate lock
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The gate takes `$HOME/.pace-local-gate.lock` ITSELF now (#1379). This section
# used to name `~/gate-logs/.gate.lock` and to say a gate run by hand takes no lock --
# both were one lane's wrapper convention, which is exactly what that ticket retired.
# Reading the lock to find the victim is still declined, for three reasons rather than
# from not knowing about it:
#
#   * **A `flock` lock names no process a script can read.** Its holder is the gate's
#     own `flock` process, whose CHILD is the run, so finding anything worth signalling
#     needs the same ancestry walk this already does.
#   * **The descendants hold nothing.** The gate re-execs under `flock -o`, so cmake,
#     ninja and ctest -- what orphaning actually costs -- carry no lock and none names
#     them.
#   * **Killing the holder ALONE is the one wrong kill.** It frees the lock while the
#     run it serialised carries on, and a second gate starts beside it. This helper
#     takes every gate process rooted at the worktree, that `flock` included -- its
#     command line names this script and it runs from the tree the gate `cd`s into --
#     which is the right shape.
#
# Said here so the next reader knows it was weighed rather than missed.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/reap-my-gate.sh [<worktree>]   kill the gate rooted at <worktree>
#                                          (default: this script's own repository)
#   scripts/reap-my-gate.sh --dry-run [<worktree>]
#   scripts/reap-my-gate.sh --self-test
#
# Exit: 0 whatever it found. Killing nothing is an ordinary outcome -- no gate was
# running -- and a status that distinguished it would be read as an error.

    # `spare-self` gets a LIVE case of its own below, and it is the one two lanes
    # independently pointed at: **the process doing the asking is in the candidate
    # set.** An earlier draft of this file called that arrangement recursive and
    # left it staged. It is not -- the wrapper calls the REAPER, not this
    # self-test -- and it is the case that matters most, because the failure is a
    # helper that kills the shell that invoked it.
    # Can this platform attribute ANOTHER process's working directory? Asked by
    # DOING it against a process staged in a known directory -- never by testing for
    # `/proc` or for an `lsof` binary.
    #
    # That distinction is the whole of #1224's macOS red. macOS has no `/proc` and
    # DOES ship `lsof`, so the old capability test answered yes while `gate_cwd_of`
    # answered nothing. Measured on `macOS-clang-release`: the two "must die" cases
    # failed and every "must be spared" case passed, because a reaper that attributes
    # nothing spares everything. **The break is in the direction that looks like
    # caution** -- the cases a reader takes as proof of care are exactly the ones that
    # pass when the attribution is dead -- so only a control can see it, and a
    # tool-presence test never could.
    #
    # It reports WHAT IT SAW rather than a bare no: "this platform cannot" and "the
    # probe never came up" are different states, and a skip reason that cannot tell
    # them apart sends the next reader to the wrong question. The comparison is on the
    # exact string because that is what `reap_verdict`'s prefix test needs -- a
    # platform that answers a different spelling of the same directory (a resolved

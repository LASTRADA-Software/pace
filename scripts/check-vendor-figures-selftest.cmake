# accepting cases matter as much as the refusing ones: a check that refused every tree would pass
# every refusal below.

#   rowReworded        the row no longer in the table's shape                refuses: nothing compared
#   emptyRoot          a root that holds no files                            refuses
#   secondRootCounted  a second root, with a true row in The copies          accepts, counting both
#   secondRootMissing  a second root with no row                            refuses: nothing compared
#   secondRootStale    a second root whose row states the wrong lines       refuses, naming the lines
#   rowNamesNoRoot     a row for a directory the roots file does not name    refuses
#
# Each of the last four was run against a mutant of the check when the table arrived (#178): walking
# the first root only fails secondRootCounted, secondRootMissing and secondRootStale, and dropping the
# refusal of a row naming no root fails rowNamesNoRoot. The cases that read `vendor/endo`'s own
# structural figures went with that copy (#1596).

# The verdict is `CMake Error` in the output, never the exit code.

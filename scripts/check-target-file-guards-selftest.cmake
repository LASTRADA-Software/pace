# `target-file-guards` must be SEEN to refuse, on each thing it claims and on nothing
# else.
#
# This check had never been watched refuse anything. #510 exists because a DELIBERATE
# canary -- a stray `]` somebody left in a comment -- caught it going blind, not
# because the check reported a problem. By this tree's own standard a guard nobody has
# watched refuse is not a guard, and this one had been carrying a silent defect for
# long enough to be fixed twice: #509 repaired one of its two readers, and #510 the
# other.
#
# The case that matters most here is `bracket`. Before #510, appending one `]` to an
# app table row took this check from
#
#     25 reference(s) to 5 optional target(s), all guarded
#
# to
#
#     10 reference(s) to 1 optional target(s), all guarded    -- and it PASSED
#
# Four targets and fifteen references silently unchecked. The old vacuity refusal could
# not catch it because it is a FLOOR OF ZERO and 1 is not 0, which is why `incomplete`
# is here too: it drives the completeness assertion that replaced the floor.
#
# #1369 gave the check a SECOND source of optional targets -- the directories the root added
# under a `PACE_BUILD_*` option outside `src/`, which was `vendor/` -- and fifteen cases
# that drove it. #1596 removed that directory, and the reader and its cases went with it; the
# two cases that pinned the frame walker the reader shared with the reference scan stay, since
# the scan still walks frames that way. Every synthetic tree still carries a root
# `CMakeLists.txt`, which the scan reads.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check
# reports failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-target-file-guards-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

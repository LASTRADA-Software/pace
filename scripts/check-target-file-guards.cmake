# Target-file guard hygiene: fail when a test registration names an OPTIONAL
# executable through `$<TARGET_FILE:>` without first asking whether that target
# exists -- and, since #423, when it asks a question that can only ever be
# answered no.
#
# `$<TARGET_FILE:x>` naming a target that was not built is not a test that gets
# skipped. It is a hard error at GENERATE time, so the whole configuration
# fails:
#
#   CMake Error at src/tests/CMakeLists.txt:943 (add_test):
#     Error evaluating generator expression: $<TARGET_FILE:pace-kv>
#     No target "pace-kv"
#
# That is #390. Two blocks were guarded on their own feature -- `tls-smoke` on
# `PACE_ENABLE_TLS`, the sccache smokes on `SCCACHE` -- and on nothing
# else, so `-DPACE_BUILD_DAEMON=OFF` refused to generate. The two
# conditions are independent: a feature can be enabled while the binary it needs
# is not built.
#
# It hid because it is conditional on the DEVELOPER's machine rather than on the
# tree. The sccache rows are themselves gated on finding sccache, so a checkout
# without sccache installed never reaches the broken reference and the flag
# appears to work. The error then names CMake rather than the option, on some
# machines and not others.
#
# The second rule exists because the first one can be satisfied by a guard that
# is not a condition at all. `src/apps` adds its table IN ORDER, so inside
# `src/apps/pace-cc/` the target `compile-cache-testclient` -- two rows
# further down -- does not exist yet, and `if(TARGET compile-cache-testclient)`
# is the constant FALSE. A fixture written that way reports its case SKIPPED on
# every machine, in every job, forever, in a sentence indistinguishable from a
# legitimate skip; and the rule above passes it, because it asks whether the
# guard was WRITTEN. That is skipped-versus-absent again, arriving through the
# checker rather than around it. `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` is where such a test
# belongs, and it is added after `src/apps` so every guard there is real.
#
# Which targets are optional is READ from `src/apps/CMakeLists.txt`, never
# restated here. That file's `PACE_APPS` table is the one place an app and
# the option gating it are written down, and a second copy is not a cross-check
# -- it is a second thing to be wrong. A new app therefore arrives under this
# guard by existing, without anyone remembering to add it.
#
# The app table was not always the only place a target became optional. From #1369
# until #1596 the ROOT `CMakeLists.txt` added `vendor/` only under
# `PACE_BUILD_TUI`, and a SECOND reader, with its own completeness argument, read
# the targets that directory declared. #1596 moved that code to core-cpp and the gated
# directory went with it, so the reader and its floor went too -- the floor said so
# itself. A directory gated that way again brings the reader back, from git history.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`, for the reason check-test-names.cmake gives: this reads
# files, compares strings and reports, so a .sh + .ps1 pair would be two
# implementations of one rule differing only in syntax.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-target-file-guards.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every optional target is asked about before it is named.
# 1 = at least one is not.

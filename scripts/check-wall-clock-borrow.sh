# A retained wall clock is a `WallClockRef`, never a raw `IWallClock` pointer or
# reference member.
#
# `WallClockRef` (Core/Clock.hpp) refuses to be built from an rvalue, so a holder that
# takes one cannot be handed a temporary -- at the parameter, which is what makes the
# refusal survive a FORWARDING constructor. A deleted rvalue overload on the storing
# type does not: inside a forwarder the parameter is a named lvalue, so it binds to the
# ordinary overload. That is measured, on gcc and clang, and it is the exact shape of
# #1028, where the temporary went to `FleetSampler` -- which stores no clock at all.
#
# The TYPE is the guard. This scan covers the one thing a type cannot: a new class
# declaring a raw `IWallClock const* _wall` and never reaching for `WallClockRef` at
# all. An opt-in set of guarded constructors reads identically to complete coverage
# (#492), so the rule is deny-by-default with one stated exception.
#
# bash 3.2: no mapfile, no declare -A, no ${var^^} -- a hygiene script runs on macOS.
# Invoke as `bash scripts/check-wall-clock-borrow.sh`, never bare: 15 of the scripts
# here are mode 644 in git and a bare call exits 126, which inside a want-fail
# assertion is indistinguishable from the rule firing (#723).

# A COMMENT is not a declaration. Two checks in one branch matched their own headers
# for want of this, and the sentence explaining this rule contains the pattern it bans.
#
# BLOCK comments are why this is not a one-line `sed`. The match below is anchored at
# the start of a line, so a `//` comment could never have matched it and stripping one
# bought nothing -- but a declaration commented out inside a `/* ... */` sits at the
# start of its own line and matches perfectly. The first version of this script stripped
# only `//`, and its self-test case passed with the stripping REMOVED: a fixture that
# could not fail, found by neutering rather than by reading.
# ONE awk over the whole file set, rather than three processes per file.
#
# It used to spend an `awk` to strip comments and then two `grep`s over the stripped
# text, PER FILE -- THREE processes per source for a scan whose actual work is one pass
# over the tree. The file count and what it costs are recorded once, at this check's
# registration in `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt`, rather than restated here where a second
# copy would drift. That is what put a 120 s budget out of reach on a hosted Windows
# runner, where a fork costs tens of milliseconds rather than the tenths of a
# millisecond it costs on the Linux legs. The per-line work below is the same
# algorithm, character for character; what is gone is the process per file.
#
# `FILENAME` and `FNR` replace `grep -n` exactly: `strip_comments` printed one line per
# input line, so the number grep reported was always the source line number.
#
# **`FNR == 1` resets the block-comment state per file, and it is load-bearing.** The
# old shape got this for free by running a fresh `awk` per file. Without it a file
# ending inside an unterminated `/*` would blank the start of the next one, and the
# scan would go quiet exactly where it should refuse.
#
# **The program lives in a FUNCTION rather than inside a `$( ... )`, and that is not
# style.** bash 3.2's command-substitution scanner does not skip comments, so one
# apostrophe inside the program would swallow the closing paren and surface as a parse
# error somewhere else entirely -- see #1100, which cost a macOS-only red and a
# bisection to find. macOS ships bash 3.2.
#
# `[[:space:]]` inside an awk program is used by `check-e2e-helpers.sh`, which is in the
# default set and runs on the same macOS leg, so the spelling is established here rather
# than assumed portable.

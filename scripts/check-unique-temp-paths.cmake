# `std::random_device` is not a uniqueness source, and a temp path may not bet on it.
#
# ## Why a scan and not a type
#
# A unique scratch path comes from `Testing::UniqueScratchPath` (`src/tests/ScratchPath.hpp`):
# pid AND counter, no entropy source that can fail. Nothing in the type system makes a test
# reach for it, so forgetting to must not read the same as deciding not to -- which is this
# repository's standing split between an obligation to DO SOMETHING and one to SAY WHY.
#
# ## What went wrong, because the number is the argument
#
# `StorageTestUtils.hpp`'s `TempFile` named its file
# `std::mt19937_64 { std::random_device {}() }()`. On the WSL2/libstdc++ host
# [#1507](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1507) was reproduced on,
# `std::random_device` answers **zero for 57% of draws** -- 1652 of 2880, measured across 32
# concurrent processes -- and `mt19937_64 { 0 }()` is always `2947667278772165694`. So 31 of
# those 32 processes agreed on one filename, and whichever opened it second was refused
# `InUse` by a `flock` doing precisely its job.
#
# That is the shape this check exists for: the symptom named the STORAGE layer, a ticket was
# filed against `CowTreeStorage::Open`, and the defect was four lines in a test helper. The
# unique-path helper had been written five times before with a counter; this was the sixth and
# the first to use something that merely LOOKS stronger than a counter, so none of the
# reasoning recorded against the other five applied to it.
#
# ## The rule
#
# `std::random_device` may be USED in exactly one place -- the production randomness seam,
# `Core/IRandomSource.hpp`, whose own comment owns the 32-bit `result_type` question. Anywhere
# else under `src/` is refused, or carries an exemption row with its reason.
#
# Comments are stripped first (`pace_strip_comments`), because the four files this rule
# was written for now EXPLAIN it in prose and a reader that counted those would refuse the
# very tree it had just fixed. Its blind spot is the shared stripper's: an introducer inside a
# string literal. That direction is a false GREEN and is accepted here for a stated reason --
# `std::random_device` inside a string literal is not a call, and a scan broad enough to catch
# one would refuse this file's own documentation.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, stated rather than left to be discovered
#
#   * It says nothing about a path built from a counter alone, which is the way the first five
#     copies were wrong. That one IS visible to review against the rulebook, and a pattern
#     wide enough to catch every hand-rolled uniqueness scheme would refuse the seam itself.
#   * It reads only `src/`. A script or a fixture outside it that names a temp path is the
#     POSIX helpers' concern (`scripts/lib/e2e-common.sh`).
#   * A NEW legitimate consumer of the platform entropy source is an exemption row, not a
#     reason to widen the pattern: there is one seam that reads the device, and a second one is
#     a design decision somebody should have to write down. `Core/ISecureRandom.hpp` (#1527) is
#     such a decision and reads NO device: it asks the operating system's generator directly,
#     because an engine seeded from this device is exactly what repeated nonces across processes.

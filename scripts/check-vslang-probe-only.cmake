# `VSLANG` may be set on a PROBE spawn and on nothing else.
#
# `VSLANG` selects `cl`'s diagnostic language. The launcher sets it so that two
# things it PARSES come back in a language it can read: the `/showIncludes` notes
# ([#692](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/692)) and the
# version banner, which since #195 is the compiler's identity
# ([#200](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/200)).
#
# Both of those spawns are read by nobody but this process. The REAL compile is
# different in kind: its diagnostics are the developer's, and forcing English there
# would trade a silent performance loss for silently anglicizing every warning and
# error they see. That is not a subtle distinction, and it is exactly the one a
# later change would erase without noticing -- "the notes are still unreadable on
# this machine, put the variable on the compile too" is a plausible next step that
# repairs a parse by breaking a person's build output.
#
# ## Why this is a check and not a comment
#
# The rule is written down in `.agent/rules/compile-cache.md` under "A compiler's
# WORDS are localized too", and in the Doxygen on both entry points. **Nothing read
# it.** Every test that existed asserted the variable REACHES the probe -- which a
# change that also set it on the compile spawn passes unchanged. A rule whose only
# reader is prose is the shape [#683](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/683)
# was filed about: a plausible claim that nothing can make fail. This is its reader.
#
# ## What is counted, and why it is the assignment rather than the word
#
# The scan counts `EnvironmentAssignment` sites -- lines spelling `.name = "VSLANG"`
# -- and not mentions of `VSLANG`. The word appears in prose on both entry points
# and in the notes explaining the residue, and a scan that counted those would fail
# on an edit to a comment while passing a change that moved the assignment. Counting
# the thing that has an EFFECT is what makes the census mean something.
#
# It is a pinned census rather than a file allow-list, deliberately. `main.cpp`
# holds both the preprocess probe and the real compile, so "may this file mention
# VSLANG" cannot express the rule at all -- the answer is yes, once. A second
# assignment appearing in that same file is precisely the defect, and only a count
# catches it.
#
# Test sources are exempt: a test must be able to construct the assignment to
# exercise it, and one that could not would be asserting nothing.

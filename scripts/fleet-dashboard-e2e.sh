# End-to-end test of the fleet dashboard (POSIX). Starts a real
# pace-node with a scheduler surface and an admin surface, and asks
# the dashboard the questions no unit test can:
#
#   1. The routes are actually reachable  — a unit test drives `MakeFleetRoutes`
#                                           directly; only this proves the rows
#                                           reach the accept loop, over a real
#                                           socket, on a real bound port.
#   2. /metrics did not change            — the whole reason the dashboard shares
#                                           `--admin-listen` is that an operator's
#                                           existing scraper keeps working. If a
#                                           credential or a route ever leaks onto
#                                           that path, every deployment breaks at
#                                           once and this is what says so.
#   3. The credential is enforced         — and answers with a challenge a browser
#                                           can prompt for, in both the Basic and
#                                           Bearer spellings.
#   4. A worker appears in the fleet      — the node registers with its own
#                                           scheduler, so the page shows a machine
#                                           rather than an empty table. That is the
#                                           end-to-end path from REGISTER through
#                                           the registry to the rendered document.
#   5. The page is self-contained         — no script tag and nothing fetched, so
#                                           it renders on the air-gapped network a
#                                           build fleet usually lives on.
#
# Registered in `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` rather than beside the node, because a
# script-driven test naming an executable belongs where every target already
# exists -- `src/apps` walks its table in order, and a `$<TARGET_FILE:>` guard on a
# binary configured later silently skips the test forever.

# How long a bounded wait in this fixture may take.
#
# 240 seconds, and the number is what it is because of what happens BEFORE the
# admin surface binds: the node resolves each `--toolchain` first, which walks
# the compiler's include tree. That is thousands of cold stat and read calls,
# near-instant on a warm developer machine and minutes on a contended CI runner
# whose page cache holds none of it.
#
# The cost is paid ONCE per runner, and the three fixtures below measured it
# exactly. Run back to back against the same node and the same `/usr/bin/c++`:
#
#     fleet-dashboard-e2e              timed out at  60s
#     fleet-dashboard-tls-e2e          passed in    5.08s
#     fleet-dashboard-self-signed-e2e  passed in    1.27s
#
# Nothing differs between them but page-cache warmth, so whichever runs first
# pays for all three -- and 10s, then 60s, were each enough on a quiet runner
# and not on a busy one. `EpollSocket::WriteVectored` took 26s in that same run,
# which is what "busy" looked like.
#
# Generous rather than unbounded: a wait nothing can end is a suite timeout
# naming nothing, which this repository has already paid for once. This one
# named the port, the elapsed time and the node's own last log line, and that is
# what made two runner failures diagnosable from the output alone.

# Ready, not merely bound (#634). The next statement dials this very port and
# requires a 200 out of it, while `wait_for_port` returns as soon as the admin

#
# What that costs is a DELAY, not a refusal, and the distinction is worth keeping
# straight: a dial into a bound socket completes into the listen backlog and is
# served once the loop starts, so nothing here fails because a listener was not
# yet accepting. Measured on the daemon, whose equivalent gap is the same shape:
# a real transaction succeeded on every run issued the instant the port answered.
#
# So this buys a flake removed rather than a false pass, and it is a weaker claim
# than the n4 site in `cluster-e2e` -- which asserts on a REFUSAL and so cannot
# tell a node that does not lead from one that could not answer. Every assertion

# A connection the server has ACCEPTED and on which nothing has been said. That is
# what a browser's speculative preconnect is, and this surface used to answer it
# `400 Bad Request` -- so the fleet dashboard failed in Chrome, intermittently,
# and under no fixture in this tree, because every one of them sent immediately.
#
# ## Why the probe never writes, although the report does
#
# The reported shape is *connect, wait, then ask*, and it cannot be asserted on:
# an unfixed server answers and closes at its deadline, the client's late write
# then draws an RST, and the RST discards the receive buffer holding the very
# response the assertion is about. Measured against one unfixed binary here: a
# `python` client read the `400`, a bash client read nothing. A leg built on that
# passes on the bug about as often as it fails, which is worse than no leg -- it
# is a guard that reports.
#
# What a surface volunteers to a peer that has said nothing is not a race, and
# against the unfixed binary it is a `400` every time. That is the same defect
# seen from the side that can be observed, so it is the whole assertion.
#
# The control below is not decoration: "the surface answered nothing" and "the
# surface was never reachable" are one empty string, so a leg asserting emptiness
# needs a sibling that must be non-empty.
#
# ## What this does not assert
#
# That the idle connection is SERVED. With the head reader fixed, a preconnect
# used after the deadline gets no response at all, and whether the operator then
# sees the dashboard depends on the client retrying on a fresh connection --
# closing is retriable where a `400` is final, which is what makes it the better
# answer and not the whole one. Serving it needs the pre-first-byte wait to stop
# sharing one number with the mid-head read deadline; tracked on #828.
#
# `/healthz` and not `/fleet`, although `/fleet` is the path the report named: the
# outcome is decided by the shared request-head reader before any route is
# consulted, so the route is not the variable, and `/healthz` depends on neither a
# credential nor this node having won an election.
#
# Plaintext only. The probe has to be silent from the accept onwards, and over TLS
# the handshake IS the first bytes -- there is no way to connect, say nothing, and
# still be talking to the admin surface. Said out loud rather than skipped
# silently, so a green TLS run is never mistaken for this having been checked.

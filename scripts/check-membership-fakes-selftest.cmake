# `check-membership-fakes.cmake` is driven against staged trees, in BOTH directions.
#
# A guard nobody has watched refuse is not a guard, and a guard nobody has watched ACCEPT is
# not known to work either -- so half these cases expect a clean run. The refusing half is
# cheap to get right and the accepting half is what catches a pattern that has quietly started
# matching everything.
#
# ## What each case stages
#
# One miniature tree per case, because the check's subject is a whole-tree question (what does
# the enumeration reach, and does the shared header still define the fakes):
#
#   <case>/src/tests/MembershipFakes.hpp    two shared fakes, or none
#   <case>/src/apps/node/Subject_test.cpp   the text under test, or absent
#
# ## Read from the OUTPUT, never from the exit code
#
# `message(WARNING)` exits 0 on every CMake while printing `CMake Warning`, so an exit status
# cannot tell a refusal from a remark. Each case matches the check's own terminal text, and the
# output is FLATTENED first: CMake wraps its diagnostics at a column that depends on the scratch
# path's length, so a phrase can exist in the output and in no single line of it.
#
# ## The exemption arms stage a COPY of the check
#
# The exemption table is a `set()` inside the check, and it stays there rather than becoming an
# overridable path: an override would be a way to silence the check from a command line. So the
# two exemption cases copy the check (and the helper library it includes) into the scratch tree
# and rewrite the table in the copy. Each asserts it was judged by the STAGED check, because a
# case that silently read the shipped empty table would go green while testing nothing.

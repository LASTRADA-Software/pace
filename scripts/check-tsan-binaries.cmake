# Every Catch2 test BINARY this tree registers is a row of the ThreadSanitizer
# gate's `TARGETS` table, or carries an exemption here with a written reason.
#
# ## Why this is a check and not a review item (#1209)
#
# `pace-cc-tests` sat outside the sanitized scope for as long as it existed.
# No tag could have reached it: the launcher does not link the Pace library,
# so it is a separate binary, and the gate's other rows name binaries that cannot
# contain its cases. `scripts/check-tsan-scope.cmake` could not see it either --
# that check asks whether a scoped test CASE carries a tag the gate selects, which
# is a question about cases inside binaries the gate already runs.
#
# The ticket enumerated the test binaries by hand and its table listed four. This
# tree registers SIX with `catch_discover_tests`, five of them in a default
# configuration; `pacectl-tests` and `CowTreeTests` were in neither the
# table nor any row. Neither was threaded then, so the ticket's conclusion survived
# its census (`pacectl-tests` stopped being so with #134 and is a gate row
# now) -- but a hand list is exact about what it knows and silent about what it
# does not, and that silence reads identically to complete coverage (#492). The
# census was written by whoever understood the gap best, and it still missed two.
#
# ## What makes this derivable where the threaded census is not
#
# `scripts/tsan-gate.sh`'s header and the `clang-tsan` job both decline to claim
# the scope table names every threaded FILE, and they are right to: that census
# matches `std::thread` in a source, which is a PROXY -- a test reaching threads
# through a helper spawns none of its own, and one naming the type in a comment
# spawns none at all. A check built on it would refuse correct files and miss
# incorrect ones.
#
# The BINARY question has no such gap. A Catch2 test binary is one that
# `catch_discover_tests()` registers, and that registration is a fact about the
# build rather than an inference about a source. So the set is DERIVED here and
# the answer for each member is a decision somebody wrote down.
#
# ## The exemption is the mechanism, and an empty one is refused
#
# A binary nobody has decided about is exactly what this check exists to surface,
# so there is no way to be silent: a row with no reason is refused, a row naming a
# binary that no longer registers is refused as STALE, and a row that is ALSO a
# `TARGETS` row is refused as a contradiction. An exemption nobody must keep true
# would wave through the next one, which is the argument `test-name-hygiene`
# already makes for its own exemption rows.
#
# ## An exemption's claim is RE-MEASURED on every run
#
# Every exemption this table has carried rested on one claim: *no source under
# this directory names a thread primitive*. That claim was written down with a
# date and then never read again, and it went false -- `pacectl-tests`
# stayed exempt as "single-threaded" after #134 gave it a thread pool and two
# suites asserting on thread identities, and this check went on passing, because
# a reason was a string it only required to be non-empty.
#
# So a row names the DIRECTORY its claim is about, and the check scans it: a row
# whose directory names a primitive in `PaceTsanThreadPrimitives` outside a
# comment is refused, and so is a directory that is missing or holds no C++
# source, since a claim about nothing verifies nothing.
#
# This is the thread CENSUS the section above declines to trust, and it is used
# here in the one direction where its errors are cheap. Its false positive -- a
# primitive NAMED by something that spawns nothing, `std::thread::id` for one --
# refuses an exemption, and the remedy for that is to sanitize a binary that did
# not strictly need it: a slower CI job, never a hidden race. Its false negative
# -- a thread spawned through a helper defined outside the directory -- leaves
# the row exactly as unverified as it was before this scan existed.
#
# ## What this check does NOT claim
#
# That a clean scan proves an exempt binary single-threaded. It proves the
# written claim still holds, which is weaker: the helper case above passes it.
# What the check guarantees is that a NEW test binary cannot arrive with nobody
# having decided, and that a decision resting on a claim cannot outlive the claim
# where the claim is the kind a scan can re-take.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-tsan-binaries.cmake
#
# Exit: the verdict is the OUTPUT, not the status -- read through
# `FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`, because a `-P` script that merely WARNS exits 0.

# `check-control-bytes.cmake` is driven against staged trees, in BOTH directions.
#
# The accepting direction is the one that matters most here, and it is not decoration.
# This repository carries NO control byte today -- the check reports clean on the real
# tree -- so every case below that expects a refusal has to PLANT one, and a check that
# had silently stopped reading any file at all would pass the accepting case perfectly.
# The clean cases therefore assert the file COUNT as well as the verdict.
#
# ## Why a planted byte and not a fixture committed with one
#
# A file carrying a BEL cannot be committed to this repository -- the check under test
# refuses it, which is the point -- so the fixture has to write the byte at run time.
# `string(ASCII 7 ...)` is what produces it, the same call the check uses, and that is
# a shared premise rather than a coincidence: if `string(ASCII)` stopped producing the
# byte, the check would stop refusing and this self-test would stop planting, together
# and in silence -- every case would go green over nothing. So one case asserts that
# call produces exactly one byte.
#
# ## The fixtures are NOT written with `file(WRITE)`
#
# Measured: `file(WRITE)` writes `\n` as CRLF on this Windows host, so every staged file
# carried a CR -- which the check correctly refuses, so all four accepting cases failed
# on a correct check. The fixture was the violation.
#
# `execute_process(COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "${body}" OUTPUT_FILE ...)` writes
# the bytes: measured, an argument carrying embedded LF, BEL and TAB comes back out of
# the file unchanged, with one LF appended. That is the whole reason the write goes
# through a subprocess, and it is worth the awkwardness -- a fixture for a check about
# BYTES cannot be written through a path that rewrites them.
#
# ## Every tree carries one file the fixture did not ask for
#
# `scripts/lib/third-party-roots.txt` has to exist, because the helper refuses a tree
# without it -- and `.txt` is in the allow-list, so it is SCANNED. Every count below
# therefore includes it, and that is stated rather than silently absorbed: a baseline of
# one is the difference between "the filter works" and "the filter matched my file".
#
# ## Every case runs in BOTH file-set modes
#
# The check asks `pace_tracked_files` which files hold a forbidden byte, and the two modes
# answer it by different mechanisms: git mode with one `git grep -a -P`, the walk by reading
# every file as hex. A staged tree is not a git repository, so without a second pass every case
# here would exercise the walk while CI's checkout takes git -- the shape that has already
# shipped a guard that passed. So each case is staged twice, once as a plain directory and once
# as a repository with the tree added to its index, and the mode is asserted wherever the check
# prints it: in every accepting verdict and in the empty-scan refusal.
#
# ## Read from the OUTPUT, never from the exit code
#
# `message(WARNING)` exits 0 on every CMake while printing `CMake Warning`, so an exit
# status cannot tell a refusal from a remark. Matched FLATTENED, because CMake wraps its
# diagnostics at a column that depends on the scratch path's length.

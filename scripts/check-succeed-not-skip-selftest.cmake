# `succeed-not-skip` must be SEEN to fail, and on every direction it claims.
#
# The check exists because `SUCCEED` where a case could not RUN reports a green result
# for a property nothing established (#685). A guard for that is worth nothing until it
# has been watched refusing something, and worth less than nothing if it refuses
# everything -- so this drives the real check against synthetic trees and asserts each
# verdict SEPARATELY rather than inverting one run with `WILL_FAIL`.
#
# A mutation that reddens everything must not pass here. That is why seven cases assert
# the check stays SILENT and each refusing case asserts the phrase naming ITS OWN
# refusal: a check that objected for the wrong reason is a check that will object to the
# wrong code tomorrow.
#
# The trees are built here rather than committed, because a fixture holding a
# deliberately-wrong `SUCCEED` would be a violation of the rule under test, and
# excluding it from the scan would put a hole in the thing being proved.
#
# Thirteen cases:
#
#   clean          a `SUCCEED` that ends a case PASSES -- an always-failing check is as
#                  useless as an always-passing one
#   bare           `SUCCEED()` with no message PASSES. `Ranges_test.cpp` uses it after a
#                  block of static_asserts: a case that ran with nothing left to assert
#   commented      the idiom quoted in a `//` COMMENT PASSES. This rule is written out in
#                  `.agent/rules/testing.md` and cited in test comments, so a scan that
#                  could not tell prose from code would refuse its own documentation
#   block-comment  the same inside a `/* ... */` block written without leading stars,
#                  which is what a historic note quoting the idiom looks like
#   bail-out       `SUCCEED` followed by `return;` FAILS, and NAMES the file
#   one-line       `if (!ready) { SUCCEED("x"); return; }` FAILS -- the same defect in one
#                  line, which a scan starting at the FOLLOWING line walks past
#   vocabulary     a skip-vocabulary message with NO return FAILS. The two signals must
#                  each work alone, or the check is really one signal with a spare
#   unreadable     a `SUCCEED` this scan cannot read on one line FAILS as its own
#                  outcome -- "could not determine" is not "fine"
#   none           test sources with no `SUCCEED` at all FAIL as a broken scan
#   no-sources     a tree with no test source at all FAILS as a broken scan, and says so
#                  differently, because a moved source root and a renamed macro are two
#                  different repairs
#   excluded       a violation under a build tree is IGNORED -- Catch2's own self-tests
#                  are full of `SUCCEED` and nobody here can edit them
#   git            the mode CI actually takes, three ways: an untracked vendored violation
#                  is ignored, a TRACKED one is still caught, and an index entry whose
#                  file was deleted from the worktree does not turn an unreadable path
#                  into a finding this check's registration cannot tell from a real one
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports
# failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# A `directory walk` expectation below names the mode CLASS and not which of its two reasons
# ran. Since #1485 a walk says whether there was no index at all or whether the index named no
# matching file, and which one a staged tree gets depends on where the scratch directory sits --
# a tree with no `.git` of its own is still inside a work tree whenever `CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`
# is. The git-against-walk distinction these cases exist for is unaffected; the two reasons are
# pinned in `check-tracked-files-selftest.cmake`, which controls the git probe instead of

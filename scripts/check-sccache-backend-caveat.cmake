# Every page that recommends pointing sccache at fastcached must carry, right
# there, what that costs under MSVC and clang-cl.
#
# "Point sccache at fastcached" is by definition ONE cache shared by every
# checkout and every machine pointed at it, which is the maximal form of the
# hazard in .agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md. PR #171 put a `message(WARNING)`
# in cmake/portable/CompileCache.cmake, which reaches the audience that
# configures that module. Issue #170 is the other audience: they have their own
# build system, set the variable themselves, and never go near it -- and
# README.md additionally claimed the OPPOSITE of the hazard, which read as
# reassurance.
#
# Prose drifts the way an include graph drifts: nothing fails, nothing warns, and
# the next page pitching this is written by somebody who never saw the caveat on
# the others. So the rule is enforced rather than remembered -- the same shape as
# check-net-boundary.cmake, and for the same reason. The message this prints on
# failure is the full statement of the rule; it is deliberately not restated here.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`, for the reasons check-repository-hygiene.cmake states at
# length: this compares strings and reports, so a .sh + .ps1 pair would be two
# implementations of one rule differing only in syntax, and cmake is the one tool
# guaranteed present.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-sccache-backend-caveat.cmake
#
# Optionally, and all three only affect what this reports about ITSELF -- never
# the verdict, which is a property of the source tree alone:
#
#   -DFASTCACHED_SCAN_BUDGET_SECONDS=<n>    the wall-clock budget to report
#                                           headroom against. Omitted, the cost
#                                           is reported with no headroom line.
#   -DFASTCACHED_SCAN_NARRATE_AFTER=<n>     start narrating progress once the
#                                           scan has been running this long.
#   -DFASTCACHED_SCAN_PROGRESS_EVERY=<n>    how often, in files, to consider
#                                           narrating.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every recommendation carries its caveat. 1 = at least one does not.

# Script mode has no project, so every policy starts UNSET: a policy-gated
# construct then errors out or silently changes meaning, and which of the two
# depends on the CMake running it. See .agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md.
#
# This file is why that matters here. Under CMP0007 OLD, `list()` DISCARDS empty
# elements -- which is every blank line in every file scanned below, so a line
# number is off by however many blank lines precede it. It reproduced exactly
# that way: identical on CMake 4.3 (where the policy defaults NEW) and wrong from
# the first blank line on CMake 3.28, which is the version this project supports.
#
# It used to be a hand-set `if(POLICY CMP0007) cmake_policy(SET ... NEW)` block,
# under a comment opening `A cmake -P script has no cmake_minimum_required`. That
# sentence was true when it was written and this line makes it false, so both are
# gone: one declaration sets CMP0007 along with every other policy of that
# vintage, and a per-policy opt-in only covers the trap somebody already met.

# What this check COSTS, which is a quantity under conditions and not a number.
#
# The scan is 800-odd individual file reads and essentially no compute. Measured
# on WSL2 9p (`/mnt/d`) on 2026-09-03: 4.3 s wall against 0.14 s user and 0.26 s
# sys, so 91% of the run is spent waiting on the filesystem bridge and the rest
# is rounding. That is the entire cost model -- per FILE, and set by the
# filesystem rather than by anything this script decides.
#
# Three figures for this one check were live in the tree at once (#479): the
# registration comment in src/tests/CMakeLists.txt said 0.2-0.5 s and "still far
# inside the timeout", a quiet bridged checkout measures ~4.5 s, and two lanes
# measured 53-57 s against a 60 s ceiling while several gates ran at once. Two
# orders of magnitude, and none of the three carried its conditions -- so each
# read as a fact about this check when all three are facts about a filesystem.
#
# The fix is therefore NOT a fourth number. This check measures itself and says
# so on every run, green included, so the margin is an observation somebody can
# act on rather than a claim written once and never re-taken. AGENT.md, under
# "Caching an expensive repeated answer": record a table of conditions, not a
# number; a spread states its own uncertainty and forces a citer to pick a row.
#
#   <highest ms/file this band covers, or `unbounded`>|<name>|<the conditions, and whether the per-file figure was measured or derived>
#
# Ceilings ascend and the last row is the catch-all. These are bands, not
# thresholds: nothing fails for landing in one. They exist so a reader of a slow
# run is told which of three known situations they are in instead of being left
# to re-time the check by hand, which is what #479 cost two lanes in one day.
#
# Each row says whether its per-file cost was MEASURED or DERIVED, because a
# handoff is a citation and only the sending end can make that distinction --
# AGENT.md again. Two of these three rows are wall times somebody else recorded,
# divided by a corpus count taken here; a reader who assumes all three were
# observed the same way will trust the widest one most, and it is the softest.

# What an interval MEANS, separated from taking one.
#
# A wall clock can step backwards, and the arithmetic does not care: the
# subtraction yields a negative and every consumer downstream then reads it as a
# number rather than as a failure to measure. THREE outcomes, not two -- and the
# third is the one that was missing (#1313).
#
# It is a function rather than two comparisons at each site because the two
# consumers get it wrong in OPPOSITE directions, so a single spelling is what
# keeps them from disagreeing: a negative interval reads to the narration
# threshold as `not slow yet` (silence, when the run may have been very slow) and
# to the cost bands as the FASTEST band (`-76 ms/file` is `LESS_EQUAL 2`, so a
# bridged run reports itself native). One is a missing line and the other is a
# confident wrong answer about the very thing this check exists to report.
#
# EVERY interval is recorded, not only the two the cost line happens to read.
# This script takes FOUR -- the whole run, the directory walk, one per root at
# the walk's narration point, and one per progress checkpoint -- and they can
# DISAGREE, which is the whole reason the third outcome exists. A step landing
# inside the read phase makes a checkpoint's interval negative while the
# whole-run and walk intervals stay positive, so a flag derived from those two
# alone discards a step this script has already SEEN and then reports a band
# across it. So the outcome is recorded HERE, where the subtraction happens,
# rather than at whichever sites the reporting arm remembers to consult: the
# label is what makes the record readable, and it is required for that reason.
#
# Labels are deduplicated, because the per-root and per-checkpoint sites run many
# times and a reader needs to know WHICH KIND of interval stepped, not how often
# one of them was looked at.
#
# There is deliberately no per-call outcome to inspect. The RECORD is the one
# representation, so no consumer can enumerate a subset of the sources and be
# silent about a source somebody adds later -- which is the defect this function
# exists to close, and it would be reintroduced by a caller that branched on its
# own interval instead of reading the record.
#
# @param label What this interval is, for the report: a noun phrase that reads
#        after "the wall clock went BACKWARDS during ...". Deduplicated, because

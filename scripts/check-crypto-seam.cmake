# No first-party file includes a Monocypher header except the Core units that ARE the seam:
# `src/Pace/Core/Ed25519.cpp` and `src/Pace/Core/X25519.cpp` (#178).
#
# ## Why a seam, and why a check rather than a build rule
#
# Monocypher is vendored (`vendor/monocypher`, vendor/VENDOR.md) to give every node an identity
# of its own: Ed25519 signatures and X25519 key agreement, over which the Raft handshake, the
# 0xFC node proof, the lease and the roster will all be rebuilt. Every one of those is a place a
# cryptographic primitive can be misused -- the default EdDSA over BLAKE2b called where RFC 8032
# Ed25519 was meant, a shared secret used raw instead of through HKDF, an all-zero X25519 result
# accepted, a seed passed to a function that wipes it. The Core units are where each of those is
# decided ONCE and checked against the RFC vectors. A second caller of Monocypher is a second
# place to get each of them wrong, and nothing about a green build says it was.
#
# The build cannot say it: the include directories are PUBLIC on `pace-monocypher`, as they
# must be for the two units to reach them, and Pace links the library PRIVATE -- which keeps
# the headers from Pace's CONSUMERS but not from any file inside Pace itself. So it is a
# scan, in the default ctest set, like `ranges-seam`.
#
# ## What is scanned, and what counts as an include
#
# First-party C++, DERIVED rather than listed: `pace_first_party_cxx`, which is every
# tracked C++ source (`git ls-files`, or a directory walk where there is no index) minus the
# third-party roots of `scripts/lib/third-party-roots.txt`. Monocypher's own sources include each
# other and are declined, and counted as declined.
#
# An include is a `#include` or `#import` directive, in code with comments stripped
# (`pace_scan_code_lines`), naming a file whose LAST path component is `monocypher.h`,
# `monocypher-ed25519.h`, or either `.c`: a relative path into `vendor/` is the same crossing as
# the angled spelling, and including a `.c` compiles the implementation into another unit. Matched
# case-INSENSITIVELY, because a filesystem that is (Windows, macOS by default) resolves
# `<Monocypher.h>` to the same file. `MonocypherBytes.hpp`, the seam's own pointer bridge, is not a
# Monocypher header and is not matched.
#
# ## The permitted rows are the positive control
#
# Each permitted file must EXIST, be ENUMERATED, and be SEEN including a Monocypher header. A row
# that has stopped doing any of the three is refused as stale: that is what a broken pattern, a
# moved seam or an enumeration that skipped `src/` all look like, and each of them would otherwise
# report a clean tree over files it never read.
#
# ## Blind spots, stated
#
# - A header reached through a macro (`#include MONOCYPHER_HEADER`) is not seen. None exists.
# - A file that is not C++ by extension is not scanned; this project compiles no C of its own.
# - This guards WHO may call Monocypher, not whether those two call it correctly. That is what
#   the RFC vectors and the negative cases beside them are for.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. The verdict is `CMake Error` in the output, never the exit code.

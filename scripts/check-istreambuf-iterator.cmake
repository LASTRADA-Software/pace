# No C++ source in this tree constructs from `std::istreambuf_iterator`.
#
# GCC 14 at `-O2` and above inlines that iterator's `sgetc` and then reports
# `-Werror=null-dereference` inside `<streambuf>` itself. It is a false positive, and
# one this project cannot silence: warnings are errors here and the rule is to fix
# them at the source rather than suppress them. The house spelling is a sized read --
# `Pace::Cc::ReadFileBytes` in `src/apps/pace-cc/FileBytes.hpp` for bytes,
# `out << in.rdbuf()` for text -- which is also one allocation and one read instead of
# a per-character loop with geometric regrowth and then a full-size copy. The
# workaround is the better implementation regardless of the warning.
#
# ## Why a check and not a comment
#
# Because the comments were already there.
#
# Before this check, `git grep -n "istreambuf_iterator" -- 'src/'` at `ed295468` found
# **8 occurrences in 8 files: one use and SEVEN comments warning against it**. The
# pattern travels with the number deliberately -- #1029 records two people producing
# wrong counts for this in one hour, in opposite directions, neither of whom had
# miscounted: one described a worktree as though it were master, the other filtered
# comments with a `grep -v` that removed 5 of 7 and left a survivor that was still a
# comment. A census states its pattern, not only its number.
#
# `FileBytes.hpp` exists specifically to be the one spelling and carries the whole
# argument in its doc comment. That is about as loudly as a convention can be written
# down, and it still spread -- to `compile-cache-testclient/main.cpp`, and then to two
# more sites on a feature branch, one of which took `Linux-gcc-release` red at edge 495
# of 691 ([#1029](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1029)).
#
# This is [#970](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/970)'s shape
# exactly. There, `producer | grep -q` under `pipefail` came back in eighteen sites
# across twelve scripts, five of which carried a comment explaining why they avoided
# the idiom, and the remedy was a scan rather than better prose. The tree's own
# sentence for it: *a rule stated in the files that obey it reaches no file that does
# not.*
#
# ## Why only a release build could see it
#
# `-Wnull-dereference` is in neither `-Wall` nor `-Wextra`, needs optimisation to
# fire, and `-fsyntax-only` cannot reach it. Both times, the author had run MSVC
# `cl-debug` and a clang-tidy sweep and both were green -- as was `clang-debug` with
# ASan and UBSan, and a cluster e2e running a binary built from that tree. A build
# also stops at the FIRST failure, so the second instance hid a byte-identical
# sibling behind it that was never reached; fixing only the named site would have
# relocated the failure one file along, where it presents as a regression introduced
# by the fix, with no failure history
# ([#172](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/172)).
#
# So this runs in the DEFAULT ctest set, where every developer meets it, rather than
# waiting for the one CI leg that compiles at `-O3`.
#
# ## A use, not a mention
#
# Seven of the eight original hits were prose. A scan that could not tell those apart
# would refuse the documentation of its own rule, with no escape hatch but rewording
# the comment -- which is a check people delete rather than obey. So comments are
# stripped before matching, line comments and block comments both, and what is left
# is code.
#
# That IS the exemption mechanism, and it is derived rather than listed. There is no
# table of excused files here, deliberately: a hand-kept list is exact about the files
# it knows and silent about the ones it does not, and silence reads identically to
# complete coverage ([#492](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/492)).
# A file that both explains the rule in prose AND breaks it in code is refused, which
# is the shape a partial fix leaves behind.
#
# The blind spot, stated rather than papered over: the token inside a STRING LITERAL
# reads as code here and would be refused. Nothing in this tree does that, and the
# remedy if something ever needs to is to reword rather than to widen the check --
# CMake's regex engine has no lazy quantifier and a literal-aware C++ lexer written in
# `cmake -P` would be a bigger liability than the case it covers.
#
# ## Reading lines
#
# NOT through a list-splitting idiom, and that is a finding rather than a preference:
# writing this check's selftest showed the house reader of the day merged a line ending
# in a backslash with the next one, which its own comment claimed it prevented. The walk
# this check wrote instead now lives in `scripts/lib/CheckCommon.cmake` as
# `pace_scan_code_lines`, with the measurement and the consequences, because
# `check-ranges-seam.cmake` became its second caller.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`: it reads files, compares strings and reports. See
# `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports failure through its
# OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-istreambuf-iterator.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

# Every reference configuration must reach every platform that has a packaging
# format, not just the one whose maintainer noticed.
#
# `packaging/config/` holds the annotated reference files an operator reads and
# edits. They are platform-NEUTRAL by construction -- no absolute path is ever
# live in one, and a setting that must be live and per-platform is appended by the
# installer, which is the only thing that knows the prefix. That is what lets one
# file be the dpkg conffile, the macOS `.default` template and the MSI `.default`
# template all at once.
#
# Nothing enforced that they all get shipped. `pace-node.yaml` arrived
# with #291 as a Linux conffile, and the macOS `.pkg` and the Windows MSI shipped
# NO worker configuration at all until #397 -- so an operator on either platform
# had no annotated reference to start from, and every setting documented only in
# that file was invisible there. Nothing was broken and nothing was logged: the
# file simply was not in two of the three payloads, which reads exactly like a file
# nobody needs.
#
# What this checks, per file under `packaging/config/`:
#
#   1. Linux   -- a `config/<name>|...` row in FASTCACHED_PLATFORM_ASSETS
#   2. macOS   -- a `config/<name>|${FASTCACHED_MACOS_PREFIX}/etc|...` row
#   3. Windows -- an `install(FILES .../config/<name>` under the `if(WIN32)` arm
#
# It reads `packaging/CMakeLists.txt` as TEXT rather than configuring the project,
# for `check-repository-hygiene.cmake`'s reason: it needs no compiler, no generator
# and no platform, so it runs in the default `ctest` set on every host and answers
# about all three platforms from any one of them. A check that could only run on
# the platform it is about is a check that never runs for the other two, which is
# the defect it exists to catch, one level up.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-config-reference-reach.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every reference reaches every payload. 1 = at least one does not.

# reference ships with nothing in force. Every setting is a comment showing its
# default, so there is no live value -- and therefore no live absolute PATH, which

# commit that added this check: 0 live lines of 285 in fastcached.yaml and 0 of 296
# in pace-node.yaml, so the rule holds today and an ordinary edit
# breaks it.
#
# Stated as `nothing is in force` rather than as a path-shaped regex, because a path
# rule underneath this one could never fire, and a check that can only pass vacuously
# reads as coverage. If a reference ever legitimately needs a live setting, a path
# rule is what has to REPLACE this one, and whoever relaxes it meets this paragraph.
#
# What a live per-platform value does instead: the INSTALLER appends it while
# seeding, because the installer is the only thing that knows the prefix. That is

#
# Every case stages a synthetic tree, runs the check over it through a NESTED
# `cmake -P`, and asserts WHICH refusal it got -- not merely that it refused. "It
# refused" and "it refused for the reason this case exists" are different claims and
# only the second one tests anything.
#
# The ACCEPTING arm is first and is not decoration: a check that refused every tree
# would pass every refusing case below, and one stood in this repository for two days.
#
# Judged by OUTPUT rather than by exit code, which is this tree's rule for a
# `cmake -P` check: `message(WARNING)` exits 0 on every CMake while printing

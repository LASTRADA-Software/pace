# A staged POSIX-shell stub that a NON-SHELL spawns is refused unless the test is
# registered off those platforms for a SUBJECT reason (#871).
#
# THE RULE HAD THREE PROSE HOMES AND NO EXECUTOR. `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` applies
# it BY HAND at the `tidy-blind-spots-selftest` registration,
# `.agent/rules/testing.md` restates it and `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md`
# restates it again. Nothing enforced it, so it held exactly as far as whoever wrote
# the next fixture had read.
#
# THE MECHANISM. A `#!/bin/sh` file is started by the KERNEL reading its shebang, and
# only a shell asks the kernel to do that. CMake's `execute_process`, Python's
# `subprocess` and C++'s `CreateProcess` are `CreateProcess` on Windows, which reads
# no shebang and fails ENOEXEC -- "inappropriate file type or format". Git Bash CAN
# start such a stub, so a fixture that runs happily by hand is one the check cannot
# run at all. That exact failure has landed here before (#668's gate self-test).
#
# WHY THE REASON TEXT IS THE DISCRIMINATOR, and this is the whole design. Both of
# these register a fixture off Windows, and they are different claims:
#
#   "Windows cannot start a shebang script"     -- a PORTABILITY excuse. The fixture
#                                                  could be made to work with a
#                                                  `.cmd` stub, and skipping instead
#                                                  silently drops coverage.
#   "the launcher sandbox this needs has no     -- a SUBJECT reason. There is nothing
#    Windows equivalent"                           on this platform to answer, so the
#                                                  skip stands in for no pass.
#
# A check that accepted either would accept the first, which is the one that costs
# coverage. So a `guarded` row's reason is matched against a banned vocabulary and
# refused when it only says the platform cannot start the file.
#
# THREE CLASSES, and the middle one is the remedy the refusal points at:
#
#   data      the stub is never executed -- bytes for a scan to read, or a file a
#             probe merely has to FIND. Not the hazard.
#   adapted   the fixture stages a form the spawner CAN start (a `.cmd` beside the
#             `#!/bin/sh`), so it runs everywhere instead of skipping. The best
#             outcome, and what `reactor-teardown-gate-selftest.sh` did until #1596
#             moved the reactor it gated into core-cpp.
#   guarded   genuinely kept off a platform. Needs a SUBJECT reason.
#
# Collapsing `data` into the hazard would be an over-report: loud, misattributed,
# and it sends somebody to guard a fixture that is already correct.
# `ToolchainProbe_test.cpp` stages FOURTEEN stubs and is deliberately NOT a
# candidate -- it spawns them through a FAKE `IProcessRunner`, so no process is ever
# started and the mechanism list does not match it. That is the scan being narrow on
# purpose rather than missing something.
#
# So the POPULATION is derived and the CLASSIFICATION is stated. A candidate with no
# row is refused, which is what catches a new one ARRIVING; a row whose file is no
# longer a candidate is refused as stale.
#
# RUNS ON WINDOWS, which is where the defect fires, and `cmake -P` is the portable
# vehicle. It stages nothing executable, so it cannot trip its own rule.

# --- the classification table -------------------------------------------------
#
# Rows are `<path>|<class>|<guard>|<reason>`.
#
#   class `data`      the stub is never executed. The reason names what reads it.
#   class `adapted`   the fixture stages an executable form for the spawner. `guard`
#                     is the token that selects it, and it must appear in the file.
#   class `guarded`   something spawns it and the fixture is kept off the platforms
#                     that cannot start it. `guard` must appear in the file, and
#                     `reason` must be about the SUBJECT rather than the platform.
#
# TOTAL: 9 rows, which is the derived candidate count on this tree and is asserted
# against it below rather than restated as a number nobody re-derives.
#
# NO SEMICOLONS in a reason. CMake turns `;` into a list separator, so a reason
# carrying one splits the row and `list(GET parts 3 ...)` reads past the end. The
# first version of this table had three, and the check died on `list index: 1 out
# of range` -- the table format being wrong rather than the tree.

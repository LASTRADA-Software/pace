# The clang-format BUILD this tree is formatted by is one exact release, stated once in
# `.clang-format-version`, and everything that formats agrees with it (#1349, #1407).
#
# ## Why a build, and why this one
#
# `Check C++ style` used to install `clang-format-$CLANG_TOOLS_VERSION` from apt.llvm.org,
# which pins a MAJOR and ships rolling snapshots under it -- so the formatter CI judged with
# changed whenever the mirror did, while every developer machine kept whichever snapshot it
# last installed. Two builds of one major can format one file differently, and a formatter
# at the wrong build REWRITES code the style job accepted, in a diff every line of which is
# "just formatting". The contour-workflows format-on-edit hook did exactly that on every
# C++ edit, with Visual Studio's 22.1.3 against CI's 22.1.8 snapshot, and the remedy read as
# already applied: there IS a binary called clang-format.
#
# So the formatter is PyPI's clang-format release, which is one build with one banner --
# `clang-format version 22.1.8` -- installable natively on Linux, macOS and Windows. Measured
# (#1407): over all 778 tracked first-party C++ files, as they are and with indentation
# stripped, the Linux wheel, the Windows wheel and the apt snapshot built from the same tag
# produce byte-identical output. `.clang-format-version` is the ONE statement of the release:
# the hook reads its banner, and `--requirement` hands installers the pip requirement derived
# from it, so no workflow restates the version.
#
# The banner is the identity, and for a formatter it is enough: a bare release banner is
# printed only by builds of that release tag, and a formatter needs no resource directory, so
# the copied-binary hazard that makes `check-clang-tidy-version.sh` identify its analyser by
# the wheel's RECORD has no formatter counterpart. clang-tidy is declared separately, in
# `.clang-tidy-version`, and nothing here examines it.
#
# ## Five modes, because they are five questions
#
#   (default)             Does the declaration state exactly ONE build, as a bare release
#                         banner `clang-format version X.Y.Z` -- no vendor prefix, no build
#                         suffix -- whose major is the `CLANG_TOOLS_VERSION` build.yml pins?
#                         Reads two files, needs no formatter, runs in the default ctest set.
#                         A second declared build is one the hook would WRITE with; a snapshot
#                         banner names a build no installer can ask for; and a major other
#                         than the toolchain's is a formatter from another LLVM than the
#                         analyser and the compilers.
#
#   --requirement         Print `clang-format==X.Y.Z` for pip, derived from the declaration,
#                         after the default mode's checks. `Check C++ style` installs this.
#
#   --installed <exe>     Is <exe> a declared build? `Check C++ style` asks it of the formatter
#                         it just installed, before formatting, so every green run proves the
#                         declaration. Not a ctest: no build leg installs the formatter, so it
#                         would skip wherever it ran (#1135).
#
#   --resolve             Which clang-format on this machine is the declared build? Prints its
#                         path. `PACE_CLANG_FORMAT`, when set, is the only candidate and is
#                         held to the banner like any other -- an override that is not the
#                         declared build is refused, never stepped over. Otherwise each declared
#                         `binary:` name and then `clang-format`, and for each name EVERY match on
#                         PATH, exactly as the hook resolves -- so a correct build behind an
#                         IDE-bundled one is still found. None: exit 77, with the install commands.
#                         `local-gate.sh`, `Check C++ style` and the windows.h check all format
#                         through this, so there is one answer to "which binary".
#
#   --self-test           Every verdict above, against synthetic trees and fake formatters.
#
# ## The grammar is the hook's, and deliberately strict
#
# Blank lines and `#` comments; otherwise `version: <the whole --version line>` and
# `binary: <clang-format or clang-format-*>`, each repeatable. Any other line refuses. The
# plugin documents the same grammar and refuses the same way, so a declaration this check
# accepts is one the hook can use -- a laxer reader here would pass a file the hook then
# declines on every edit, which is a silent loss of the formatter rather than a wrong one.
# The default mode is STRICTER than the grammar about what this tree declares (one bare
# release); it never accepts a line the hook would refuse.

# `::htonl(...)` is a syntax error on macOS and an ordinary call everywhere else.
#
# The byte-order conversions are function-like MACROS on every platform this
# project builds on -- that is not the difference. The difference is what they
# expand to:
#
#   glibc    `# define htonl(x) __bswap_32 (x)`, guarded by `#ifdef __OPTIMIZE__`.
#            The expansion is a bare global identifier, so `::__bswap_32 (x)` is
#            well-formed. Measured on glibc 2.39/x86-64: `::htonl(1u)` compiles at
#            -O0 (macro not defined) and at -O2 (macro defined and expanded).
#   Darwin   `#define htonl(x) __DARWIN_OSSwapInt32(x)`, always defined. That it
#            FAILS is measured -- CI's macOS leg reports `expected unqualified-id`
#            at the `::`, with a `note: expanded from macro 'htonl'`. WHY is an
#            inference from that error and not a reading: nobody here has a macOS
#            machine, so "the expansion is not a bare identifier, and the `::` has
#            nothing to qualify" is the best explanation of the diagnostic rather
#            than something observed. The rule below does not depend on it.
#
# The earlier explanation in this tree -- "they are macros on macOS and functions
# on glibc" -- was wrong, and wrong in the direction that matters: it suggests the
# rule is about which platform has a macro, which would make this check need to
# know about platforms and `#if` guards. It does not. `::` before these names is
# never necessary and never correct here, so the rule is flat and lexical.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why a check and not a comment.
#
# It has happened three times. The second and third were different lanes,
# different files, hours apart, each costing a CI cycle on a branch that was
# otherwise green. The rule was already written down IN THE SAME FILE, three
# lines above the fixture that violated it -- the same shape AGENT.md records for
# `node-scratch-isolation-e2e`, where a correct paragraph sat three lines above
# the wait that had stopped implementing it. A comment is what already failed
# here; see issue #469.
#
# Nothing else can catch it:
#
#   - Local builds cannot. Nobody here builds macOS locally, and Linux and
#     Windows compile it without complaint.
#   - clang-tidy cannot. The files it appears in are behind `#if defined(__APPLE__)`
#     or `#if defined(_WIN32)`, so on the analyser's Linux host they are EMPTY
#     translation units that report clean -- see issue #466.
#   - CI can, on the macOS leg, one cycle at a time, last.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# No exemption table, deliberately.
#
# Every other scan in this directory has one, because every other scan judges
# something that can legitimately look like a violation. This one cannot: writing
# `::` before a global byte-order call is never required and never correct, so a
# row excusing one would be a hole rather than a decision. A qualified MEMBER --
# `Foo::htonl(x)` -- is legitimate and is not matched; see the pattern below.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P` for the reason check-test-names.cmake gives: it reads files,
# compares strings and reports, so a .sh + .ps1 pair would be two implementations
# of one rule differing only in syntax, and cmake is the one tool guaranteed
# present.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-byte-order-qualifier.cmake
#
# Exit codes: whatever CMake gives it. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error`
# in the output, which is what the FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION on the registration
# reads -- the measurement and the reasons live in
# `scripts/check-script-check-signals.cmake` and are deliberately not restated
# here (#565).

# Under CMP0007 OLD, `list()` DISCARDS empty elements -- every blank line in every
# file scanned here -- so a reported line number would be off by however many
# blank lines precede it. The declaration below sets CMP0007 along with every
# other policy of that vintage; it replaced a hand-set `if(POLICY CMP0007)`
# block, which covered only the one trap somebody had already met.

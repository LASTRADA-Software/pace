# No MSVC-style link in a debug-info configuration is incremental.
#
# `cmake/IncrementalLink.cmake` rewrites CMake's `/debug /INCREMENTAL` defaults to
# `/INCREMENTAL:NO`, because an incremental relink of a test executable failed with LNK1163
# five times on one host and a plain retry then linked (the evidence, and why the rewrite is
# not gated on the compiler cache, are in that file). That rewrite is a CLAIM; the artefact is
# the link line. A normal variable set in the wrong scope, a target that adds its own
# `/INCREMENTAL`, or a CMake that stops reading the variable would each leave a build that
# configures cleanly and links incrementally again. So this reads `build.ninja`.
#
# ## What is judged
#
# Every EXECUTABLE, SHARED_LIBRARY and MODULE_LIBRARY link edge of this configuration. Its
# `LINK_FLAGS` must spell `/INCREMENTAL:NO` and no other form of the switch, in either
# introducer and any case -- `/debug` with no `/INCREMENTAL` at all links incrementally by
# default, so absence is refused as well. A static library is archived by lib.exe and has no
# such switch; an edge of another configuration is not this build's.
#
# ## Outcomes
#
# A judged edge that breaks the rule is REFUSED, by target. So is every way of not being
# able to ask: no judged edge at all, and an anchor (`PaceTest`) whose edge was not
# found and passed. A toolchain that is not MSVC-style, a configuration that carries no debug
# information by default, and a generator that writes no `build.ninja` are each a SKIP naming
# which -- none of them has an `/INCREMENTAL` to judge.
#
# Usage: cmake -DBUILD_DIR=<dir> -DCONFIG=<config> -DMSVC_STYLE=<bool> -DANCHOR=<target>
#          -P check-incremental-link.cmake

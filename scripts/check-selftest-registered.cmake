#
# A script that offers `--self-test` must be REGISTERED to run it (#596).
#
# An unrun self-test is the most expensive kind of green there is. It reads as coverage
# from every direction: the cases exist, they are written carefully, they are cited in
# review, and nothing anywhere says that no target invokes them. The suite passes because
# the suite never asks.
#
# This is not hypothetical and it is not old. `scripts/ci-apt-update.sh` grew a twelve-case
# self-test covering the exact decision that had just broken CI, and no `add_test` named
# it. The allowlist then shipped with the runner's real layout untested and took every
# Linux job down at `Install build tools` (#1160). Twelve cases, none of them ever
# executed, on the one file whose correctness the outage turned on.
#
# ## What counts as OFFERING a self-test
#
# The token is not the offer. `--self-test` appears in this tree inside comments, inside
# usage banners naming ANOTHER script, and inside `printf` strings that stage a fake
# workflow file for a fixture -- `check-tidy-blind-spots-selftest.sh` writes
# `run: bash scripts/tidy-sweep.sh --self-test` into a YAML fixture, and requiring THAT
# file to register a self-test it does not have would be a false refusal on a correct
# tree.
#
# A COMMENT is not a call site, and neither is a STRING LITERAL staging somebody else's
# command line. So the offer is recognised by ARGUMENT DISPATCH, not by the token:
#
#   * a `case` arm  --  `--self-test)`
#   * a comparison against a POSITIONAL PARAMETER on the same line --
#     `[ "${1:-}" = "--self-test" ]`, `[[ "${1:-}" == "--self-test" ]]`
#   * PowerShell  --  `[switch]$SelfTest` in a param block
#   * Python  --  the flag tested against `sys.argv`, or declared to `argparse`
#
# Those cover every offering script here. Python's is the one that most needed
# saying: `tidy-blind-spots-legs.py` holds `NOT_A_SWEEP = ("--self-test",)`, a quoted
# token on a CODE line naming ANOTHER script's mode, and it is not an offer. No
# pattern can tell that from one, so it says so with a `selftest-offer:` marker -- the
# same mechanism `check-tidy-blind-spots-selftest.sh` uses for the same reason.
#
# ## A spelling this table cannot read REFUSES
#
# Reporting the count was not enough, and the reason is the direction of failure. A new
# dispatch spelling makes the offering count fall by one, in a two-digit number nobody has
# memorised, printed on a line that says the run PASSED. So the file is silently
# not-counted, and "not counted" and "does not offer" are one number. (The figure is not
# restated here: the run prints it, and a second copy of a live number is a second source
# of truth that drifts while both claim to be current.)
#
# A file whose token appears on a line that is not a comment, and in which no shape is
# recognised, is therefore REFUSED. That predicate is asked of the whole content rather
# than by walking, so the immunity the pre-filter buys below is kept: a token that appears
# only in comments is documentation and says nothing.
#
# There are TWO states in which that happens, and they are separate reachability cases
# rather than one rule with two examples:
#
#   * the whole-file pre-filter rejects the file, so no line is ever examined
#   * the pre-filter accepts and every line then fails to match, so the two filters
#     DISAGREE -- which is the state a genuinely new spelling arrives in
#
# Both are refused, at their own site. The self-test drives one case at each, and it took
# the mutation matrix to establish that: deleting the second refusal outright changed no
# verdict, because the case written for it was reaching the FIRST site. Its staged body
# spelled the flag `\"--self-test\"`, so the character after the token on disk is a
# backslash rather than a quote and the pre-filter's `["\']--self-test["\']` never
# matched. A case can be green, correctly named, and testing the neighbouring branch.
#
# The one legitimate case in this tree is a fixture STAGING somebody else's command line --
# `check-tidy-blind-spots-selftest.sh` writes `bash scripts/tidy-sweep.sh --self-test` into
# a YAML fixture. That is not an offer, and it cannot be told from one by any pattern, so
# it says so in its own file:
#
#   # selftest-offer: <why this file's token is not an offer>
#
# An EMPTY reason is refused. A placeholder would spell "forgot" in the vocabulary of
# "decided", which is the distinction `RefuseWithoutCounter` exists to keep.
#
# ## `.cmake` self-tests offer by their NAME
#
# A `cmake -P` self-test has no `--self-test` flag to offer: the FILE is the mode, and
# `scripts/check-<x>-selftest.cmake` is invoked as its own script. So for `.cmake` the
# offer is the NAME, and the registration must invoke it -- `-P` and the file name on one
# line -- which is the exact analogue of requiring the flag to be PASSED for a shell
# script. A registration that merely mentions the name runs nothing.
#
# This scanned only `*.sh` and `*.ps1` until #1220, so 23 `*-selftest.cmake` files were
# outside it entirely -- including this check's own self-test. All 23 are registered
# today, so widening changes no verdict now; it is the direction of failure that decides
# it, exactly as for the recursive glob below. Over-broad fails CLOSED.
#
# ## Why the MODE must be registered, and not merely the script
#
# #596 asks that an offering script "appear in an `add_test` COMMAND". That is weaker than
# the defect requires, and the tree contains the counterexample: `check-mkdocs-validation.sh`
# offers `--self-test` and was registered ONCE, in its plain mode. It appears in the table,
# it satisfies the weaker rule, and its self-test had still never run. So what is required
# here is a registration that PASSES the flag.
#
# ## Why the walk never builds a CMake list
#
# `file(STRINGS)` and every `string(REPLACE "\n" ";")` idiom hand the content to CMake's
# list parser, which reads an unbalanced `[` or `]` as structure and merges elements. The
# standing remedy in this tree is to blank the brackets before splitting -- and it is
# WRONG here, because the brackets ARE the data: `[ "${1:-}" != "--self-test" ]` is the
# shell test this check recognises, and blanking it would delete the syntax being matched.
# `check-tsan-scope.cmake` hit the same wall (a Catch2 tag IS `[async]`) and answered it
# the same way. This walks with FIND/SUBSTRING and builds no list at all, so the question
# does not arise.
#
# It is the EIGHTH copy of that walk under `scripts/` -- `check-tsan-scope`,
# `check-test-names`, `check-corrupt-store-diagnostics`, `check-bind-failure-seam`,
# `check-worker-refusals-counted`, `scripts/lib/CheckCommon.cmake` (wrapped as
# `pace_scan_code_lines`) and `check-tools-page-installed-set` (wrapped as
# `pace_capture_lines`) already carry one, and neither wrapper is a drop-in here.
# **#495 is the ticket for consolidating them and this is not it.** The citation is what
# keeps this copy inside that ticket's audit rather than hiding from it -- an
# uncited copy is one #495 will not find.
#
# ## Cost
#
# Conditions, stated rather than pointed at, because a measurement is a quantity UNDER
# conditions and the citation is where they get lost: Windows 11, Git Bash, native NTFS,
# CMake 4.3.1-msvc1, 67 scanned scripts, minimum of seven runs. Taken back to back --
# an earlier session measured a 90 ms process floor where these runs measure 47 ms, on
# the same machine, so figures from different sittings are not comparable and only the
# rows within one block are.
#
#     empty `cmake -P` (process floor)         47 ms
#     line walk, before #1168                 330 ms   (283 ms of work)
#     token jump                              155 ms   (108 ms of work)
#
# The second property is the one worth having, and it is measured on a COPY of the tree
# so that another lane's file is not edited to take a reading. Those figures are slower
# throughout than the block above -- a different path and a cold cache -- and are to be
# read only against each other:
#
#                                          line walk    token jump
#     the copied tree as it stands            538 ms       225 ms
#     + ONE comment line carrying a QUOTED
#       token in the 4,103-line
#       check-e2e-helpers.sh                  917 ms       207 ms
#
# So a line walk's cost is a property of a file's LENGTH, and one sentence written in an
# unrelated file cost it 379 ms. That was a trap laid for whoever wrote the sentence
# rather than a cost anybody chose, and the whole-file pre-filter below existed to buy
# immunity from it. The token-jump walk has that immunity intrinsically: cost is a
# property of how often a file MENTIONS the flag, which is what the question is about.
# The pre-filter stays anyway -- it is what makes the two-filter DISAGREEMENT detectable,
# which is #1220's refusal.
#
# Both walks were compared as SETS and not as counts, because two totals agreeing is
# weak evidence -- a file gained and a file lost cancel exactly. Instrumented to print
# every file read as offering and the shape recognised, the two listings are identical:
# 36 files, same shapes. The comparison carries its own controls, since a `diff` of two
# empty listings agrees perfectly: the listing must be non-empty, and removing one row
# must make it compare unequal.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-selftest-registered.cmake
#
# Exit: the verdict is the OUTPUT, not the status -- `message(FATAL_ERROR)` is read
# through `FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`, because a `-P` script that merely WARNS exits 0.

#
# Split with the bracket-blanking idiom rather than the list-free walk used for the
# scripts. It is safe HERE and not there, and the difference is the data: what gets
# matched against this content is a script NAME and a FLAG, neither of which can contain

#   * RUNS ITS SELF-TEST  --  the name, then whitespace that may include one newline,

    # token. Cost was a property of a file's LENGTH.

    # recovered by a REVERSE find for the preceding newline over the exact text between
    # the last line consumed and the token, and a forward find for the next one. Both
    # are exact, so the line handed to the patterns below is the WHOLE line, byte for
    # byte the one the line walk produced, at any length.
    #
    # A bound would have been the weaker answer twice over: it would make the verdict

# Every ticket a pull request's COMMITS say it closes must also be named by a closing
# keyword in its BODY.
#
# ## Why both, rather than one instead of the other
#
# They do different jobs and neither substitutes for the other:
#
#   * the COMMIT trailer, one per ticket, is what makes a ticket findable and EXCISABLE
#     on a batch branch -- `git log --grep` re-derives the boundaries after a rebase,
#     which is the only reliable way once every SHA has moved;
#   * the BODY keyword is what the merge acts on.
#
# Measured across one day's merges (#974): #955, #953 and #961 carried the keyword in
# both and closed #893, #901 and #208; #959 carried it only in its commits and left #826
# and #866 OPEN. Every close event that worked has NO `commit_id` in the issue timeline,
# which is what a body-keyword close looks like -- nothing in the sample was closed by a
# commit trailer.
#
# A delivered ticket that stays open is indistinguishable from one nobody has started.
# #826 sat inside the `type/bug` count for a day after merging; a batch of eight does
# that eight times at once.
#
# ## The direction it reports and does not refuse
#
# Requiring the body keyword creates a second hazard, and this check is where it has to
# be visible: excising a ticket from a batch removes its commits and leaves the body
# promising to close it. That closes something undelivered, which is worse than one
# staying open -- an open ticket gets re-triaged, a wrongly closed one does not. But an
# unbacked body keyword is ORDINARY in the common case (a change with no trailer), so a
# refusal would be wrong. It is named on every run instead.
#
# ## The DECISION is a pure function, and that is deliberate
#
# Acquisition (a `gh` call) and judgement are split, so the self-test drives staged
# records rather than a live pull request -- the shape `node-scratch-isolation-e2e`
# arrived at after its own timing measurements could not be staged.
#
# bash 3.2: macOS ships a 2007 /bin/bash and this runs in the default ctest set.

`--list-closing` exists so `check-rulebook-open-work.sh` can ask which tickets a pull
request will close WITHOUT restating GitHub's keyword pattern. A second copy of that
pattern is not a cross-check, it is a second thing to be wrong (#1016).

# checker more permissive than the thing it stands for would pass a body that closes
# half of what it claims.

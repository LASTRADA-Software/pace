# A hygiene check traverses each directory once, not once per file pattern.
#
# `file(GLOB_RECURSE var a b c)` traverses the tree **once per pattern**, and the call
# site reads as a single glob. That is what made the cost invisible:
# `check-sccache-backend-caveat` handed it ~19 patterns per root across two calls, and
# on a DrvFs checkout — a supported working environment — it took **78.7 s against a
# 60 s budget**, so the documented local gate could not go green for anyone working
# that way ([#502](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/502)).
#
# ## The measurement, with its conditions, because the number alone misleads
#
# One `GLOB_RECURSE` traversal of `src/`, DrvFs, warm: **2.09 s** (2102, 2101, 2093,
# 2086, 2091 ms — stable to 16 ms). On a native filesystem the same traversal is
# effectively free, which is why this is invisible on CI and on ext4.
#
#     check                     standalone   single gate   two lanes   budget
#     byte-order-qualifier          19.6s        28.6s          60.9s     60s
#     worker-refusals-counted        5.5s         9.7s              -     60s
#     net-boundary                   4.0s         8.6s              -     60s
#
# The `sccache-backend-caveat` row that used to head that table has been removed
# rather than refreshed. It moved twice — 78.7 s before #502, 4.0–5.1 s standalone
# after it, and 53–57 s under three or four concurrent lanes (#479) — and a copy
# here would be a fourth place holding a figure for one check, which is the defect
# #479 was filed about. `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` carries the rows with
# their conditions, and that check now MEASURES and prints its own cost on every
# run. Read it there, or read what the check itself just said.
#
# **Read the conditions, not the number.** A future reader who measures
# `byte-order-qualifier` single-gate gets 28.6 s and concludes it is comfortable. It
# was observed at **60.9 s — over budget — while a second lane's gate was running**,
# and this repository routinely has two and three lanes gating at once. That is the
# only condition under which it has been seen to fail, and dropping it turns a
# reproducible failure into a mystery. This project has already paid for a figure
# quoted without its conditions once.
#
# ## What this check enforces, and what it CANNOT see
#
# **The rule: `file(GLOB_RECURSE)` receives exactly one pattern, and that pattern is
# not an unquoted variable expansion.**
#
# The second clause is load-bearing rather than pedantry. The original defect was
# spelled `file(GLOB_RECURSE rootFiles LIST_DIRECTORIES false ${rootGlobs})` — **one
# argument token, nineteen patterns**. A guard that counted arguments would have passed
# the very code this ticket was opened about.
#
# **This is a PROXY for the real invariant, which is traversals per root, and it is
# worth writing down exactly where the proxy stops:**
#
#   - **A loop defeats it.** Nineteen single-pattern `GLOB_RECURSE` calls inside a
#     `foreach` cost precisely what one nineteen-pattern call costs, and pass this
#     check. Somebody tidying a long argument list into a loop would make this guard
#     greener while reintroducing the cost in full.
#   - It says nothing about how many ROOTS are walked, only about patterns per call.
#   - It says nothing about the size of what is walked; globbing a build tree is a
#     separate mistake, and one this project has also made.
#
# A guard whose limits are written down is worth having. One that reads as complete
# and is not is the shape this repository keeps finding, so the limits are stated here
# rather than discovered later by someone trusting it further than it goes.
#
# Scope is `scripts/*.cmake`: these run in the DEFAULT ctest set, on every developer's
# machine, against a wall-clock budget. A `GLOB_RECURSE` in a `CMakeLists.txt` runs at
# configure time, once, and is a different question.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check
# reports failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-glob-traversals.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

# A `cmake -P` script has no project, so every policy starts unset and CMP0057
# (`if(... IN_LIST ...)`) is one of them. Stated as a minimum version so the whole set
# moves together with the project's own.

# Install the built .rpm on an RPM distribution, under a real systemd, and drive
# both services it ships.
#
# The packaging job builds the .rpm on a Debian-family runner and, until this
# script, only ever INSPECTED it: its file list, its %config markings, and a
# retired-conffile upgrade unpacked into a throwaway root. Nothing installed it
# where rpm resolves its dependencies, nothing ran its scriptlets, and no service
# it ships was ever started from it. The .deb got all of that on the runner's own
# systemd; the .rpm got none of it, while being the package every Fedora and
# RHEL-family machine runs.
#
# And neither package started the compile worker with a disk tier, which is how
# #1674 shipped: the unit's ProtectSystem=strict left the documented
# `cache_dir: /var/cache/pace-node` read-only, and the node refused to start
# ("--cache-dir cannot create /var/cache/pace-node: Read-only file system").
# Reproduced in exactly this container against the 0.5.0 .rpm, which is what the
# worker leg below is for.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS, in order:
#
#   install   `dnf install` of the file resolves its dependencies on Fedora and
#             runs %post: the service accounts exist, and a FRESH install has
#             enabled and started pace-kv.
#   daemon    pace-kv runs as its own account, logs readiness to the journal
#             (so it is not daemonizing), round-trips a set/get, keeps its config
#             at 0640 root:pace-kv and readable by that account, applies a
#             SIGHUP reload, and stops with Result=success.
#   takeover  enabling the node's socket while pace-kv runs stops pace-kv
#             and binds 6674 -- the node supersedes the plain daemon (#1676);
#   boot      with BOTH enabled, a boot comes up with the node's socket holding
#             6674 and pace-kv inactive;
#   worker    the socket activates pace-node with a memory AND a disk
#             tier at /var/cache/pace-node, the service adopts the socket,
#             runs as pace-node, opens its store there, and stops cleanly.
#   upgrade   a reinstall keeps an operator's edit to a %config(noreplace) file.
#   removal   `dnf remove` takes the units away and leaves no enablement symlink.
#
# WHY A CONTAINER WITH systemd AS PID 1, AND WHY --privileged: the units are the
# subject, hardening included (ProtectSystem=strict, PrivateTmp, RestrictNamespaces,
# a seccomp filter), and systemd can only apply that sandbox where it may create
# namespaces and mounts. An unprivileged container would fail those services for a
# reason that is the container's, not the package's.
#
# The base is Fedora from quay.io rather than Docker Hub, whose anonymous pull
# limit is shared by every job on a runner's address.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/rpm-package-e2e.sh <path/to/pace-*.rpm> [base-image]
#
# Needs docker. Exit 0 on success, 1 on any failure -- including docker being
# absent: this runs where it was asked for, and a run that could not happen is
# not one that passed.

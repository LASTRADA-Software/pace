# Which `-fdebug-prefix-map` rules a pair of roots deserves — checked as a pure
# computation, over the layouts nobody has locally.
#
# `cmake/portable/CompileCache.cmake` appends those rules so a replayed object
# names no checkout (#203). The rules themselves are two strings derived from two
# other strings, and that derivation was wrong twice before it was ever run: once
# with a trailing separator that stopped the rewritten path matching the spelling
# the build system passes, and once emitting a "relative" replacement that
# carried the whole checkout path inside it and therefore fixed nothing while
# reading as a fix.
#
# Neither is visible in the layout a developer has. Both are one row here.
#
# Verdict is read from the output, not the exit code, because that is the contract
# every `cmake -P` check here is registered under: see src/tests/CMakeLists.txt,
# which registers this with FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, and the measurement and the
# reasons live in `scripts/check-script-check-signals.cmake` and are deliberately
# not restated here (#565).

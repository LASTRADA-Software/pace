# No first-party C++ walks an enum's enumerators by hand now that
# `src/Pace/Core/EnumTable.hpp` offers `Enumerators<Enum>()`.
#
# ## Why the seam exists
#
# Ten sites spelled the same walk before #1441 -- `std::views::iota` from zero to
# `EnumeratorCount<Enum>` and a `static_cast<Enum>(index)` in the body -- which is an index
# where the code wanted an enumerator. One of them even compared
# `static_cast<std::size_t>(route.match) != kind`, casting the enumerator back out again to
# meet the index it had been given. `Enumerators<Enum>()` is a view of the enumerators
# themselves, and `Enumerators(Enum from)` the tail of them, so the cast disappears.
#
# ## Why a check and not only the seam
#
# Because nothing refused the hand-spelled form, which is the whole reason there were ten.
# The guidelines forbid C-style loops and say to prefer range views, and every one of those
# ten obeyed both -- `views::iota` IS a range view. The defect is not the loop shape, it is
# walking indices to reach enumerators, and no existing check can see that.
#
# ## What is scanned
#
# First-party C++, DERIVED rather than listed: every tracked C++ source (`git ls-files`, or a
# directory walk where there is no index), minus the third-party roots read from
# `scripts/lib/third-party-roots.txt` -- vendored code is not ours to edit, and is counted as
# declined rather than dropped silently. Tests count: the seam is as available to them.
#
# ## What is refused, and what is deliberately NOT
#
# Two line-local shapes, in code with comments stripped, so prose explaining the rule is not
# read as breaking it:
#
#   1. `views::iota` on the same line as `EnumeratorCount<` -- the #1441 shape exactly.
#   2. a `for` or `while` whose bound is `EnumeratorCount<`, on one line.
#
# **A `static_cast<...>(x)` near an `EnumeratorCount<` is NOT refused, and that was measured
# rather than assumed.** The obvious third pattern matches six sites in this tree and every
# one of them is legitimate -- `static_cast<std::size_t>(raw) >= EnumeratorCount<E>` in
# `Consensus/RaftTypes.hpp` and `apps/pace-cc/Stats.cpp`, which are BOUNDS CHECKS on a
# value arriving off a wire, not walks. A check on that pattern would refuse correct code,
# which is why shape 2 requires `for`/`while` on the line: `>=` is a range test and `<` in an
# `if` may be one too.
#
# Also not covered, said here so the next reader does not over-apply the rule:
#
# - a walk split across lines, with the bound on its own continuation line. This is
#   line-local like every reader in this tree; `check-ranges-seam.cmake` has the same limit.
# - the C-style three-clause `for` over an enumerator count. That belongs to #1452, which
#   widens `check-test-loops` from the test tree to production, and duplicating it here would
#   report one defect twice.
#
# ## Why the seam's own existence is derived
#
# The anchor is `Enumerators` in the seam header. If that declaration goes away the check is
# refusing sites for a facility that no longer exists, so a missing anchor is a REFUSAL and
# never read as "nothing to enforce" -- the direction a restated list fails in silently.
#
# Exempt, derived from the one path rather than listed: the seam header itself, which
# implements the walk, and its test beside it by the house `Foo.hpp` / `Foo_test.cpp`
# convention. The enumeration is asserted to have REACHED the header, so an exemption cannot
# be satisfied by a scan that never looked.

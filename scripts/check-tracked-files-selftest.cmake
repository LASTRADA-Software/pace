# Drives `fastcached_tracked_files` in `scripts/lib/CheckCommon.cmake` over staged trees.
#
# ## Why this file exists at all
#
# Before #1485 the enumeration was eight byte-identical copies, which is eight chances for one
# of them to enumerate a different set than the rule it enforces claims to cover. Consolidating
# them removes those eight chances and **adds one**: every enumerating check now reads its file
# set through this one function, so a defect here is a defect in all of them at once, and it
# would be silent in the direction that matters -- an over-broad enumeration reports on files a
# rule was never written for, an under-broad one reports clean over files it never read. A
# consolidation whose single point of failure has no guard on it has moved the risk rather than
# removed it. #1485's acceptance says so in as many words.
#
# ## What is asserted, and why it is these things
#
# **The MODE is part of the answer and every case asserts it.** There are three, they cover
# different file sets, and CI takes the git one: a guard whose self-test exercised the walk while
# CI exercised git has already shipped in this tree and passed, because the mode under test was
# not the mode in use.
#
# **The third mode is the one the copies could not say.** `git ls-files` succeeding and naming
# NOTHING is a different event from there being no index, and every copy reported the latter for
# both -- a true-sounding sentence about the environment that is false. A fresh `git init` with
# nothing staged produces it, which is the shape a staged tree naturally has, so this is not a
# hypothetical state: it is the state most self-tests in this repository are actually in.
#
# **That a FILTER applies in BOTH modes is asserted as an EQUALITY between them**, not as two
# separate counts that happen to look right. A filter living in the pathspec on one side and in
# the glob on the other passes every per-mode assertion and still covers two different sets.
#
# ## In-process for answers, a subprocess for refusals
#
# The answer cases call the function directly: the decision is a pure computation over a
# directory, so there is nothing to gain from an interpreter in between and a count is easier to
# read than a wrapped diagnostic. The refusal cases cannot be in-process -- `message(FATAL_ERROR)`
# would end this script rather than be observed -- so they run a generated driver under
# `cmake -P` and the verdict is read from its OUTPUT, flattened first, because CMake wraps
# diagnostics at a column that depends on the scratch path's length.

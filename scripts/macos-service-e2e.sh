# End-to-end test of the macOS launchd integration (user scope, no root needed).
#
# Asserts the properties the plist generator promises, against a real launchd
# rather than against the generated XML — each of these has a failure mode that
# leaves every unit test green:
#
#   1. Registers and RUNS        — bootstrap alone leaves the job loaded but
#                                  unstarted ("pended ... speculative"), so the
#                                  installer reported success while nothing
#                                  listened. Requires a live pid, not just a
#                                  registration.
#   2. Not a reaped fork         — a plist carrying --daemon double-forks and
#                                  launchd reaps it instantly as "exited".
#   3. Serves the protocol       — the job is reachable on its configured port.
#   4. Reinstall is idempotent   — bootout is asynchronous, so a second install
#                                  used to race it and fail with "Bootstrap
#                                  failed: 5: Input/output error".
#   5. Uninstall leaves nothing  — no job, no plist.
#
# Uses a non-default service name and port throughout, so it can never disturb
# a real pace-kv installed on the same machine.
#
# Usage:
#   macos-service-e2e.sh --pace-kv <path> [--port <n>]
#
# Exit codes: 0 = all assertions held; 1 = a failure; 77 = a runtime
# prerequisite was missing (skip).

# The shared helpers: `fail` and `wait_for_port`, one copy for every POSIX
# fixture (#449). Neither of the two this file had was wrong; both were the
# smallest of the seven, and small is how a copy loses a guard -- this
# `wait_for_port` had no liveness check and no bound of its own worth the name,
# so a job launchd had started and lost was reported as a port that never
# answered.
#
# WHAT CHANGED FOR THIS FIXTURE, deliberately: the local `wait_for_port`
# RETURNED 1 and both call sites wrote `|| fail "nothing listening ..."`. The
# shared one fails the run itself, with a message naming the bound, the measured
# elapsed and whether the job was still alive. The two call sites therefore lose
# their `|| fail`, which was the only use either made of the return value, so
# the step still fails at the same point with the same status 1 and a better
# sentence. Nothing here treats a closed port as an ordinary outcome; a caller
# that did would use `port_answers`.

# Every SHIPPING configure in a workflow is followed, in its own job and before
# that job's build, by the instruction-set check (#1450).
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# #1442 put `scripts/check-instruction-set-flags.sh` into the three `Package`
# jobs, and that step is the only thing that reads what SHIPS: the macOS package
# is configured by a hand-written `cmake` line that no `ctest` leg configures, so
# nothing else in the tree sees those flags at all.
#
# Nothing made a FUTURE shipping configure get the step. A fourth packaging job, a
# new configure line in an existing one, or the step reordered below the build
# would ship with no instruction-set check, and **every required context would
# stay green, because `Package` jobs are not required contexts.** This is the
# rulebook's *a rule stated in the files that obey it reaches no file that does
# not*: the obligation lived only in the three steps already honouring it.
#
# ## The selector is DATA, not three job names
#
# A shipping configure is a step whose `run:` invokes `cmake` with
# `-DPACE_BUILD_TESTS=OFF` -- the one property separating what a customer
# receives from what `ctest` measures. A fourth packaging job is then something
# the selector FINDS rather than something somebody remembered to add.
#
# The step's body is JOINED before it is tested, and that is load-bearing: the
# macOS configure spells `-DPACE_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \` on a continuation line
# of its own, so a line-wise selector finds two of the three and reports clean.
# The joining is the shared walk's (`scripts/lib/workflow-walk.awk`, #1456), which
# is also why this check knows a step's ORDER in its job without counting columns.
#
# ## Four verdicts, not one flag
#
# The guard must exist in the same job, precede that job's build, carry no `if:`
# and carry no `continue-on-error:`. The last two are different mechanisms --
# reporting without gating, and gating without failing -- so they are named
# separately: a refusal naming the wrong one sends somebody to delete the wrong
# line.
#
# ## The Dockerfile, which is exempt by row and by reason
#
# `Dockerfile` carries a shipping configure too, and it cannot have this step: the
# image is built and run inside one CI job and pushed to no registry, so nothing
# it compiles reaches a customer CPU. It is a row in
# `scripts/check-shipping-configure-guard-exemptions.txt` with that reason, and a
# row that has stopped describing a real shipping configure is refused as STALE.
#
# ## Zero shipping configures is a REFUSAL
#
# Every verdict here is about something MISSING, so over a file this could not
# read each one would answer *nothing to vouch for*. **Absence of the negative is
# not the positive**: it reports how many shipping configures it read and how many
# steps the walk placed, and refuses on zero of either.

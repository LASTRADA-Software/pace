# `counter-index-seam` must be SEEN to refuse, on each thing it claims, and to accept
# on nothing else (#1366).
#
# The cases a passing check cannot be told apart from are the vacuous ones:
#
#   `none`       -- nothing converts anywhere, as after the converter is renamed. Every
#                   file is then clean, and a check without a vacuity refusal passes
#                   forever.
#   `stale`      -- the allowed file holds fewer conversions than its row says. The row
#                   then vouches for a conversion that has moved, and waves through the
#                   next one written there.
#   `extra`      -- a SECOND conversion inside the one allowed file, which a per-file
#                   allow without a count would accept.
#
# And the opposite direction, which is how a guard gets deleted rather than fixed:
# `prose` (a comment spelling the cast), `plural` (a cast of `counters.size()`, a
# different name) and `adjacent` (a cast whose TABLE row names a counter after the cast
# closes) must all be accepted.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check
# reports failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DFASTCACHED_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-counter-index-seam-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

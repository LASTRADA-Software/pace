# sccache smoke test (POSIX). Start pace-kv, point sccache at it over the
# chosen wire protocol, compile a one-file program twice, and assert the
# second compile is served from cache. Shared by the CI smoke jobs and the
# CTest `smoke` tests so both exercise exactly the same path.
#
# Usage:
#   sccache-smoke.sh --pace-kv <path> [--protocol memcached|redis]
#                    [--port <n>] [--compiler <cxx>] [--expect-flavor <name>]
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every assertion held; 1 = ran and something was wrong; 77 = a
# runtime prerequisite (sccache / pace-kv / compiler / a backend that is not
# compiled into this sccache) was missing.
#
# **77 IS A SKIP UNDER CTEST AND A JOB FAILURE IN CI**, and the difference is not
# this script's to reconcile. CTest is told what 77 means (`SKIP_RETURN_CODE`);
# a GitHub Actions `run:` step is not, and none of the three smoke jobs carries
# `continue-on-error`, so 77 there fails the step and reddens a REQUIRED context.
# Both readings are correct for their caller: on a developer box an sccache built
# without the backend is a genuinely absent prerequisite, while in CI the sccache
# is installed by the job itself and a missing backend means that job is
# misconfigured. Neither is a reason to soften the exit -- it must simply never be
# reached on a healthy runner.
#
# ## What this asserts, and why one assertion was never enough
#
# The original assertion was `Cache hits >= 1` alone, and sccache satisfies that
# from its own LOCAL DISK cache -- so the fixture passed with no pace-kv in the
# picture at all, for as long as it existed (#1318). Three questions have to be
# asked, because each is satisfied by the failing state of the next:
#
#   1. is the backend even IN this sccache        -- `Enabled features:`
#   2. did sccache USE it, or fall back silently  -- `Cache location`
#   3. WHICH DIALECT did it speak                 -- the daemon's own log
#
# (3) is not pedantry: `sccache smoke (memcached text)` exists to cover the
# memcached TEXT protocol, and `Cache location` reports the backend TYPE, so a
# binary-speaking sccache reports `memcached, name: memcached, prefix: /` exactly
# as a text-speaking one does. Without (3) that leg could exercise binary, pass
# everything, and go on claiming text coverage -- which is this ticket's own
# defect re-established deliberately.

#
# What that costs is a MISATTRIBUTION rather than a missed failure: since #1318 the

# outcome is printed beside it.
#
# Asserted POSITIVELY, by the configured backend's name: the negative -- "does not

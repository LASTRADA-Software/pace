# The operator-facing port documentation must agree with `NodeSurfaceTable()`,
# which is the one place a node's surfaces are declared.
#
# A port table is the document somebody writes firewall rules from. Wrong here
# costs a closed port on a machine that needed it open, or an open one that did
# not -- and one of these documents is a hand-pasted `--print-surfaces`
# transcript, which looks like machine output and is a string in a markdown file.
# A reader has no way to tell it from the real thing (#462).
#
# ## Both directions, because one of them is the dangerous one
#
# Every surface the table declares must appear, AND nothing surface-shaped may
# appear that the table does not declare. A scan that only walks the table passes
# a document that has grown a port the binary never opens -- which for a firewall
# worksheet reads as authorisation to open something.
#
# ## Why there is a COUNT rule as well as a row rule
#
# This is the part nobody will reconstruct, so it is written down. The row rule
# cannot see prose. #290 merged three ports into one, #290 stage 3 then corrected
# every port NUMBER by hand, and the two things that survived that hand-edit were
# both sentences rather than table rows:
#
#     cluster-communication.md   "carries the full six-surface table"   (it has four)
#     pace-node.md  "Five TCP rules and one wrong one"     (there are three)
#
# The second sits directly under a correct four-row table, and an operator counts
# firewall rules from it. Neither is reachable by comparing rows to rows.
#
# ## Why the count rule is anchored where it is
#
# `surface` means two different things in these documents, and that is not sloppy
# writing -- it is what #290 left behind. There are FOUR ports (this table) and
# THREE policy roles on the node port (cache verbs, compile verbs, scheduler
# verbs), and prose legitimately counts either. So a count rule anchored on the
# word `surface` alone checks two concepts with one regex and fires on correct
# prose, and a rule with a known false-positive class gets disabled by the third
# person it inconveniences.
#
# The anchor is therefore narrow and the residue is REFUSED rather than ignored:
# a phrasing that is a claim about the set of ports is matched by a row of
# `FastCachedSurfaceCountPatterns` and checked, and every other number-plus-
# `surface` collocation must appear in `FastCachedSurfaceCountExemptions` with a
# reason. A new wording is neither checked wrongly nor waved through -- it fails
# until somebody says which of the two senses it is in.
#
# ## What this deliberately cannot see, measured rather than assumed
#
# The count rule requires the number to be ADJACENT to `surface`. Measured on
# this corpus, that misses `distributed-compilation.md`'s "Membership gates
# **two** of a node's surfaces", where four words intervene. Widening the gap
# re-admits the false-positive class the section above exists to avoid, so the
# gap stays narrow and the limit is stated here instead.
#
# It also says nothing about prose naming a port that no longer exists -- "the
# compile port", "its own port". There is no anchor separating those from the
# ports that do exist without a hand-kept list of retired names, which would be a
# second copy of history and would go stale in the direction that reports green.
# Both are limits rather than open work: a check that covers less and is right is
# worth more than one that covers everything and cries wolf.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check
# reports failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-node-surface-docs.cmake

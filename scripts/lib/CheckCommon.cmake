# What the `scripts/check-*.cmake` hygiene checks share.
#
# ## Why there was no such module until now
#
# There were twelve-plus of these checks and not one of them `include()`d another,
# so every common idiom existed three to five times (#495). This is the module that
# ends that, and #513 is the half of it about the `"value|reason"` ROW convention.
#
# ## What was measured before anything moved
#
# #513 recorded four copies under three names and reasoned that three names implies
# three implementations "that may differ". Half of that is wrong, and the half that
# is right matters more than the ticket expected. Measured by extracting every
# definition from `function(` to its matching `endfunction()` and hashing it:
#
#   pace_row_fields          6 copies, ONE digest -- byte-identical
#   pace_split_rows          2 copies, ONE digest -- byte-identical
#   pace_split_account_row   1
#   pace_registration_fields 1
#
# Nine general splitters under four names, not four under three: the tree grew after
# the ticket was filed, and three of the six `pace_row_fields` copies carry a
# comment telling the next author to keep them byte-identical and to count the file
# in when #495 lands. Those comments worked. Within a name there is no divergence at
# all.
#
# ## The divergence is BETWEEN the names, and it is about CMake lists
#
# `pace_row_fields` walks the row with `string(FIND)` and `string(SUBSTRING)`
# and builds no CMake list. The other three all hand text to CMake's list parser:
# `pace_split_account_row` and `pace_registration_fields` through
# `string(REPLACE "|" ";")` and `list(GET)`, and `pace_split_rows` by
# `list(APPEND)`ing into two parallel lists.
#
# The copies were then driven against each other on the awkward rows #513 names --
# an empty field, a value holding the separator, a trailing separator, a row with no
# separator at all -- plus a `;` and an unbalanced bracket in each position. What
# came back is not what the ticket expected, and not what this comment said before
# it was measured:
#
#   row            pace_row_fields    pace_split_account_row
#   a|b|c          a, b, c                  same
#   a|b|           a, b, ""                 same
#   a||c           a, "", c                 same
#   |b|c           "", b, c                 same
#   ab             REFUSED                  REFUSED
#   a|b            REFUSED                  REFUSED
#   a|b|c|d        a, b, "c|d"              REFUSED -- "got 4"
#   a|b|c;d        a, b, "c;d"              REFUSED -- "got 4"
#   a|[b|c         a, "[b", c               REFUSED -- "got 2"
#   [a|b|c         "[a", b, c               REFUSED -- "got 1"
#   a|b|[c         a, b, "[c"               same
#   a|b|c[         a, b, "c["               same
#   a|b|c]d        a, b, "c]d"              same
#
# **Every divergence is about which one REFUSES, and the list-building one always
# refuses LOUDLY.** Not one of them is a silent wrong answer, and an unbalanced
# bracket in the LAST field is inert in both. So consolidating on the list-free
# implementation is a change toward LAXITY, not a silent-defect fix -- two checks now
# accept rows they used to refuse: one with more separators than fields (the last
# absorbs the rest, which is what lets a reason be written in prose), and one whose
# earlier field carries a `;` or an unbalanced `[`.
#
# That is defensible and is the reason it was chosen: the six-copy majority already
# had this contract, refusing a prose reason for containing a `|` is the worse
# outcome of the two, and a row with four fields where three are read folds the
# fourth into text that is only ever printed. But it is a behaviour change and is
# recorded as one rather than described as a repair.
#
# `pace_split_rows` differs from `pace_row_fields` in the refusal WORDING
# alone ("Malformed row (no '|')" against "wanted 2 '|'-separated fields"), on every
# input measured.
#
# One hazard is upstream of all four and none of them can help with it: the row
# TABLES are CMake lists, so an unbalanced bracket or a `;` inside a row merges or
# splits it before any splitter is called. Measured on `check-service-accounts`, an
# unbalanced `[` in a reason takes it from 2 accounts to 1 -- identically before and
# after this consolidation, because the damage is done at `foreach(row IN LISTS ...)`.
# Keep `;` and unbalanced brackets out of row text.
#
# ## What is deliberately NOT reconciled
#
# `pace_split_rows` keeps its parallel-list OUTPUT. That shape is the one
# #495 calls out -- two lists that must be kept in step by hand -- and removing it
# means restructuring ten consumer sites across two checks that want a path list to
# `list(FIND)` in. That is its own change, and doing it inside a consolidation would
# put an unproven refactor of two live hygiene checks behind a rename. What it gets
# here is ONE definition of the convention: where the separator is, which field
# absorbs the rest, and what a malformed row does now live in one function that it
# calls, rather than in a second implementation that can drift from it.
#
# ## No `cmake_minimum_required` here, deliberately
#
# This file is INCLUDED, never run. The includer states the policies -- every
# registered check does, and `check-script-check-signals` pass 3 refuses one that
# does not -- and a declaration here would push a second policy stack onto a scope
# that did not ask for one.

# Split one '|'-separated row into the variables named in ARGN, the last of which
# takes whatever remains -- so only the final field may contain a '|', which is what
# lets a reason be written in ordinary prose.
#
# Never builds a CMake list, so a field containing ';', '\', '[' or ']' is harmless.
# It carries the malformed-row refusal itself, so a caller needs no field-count
# guard of its own.
#
# The row LIST is a separate hazard and this cannot help with it: `set(rows "a;b")`
# splits at the list level before this is ever called. Keep ';' out of row text.
#
# @param row The '|'-separated row.
# @param ARGN Output variable names, in field order.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Splitting file content into lines. TWO functions, not one, and they must not be
# merged (#495).
#
# The eight-plus copies of this looked like one idiom under three names. They are
# not: they are two idioms with OPPOSITE intent, and which one a site wants follows
# from what it does with the line next.
#
#   TOKENISED  the caller is about to parse the line as CMake ARGUMENTS, so `;`,
#              `[`, `]` and `\` are structure that has to be neutralised BEFORE
#              parsing. `check-glob-traversals` reads `file(GLOB_RECURSE ...)`
#              argument lists; blanking is chosen over escaping deliberately,
#              because an escape does not survive a line ending in a backslash and
#              every shell continuation in this repository is one.
#
#   VERBATIM   the caller PRINTS the line with an accurate `file:line`, so the text
#              has to survive. `;` is escaped rather than blanked; `[` and `]` are
#              still blanked, because nothing in this family matches on a bracket
#              and a space preserves every column and line number.
#
# A single shared function would have to pick one, and would break whichever family
# it did not choose -- SILENTLY, because the check would go on passing, having
# matched different text. That is why "split lines" was the wrong name: it is the
# name that hid the difference for eight copies.
#
# ## What was measured before they moved
#
# The count comparison that validates the rest of this module is structurally blind
# here: it sees a check examining a DIFFERENT NUMBER of subjects, and a dropped
# escape or a changed tab produces the same number of DIFFERENT ones. So the copies
# were driven against one another over content carrying a `;`, a balanced bracket
# pair, an unbalanced `[`, a trailing backslash and a tab, and the ELEMENTS were
# compared rather than the count:
#
#   line                A1 (lossy)         A2 (+tabs)         B1 (`\\;`)      B2 (`\;`)
#   "alpha; beta"       "alpha  beta"      same as A1         "alpha; beta"   same as B1
#   "[bracket] pair"    " bracket  pair"   same as A1         " bracket  pair" same as B1
#   "unbalanced [ here" "unbalanced   here" same as A1        "unbalanced   here" same
#   "back\slash tail"   "back slash tail"  same as A1         "back\slash tail" same as B1
#   "<TAB>tab indented" "<TAB>tab indented" " tab indented"   "<TAB>tab ..."  same as B1
#
# Two findings came out of that. The tab map is the ONLY within-family-A difference,
# and it is load-bearing rather than drift -- `check-byte-order-qualifier` spells
# optional whitespace as a plain space class, which CMake's regex engine will not
# match against a tab, so normalising it away would silently stop that check seeing
# tab-indented code. It is a named option here rather than a flattened default.
#
# And `check-target-file-guards` carried BOTH B spellings, in one file: `"\;"` at one
# reader and `"\\;"` at the other, with the bracket blanking on opposite sides of the
# escape. They are byte-identical on every element measured, so converging them is
# safe -- which is worth recording, because "one file spells it two ways" reads like
# a defect and is not one.
#
# ## What is NOT converted, and why
#
# `check-config-reference-reach` splits through an `@PACE_SEMI@` PLACEHOLDER and blanks
# no brackets at all. That is a third strategy, and converting it would change what
# it matches: it keeps `;` inside the element rather than escaping it, and it is
# bracket-EXPOSED where both families here are not. Which of those matters is a
# question about that check's corpus -- exposure is a property of (reader, file,
# surviving lines) and never of the script -- so it is left where it is and named
# here rather than folded in quietly.

# Split content into lines for TOKENISING: `\`, `;`, `[` and `]` become spaces, so a

# One line of C++ with its comments removed, carrying whether a block comment is still open.
#
# The ONE implementation of comment stripping for the line walks below. It was the body of
# `pace_scan_code_lines` and moved out when `check-test-loops.cmake` needed the same
# stripping over whole content rather than a per-line match: the comment-ordering defect
# described inside has already had three copies, and a fourth would be the next.
#
# A string literal's CONTENTS are code here, and that is the whole of why this is a scan rather
# than a pair of regexes. Both of the blind spots this header used to declare were the same
# false GREEN, which is the one direction a check exists to refuse:
#
#   * a `/*` inside a literal opened a block comment. `SocketExchange.cpp:410` carries
#     `"...Accept: */*\r\n..."`, no `*/` follows on that line, and the remaining 51 lines of the
#     file -- a `for (;;)` among them -- were blanked while the caller printed a clean count over
#     lines it had never read. Proof that this was the only such file, and that there was one:
#     a C++ file that COMPILES cannot end inside an unterminated block comment, and exactly one
#     of 915 did.
#   * a `//` inside a literal truncated the line there. 21 lines across 16 files, losing text
#     like `//") == 0)` -- the rest of a `REQUIRE`.
#
# The old header called this "blind to either introducer inside a STRING LITERAL, as every
# regex-shaped reader here is", which reads as a false-POSITIVE risk and is the reason it sat
# for as long as it did. Being blind to a MENTION costs nothing; being blind to a USE is what
# this function exists to prevent.
#
# Two limits remain, and both are stated because neither is a guess:
#
#   * A literal that does not END on its line -- a raw string's first line, 10 of them here --
#     is kept as code from the quote onward, and the scan resumes on the next line outside any
#     literal. So a `/*` inside a raw string's BODY still opens a comment. Keeping the text is
#     the fail-CLOSED direction: a finding somebody can see and exempt, rather than a clean
#     report over what was dropped.
#   * `'` is NOT an opener. 262 lines here are digit separators (`1'000'000`), and treating a
#     quote-shaped character as a char literal would blank the tail of every one of them -- a
#     fix with twelve times the reach of the defect. A `'\"'` therefore opens a literal that
#     usually does not close on its line, which lands on the keep-it-all path above.
#
# Where the string literal opening at @p quoteAt ends, or -1 when it does not end on this line.
#
# Needed because a comment introducer inside a string literal is not one, and the closing quote
# is the only thing that says where the literal stops.
#
# A regex cannot answer it. CMake's engine has no lazy quantifier, so `^"([^"\\]|\\.)*"` runs
# greedily to the LAST quote on the line and reports `"a" + "b"` as a single literal -- which
# would hand back a literal spanning the code between them.
#
# An ODD run of backslashes immediately before a quote escapes it and an even one does not, so

# Scanning C++ for a USE of something, as opposed to a MENTION of it in a comment.
#
# Walk content line by line WITHOUT ever building a CMake list of lines, and report, per
# line, whether @p pattern appears at all (`mention:<line>`) and whether it survives
# comment stripping (`use:<line>`). A mention is counted BEFORE stripping, so a caller's
# matched-nothing guard cannot be satisfied by the stripping alone.
#
# It was `pace_scan_lines` in `check-istreambuf-iterator.cmake` and moved here when
# `check-ranges-seam.cmake` became its second caller: a second copy citing the first in a
# comment vouches for its bugs without inheriting its fixes, and this one has had two.
#
# ## Why list-free
#
# The list-splitting idiom this was written instead of (`pace_read_lines`, before #495
# split it into the two functions above) escaped `;` and `\`, blanked `[` and `]`, then split
# on newlines into a CMake list -- and a line ending in a backslash still merged with the next
# one, which its own comment claimed it prevented. Measured on CMake 3.28 with a four-line
# file: no trailing backslash gave 5 elements, a line ending in `\` gave 4 with lines 2 and 3
# merged into `two \;three`, and a line ending in `\` merged too.
#
# A merged line is not cosmetic for a use-scan: the merged element begins with whatever line 2
# began with, so a `//` comment swallows the real code on line 3, the use goes unreported, and
# every line number below it drifts. That is a false GREEN, the direction that does not get
# investigated. It was found by the `istreambuf-iterator-selftest` case that plants list
# structure ABOVE a violation and asserts the exact `file:line` -- an assertion on the filename
# alone passes under the bug.
#
# So this walks with `FIND`/`SUBSTRING` and puts no line into a list at all: immune to `;`,
# `\`, `[` and `]` by construction rather than by escaping them one at a time.
# `check-tsan-scope.cmake` is list-free for the same reason.
#
# The walk is O(n^2) in the content's length, so a caller applies a whole-file `string(FIND)`
# first and walks only the files that contain the token at all.
#
# @param content The file content.
# @param pattern A CMake regular expression for the thing whose USE is sought.
# @param outVar Set to a list of `mention:<line>` and `use:<line>` entries, in line order.

# Every tracked file a check's rule is ABOUT, and HOW they were found.
#
# Eight `check-*.cmake` readers carried a byte-identical copy of this machinery, and each asks
# a DIFFERENT question with it: `*CMakeLists.txt`, `src/*.cpp` `src/*.hpp`, one subdirectory,
# the test files by pathspec, every tracked C++ source. The census is on #1485. So the thing
# to share is NOT the file set -- that is per check and has to stay so; migrating a check onto
# somebody else's set would silently narrow or widen what its rule is enforced over, which is
# the defect this consolidation exists to remove. What is shared is the MODE SELECTION: the
# work-tree probe, the `ls-files` call, the walk fallback, the exclusion list and the ordering.
#
# `set(excludeNames "out" "build" "_deps" ".git" ".cache" ".claude")` was SEVEN byte-identical
# copies. An exclusion list bets on the world's layout, so seven bets that have to move
# together is the costliest part of the duplication rather than the most visible one.
#
# ## The FILTER applies in BOTH modes, and that is the point
#
# A check whose git path and walk path cover different sets is a guard that enforces one rule
# on a developer's machine and another in CI, and this tree has shipped one (#1476). So a
# filter is applied to every candidate whichever mode produced it, rather than living in the
# pathspec on one side and in the glob on the other where nothing compares them.
#
# ## THREE modes, not two
#
# `git ls-files` succeeding and naming NOTHING is not the same event as there being no index,
# and every copy collapsed them: it fell through to the walk and announced
# `directory walk (no git index)` in a tree that has one. That is a true-sounding statement
# about the environment which is false, and it is the string a self-test case asserts on --
# which is how a guard whose self-test exercised the walk while CI exercised git passed for as
# long as it did. A fresh `git init` with nothing staged produces it, and the self-tests drive
# that shape deliberately, so the fallback stays; what changes is that it says WHY it ran.
#
# ## The fallback is gated on the MODE, never on the list being empty
#
# The copies asked `if(NOT sourceFiles)`, which conflates "no mode answered" with "a mode
# answered and its filter kept nothing" -- so a real git answer whose filter emptied it would
# be overwritten by a walk, and the verdict would name the wrong mode. The mode names what
# ANSWERED, not what came back non-empty.

## Every tracked file matching a question, and how they were found.
## @param sourceDir The repository root.
## @param PATHSPECS git pathspecs for `ls-files --`. Omit for every tracked file.
## @param GLOBS The walk fallback's patterns, relative to sourceDir. Required.
## @param FILTER A regex every candidate must match, in BOTH modes. Omit for no filter.
## @param FILES_OUT Name of the variable to receive the paths, relative to the root and sorted.
## @param MODE_OUT Name of the variable to receive the mode's name, for the caller's verdict.
## @param CONTAINING Literal strings; with CONTAINING_OUT, which files of FILES_OUT hold any of them.
## @param CONTAINING_BYTES Bytes, as two lowercase hex digits from `00` to `7f`; with
##        CONTAINING_OUT, which files of FILES_OUT hold any of them, judged on the true bytes.
## @param CONTAINING_OUT Name of the variable to receive that subset, sorted. FILES_OUT is unchanged.
## @param MISSING_OUT Name of the variable to receive the files of FILES_OUT this tree does not
##        have -- named by the index and absent, or a link to nothing -- sorted. Never a file
##        that is there and unreadable. Without it, a CONTAINING question over such a file is
##        REFUSED by name, since leaving it out of the answer would pass it.
#
# ## CONTAINING: which files a check has to READ
#
# A scan whose rule can only fire on a line carrying some literal reads every file to find the
# few that do. On a DrvFs checkout -- which is where every local gate tree takes its sources
# from -- a read is a 9P round trip, and reading `src/` cost a check seconds a single `git grep`
# spends in under half of one; with two or three lanes gating at once those seconds are what
# took the hygiene checks past their budgets. So the question is asked ONCE, of git, in git mode:
# `git grep -l -F` over the same pathspecs, intersected with FILES_OUT so the FILTER holds. The
# walk has no index to ask and reads each file, which is what every caller did before.
#
# FILES_OUT stays the whole set, so a count a check prints is the count it always printed; a
# file outside CONTAINING_OUT is one whose contents could not have fired the rule. A `git grep`
# that fails, or exits 0 having said ANYTHING on stderr, is not trusted and every file is read
# instead: git exits 0 over a file it could not open, so the status alone would pass that file.
# A file nobody can read is refused by name, whichever path found it.
#
# ## CONTAINING_BYTES: a question about BYTES, which a text read cannot answer
#
# `file(READ)` is not a byte read. Measured: it drops the CR of a CRLF on Windows AND on Linux
# (a 30-byte file with two CRLFs reads as 28), ends at a 0x1A on Windows (nine bytes read as
# one), and while the string it returns HOLDS a NUL, the regex engine stops at one, so nothing
# behind a NUL is ever matched. Every one of those losses reports clean. So a byte needle is
# never looked for in text:
#
#   * git mode asks ONE `git grep -l -a -P` for a class of `\xHH` escapes, under `LC_ALL=C` so
#     PCRE matches bytes rather than code points -- and `-P` because a NUL cannot be passed in
#     an argument, which rules out `-F`. `-a` makes a file git calls binary searched as text,
#     all of it. A git built without PCRE cannot answer; that is SAID, and the walk's reading
#     answers instead, so a missing feature costs time and never a verdict.
#   * the walk reads each file as HEX, which is exact, and matches a token only at a byte
#     boundary (see `pace_files_holding_bytes`).
#
# Restricted to `00`-`7f` because that is where a byte and a code point are the same number in
# every locale either side could be in; nothing here needs more.

# and a dangling link, and not a deleted file -- measured on ext4 under chmod 000. The glob's own
# metacharacters are bracketed so a path is matched as itself.
#
# A link is followed to the END of its chain, never one hop: a link to a link to nothing names a
# directory entry that IS listed -- the middle link -- so stopping there calls it `unreadable`.

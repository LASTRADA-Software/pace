# What the Windows packaging job asserts about the MSI's service table, and the
# msiexec, package and log helpers it asserts through.
#
# ## Why this is a module rather than copies in each step
#
# `Package (Windows .msi)` drives one package through a chain of transactions --
# upgrades from 0.3.0 and from the latest release, upgrades between two builds of
# this one, a fresh install, a feature change, a repair and an uninstall -- and asserts the
# service table after every one. Its steps share no PowerShell scope, so each
# helper would otherwise be pasted once per step, and a copy that drifts is an
# assertion that no longer says what its neighbours say.
#
# ## The subject and the expectation
#
# The subject is `packaging/windows/service-actions.xml`, which decides from the
# features a transaction leaves installed how each service is registered and
# whether it is started. `$script:ServiceTable` below restates that table as the
# EXPECTATION, one row per state a transaction may leave, so an assertion site
# names a row rather than restating start modes. Only the Windows packaging job
# can compare the two, because only it runs the package against a real service
# control manager.
#
# ## What the self-test can and cannot reach
#
# `Invoke-MsiServiceTableSelfTest` drives the service verdict over synthetic
# observations in both directions, the waiting assertion against a service every
# Windows host runs and a name no host has, the package reader over an MSI
# database it creates, the registry walker over a scratch key in HKCU, and the
# firewall snapshot over a group no host has. It installs nothing. Its blind
# spots, each with the direction it fails in:
#
#   * `Get-InstalledProductCodes` is exercised only for an UpgradeCode nothing is
#     installed under, because a non-empty answer needs an installed product.
#     Fails OPEN.
#   * The table's rows are checked for VOCABULARY only -- a known start mode and a
#     known state -- never against the fragment. A row that is wrong the same way
#     the fragment is wrong (both saying pace-kv stays auto beside the node,
#     say) passes here and passes the packaging job, because there the one agrees
#     with the other. Only a reader of both catches that. Fails OPEN.
#   * `Assert-NodeStatePrivate` reads access lists a real install produced; only
#     its pure verdicts run here (stated at the function). Fails CLOSED: it throws.
#   * `Get-InstallationSnapshot` is assembled whole only by the packaging job,
#     which alone has the services, the HKLM keys and the products it reads. Its
#     parts run here -- the walker, the settled state through its observation seam,
#     the comparison over synthetic records -- never the assembly. A field read
#     wrongly reads wrongly on BOTH sides of a comparison, so that fails OPEN; the
#     job's discrimination leg, which requires a successful upgrade to change the
#     fields it names, is what shows those readers live.
#   * `Get-FirewallGroupSnapshot` renders a POPULATED group only on the packaging
#     job; here it reads an absent group live and its error decision through its
#     seam. A line rendered wrongly is wrong on both sides too: fails OPEN.
#   * `Get-SettledServiceState`'s real sleep runs only live; here it is
#     `-StableSeconds 0` through the observation seam.
#   * The transaction judgement (`Invoke-TransactionJudgement`, run by
#     `Invoke-Msiexec` at the exit and by `Assert-TransactionSettled` past it)
#     judges records the packaging job alone acquires over a real transaction.
#     Here the verdict runs over synthetic records, the watch over a real process
#     through a scripted observer, the event parse over every event shape it
#     reads, and the event reader over the real System log in both directions. On
#     a host that writes no 7036 (this repository's Windows 11 26200 development
#     host writes none), a start that lives and dies between two observations
#     WITHOUT terminating unexpectedly and without a 7036 "stopped" is seen by no
#     witness, and the pass line says "7036 NOT SEEN". Fails OPEN there.
#   * A step's LAST transaction is settled only if the step calls
#     `Assert-ServiceTable` or `Assert-TransactionSettled` after it: every other
#     transaction is refused by the next one's `Invoke-Msiexec`, but nothing runs
#     after a step's last. Fails OPEN; every step ends in one today.
#
# And one limit of the assertion itself, not of its self-test: the stability
# window is about five seconds after a row matches. A service that crashes
# within it is caught; one that runs longer before dying -- a node that fails
# its first heartbeat a minute in, say -- still passes.

Set-StrictMode -Version Latest

# A module reads preference variables from its OWN scope chain, not its caller's,
# so a step's `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` does not reach these functions.
# Set here, every failure below ends the transaction's step rather than printing
# and carrying on -- which is what a COM type mismatch did, measured, before this
# line: the error was printed and the next statement ran.

# What a transaction did to the services (PR 1634)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The service table row a transaction leaves is asserted AFTER it, so a service
# that was started during it and died again -- or crash-looped, stopped between
# two recovery restarts at the moment it was asked -- passes the row. That is
# what PR 1634's CI showed (MEASURED): the upgrade from 0.3.0 started FastCached
# at 12:12:47, after the table had made it manual and stopped it for the node;
# it could not bind the port the node holds, terminated three times before
# msiexec returned, and the row read "Manual and Stopped". That Windows
# Installer's Restart Manager started it is INFERRED: nothing in the package
# starts FastCached on that path, and FastCached stopped one second into the
# transaction, at InstallValidate time.
#
# So Invoke-Msiexec JUDGES every transaction it runs, against the row it names
# (`-Leaves`) or a named expectation (`-Expect`), and Assert-ServiceTable judges
# the same transaction again over the longer window that reaches its own
# stability interval. Three witnesses, each a pure function over records:
#
#   * the service control manager's unexpected-termination events (7031, 7034)
#     naming a service of this package since the transaction began;
#   * its "entered the running state" event (7036) for a service the
#     expectation leaves NOT RUNNING (stopped, or not registered);
#   * a process the watch saw such a service run under, other than the one it
#     ran under when the transaction began.
#
# 7036 is a witness only where the host writes it. MEASURED on two hosts: the
# Windows Server 2025 runner of PR 1634's CI writes it (its log printed "The
# FastCached service entered the running state"); this repository's Windows 11
# 26200 development host wrote none among 50,978 System records. So the watch
# stays, and each transaction that starts the node says which of the two hosts
# it ran on: the node's own start is the positive control (Get-Witness7036State).

# Expectations a transaction states when no row honestly describes it, each with
# its reason. A row is the default for everything else, and nothing defaults to
# one of these: Invoke-Msiexec refuses a call that names neither.
#
#   MayTerminate  the services whose unexpected termination this transaction is
#                 BUILT to cause; every other termination is still a finding.
#   MustFail      the transaction fails on purpose: Invoke-Msiexec refuses one that
#                 returns 0, so the exemption is bound to the outcome it is named for
#                 rather than to the call site's -Accept.
#

# stopped, and removes what it created and started, so which service may start
# during it is the rollback's business, not a row's.

# The shared helpers every POSIX end-to-end fixture under `scripts/` uses to draw

# the run.
#
# SOURCED, never executed. There is no `#!` line and the file is not executable,
# so `./e2e-common.sh` is a shell error rather than a script that appears to do
# nothing.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why this is one file rather than one copy per fixture
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# It was seven copies, and the duplication had already produced a defect that was
# silent (#449). Three waits in `dist-compile-e2e.sh` matched the bare word
# `registered`, which also matches `0 of 1 toolchain(s) registered` -- the line a
# node logs after every heartbeat round whatever the outcome. Those waits returned
# for a worker the scheduler had TURNED AWAY, and the fixture then proceeded
# against a fleet it believed was formed. Nothing failed; the property under test
# was simply not being tested.
#
# That is the shape: a fixture passing for a reason unrelated to the thing it
# guards. Seven copies of a wait is seven chances to write the next one slightly
# differently, and a wait that returns for the wrong reason is invisible until
# something downstream fails for an unrelated-looking reason.
#
# The copies had diverged already, and the divergences are worth naming because
# each is a fixture that could not report what it saw:
#
#   * `check-compile-cache-daemon-start.sh`'s `wait_for_port` checked NO liveness
#     at all. A daemon that died at `bind()` was reported as `never answered on
#     port N` after the full bound had burned -- which is precisely the
#     slow-machine-versus-wedged-process confusion `.agent/rules/testing.md`
#     requires be distinguishable, since the two are fixed in different places.
#   * `fleet-dashboard-e2e.sh`'s `http_get` learnt that `read` returns non-zero on
#     a final chunk with no trailing newline, so the loop drops it -- and the JSON
#     document that route serves is ONE line with no newline at all, so the whole
#     body vanished. The fix was never carried back to the other copies, where it
#     is latent today only by luck about which endpoints end in a newline.
#   * `check-compile-cache-daemon-start.sh`'s and `compile-cache-e2e.sh`'s
#     `free_port` had no issued-port ledger, so two draws before either is bound
#     can return the same number and the second process dies of `EADDRINUSE` --
#     a collision that reads as an unrelated flake.
#
# This file is the UNION of the correct behaviours, not their intersection. Every
# fixture gets the liveness check, the trailing-chunk fix and the ledger, because
# the alternative -- preserving each caller's current behaviour -- preserves the
# three bugs above under the name of compatibility.
#
# It has its own test (`ctest -R e2e-helpers-selftest`,
# `scripts/check-e2e-helpers.sh`), for the reason `src/tests/ScriptedSocket.hpp`
# does: a shared helper is a shared fake, a fake nobody exercises does not report
# its own bugs, and getting this one wrong breaks every fixture at once. A helper
# library with no test that can go red is this ticket's own failure mode one level
# up.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# bash 3.2
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# macOS ships a 2007 `/bin/bash` and these fixtures run on every platform CI
# builds, so nothing here may use `mapfile`/`readarray`, `declare -A`,
# `${var^^}`, `local -n`, `[[ -v ]]`, or a fractional `read -t`. The self-test
# scans this file for those, because "we remembered" is not a check.
#
# `BASHPID` is in that list and is the interesting one; see `fail` below.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Caller contract
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A fixture sources this file and then calls `e2e_begin` once, at the top level:
#
#     source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib/e2e-common.sh"
#     workdir="$(mktemp -d)"
#     trap cleanup EXIT
#     e2e_begin "cluster E2E" "$workdir"
#
# `e2e_begin` after the EXIT trap, because it installs a TERM trap whose whole
# purpose is to let the EXIT trap run (see `fail`).
#
# And a fixture exports its OWN `FASTCACHE_*` settings AFTER sourcing this file,
# because sourcing it clears every one it inherited -- see
# `e2e_scrub_fastcache_environment` below.

# The text every failure message is prefixed with, so a suite log says which
# fixture stopped. Set by `e2e_begin`.
_e2e_label="e2e"

# Where the issued-port ledger lives. The fixture's own workdir, so the cleanup
# it already has takes the ledger away with everything else.
_e2e_workdir=""

# The pid of the shell that sourced this file. See `fail`.
_e2e_top_pid=$$

# A function name to run before a failure is reported, or empty. `cluster-e2e`
# uses it to dump every node's log: a consensus defect that reproduces
# intermittently is diagnosable from the logs or it is not diagnosable at all,
# and cleanup takes them away.
_e2e_on_fail=""

# The default bound for a wait, in seconds. Every wait takes an optional
# per-call override; this is what a fixture that has one budget sets once.
#
# 20 s is the historical default of four of the seven copies. It is deliberately
# NOT a number this file argues for: a bound is an assumption about the machine,
# and the machine differs per fixture. `fleet-dashboard-e2e` sets 240 because the
# node walks a compiler's include tree before it binds, and that is minutes on a
# cold runner. A fixture that has measured its own cost should say so where the
# measurement is, which is in the fixture.
_e2e_wait_seconds=20

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A fixture inherits no FASTCACHE_* setting
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The launcher, fastcached and the node read their whole configuration from
# FASTCACHE_* variables, so one this shell inherited decides what a fixture
# measures: an operator's FASTCACHE_SCHEDULER dispatches each "local" compile to
# their fleet, whose objects name a worker's scratch directory instead of the
# fixture's checkout, and FASTCACHE_VERIFY or FASTCACHE_NO_DIRECT changes the
# outcome a case asserts. A fixture sets what it means and inherits nothing.
#
# So SOURCING this file clears them, and every fixture gets that by construction.
# It was a loop in one fixture, and absent from the rest: `launcher-replay-e2e.sh`
# configured and built a whole project with whatever scheduler the shell carried,
# and its cold build then compiled on somebody's fleet. The one ordering rule is
# the caller contract's above -- a fixture's own exports come after the `source`.
#
# The exceptions are `E2eInheritedKnobs`: a variable the HARNESS reads, which no
# server and no launcher does, and which an operator sets on purpose. Clearing one
# would silently turn the knob off. A row here is a claim that nothing this project
# ships reads the name -- a launcher setting must never be added.
#
#   FASTCACHE_TSAN_TIMEOUT  `tsan-gate.sh`'s per-target bound, read after it
#                           sources this file.

# `exit` inside `( ... )` ends the subshell only, and a fixture that carries on
# then reports a SECOND failure about the artefacts the first one explains -- so
# a reader working upward from the last line starts on the wrong question. That
# has happened here (`launcher-replay-e2e`, its first run anywhere).
#
# The obvious guard is to compare `BASHPID` with the top-level pid and signal the
# parent only when they differ. `$$` cannot do it -- bash keeps `$$` at the
# parent's value inside a subshell, so that comparison always holds and the guard
# silently does nothing. But `BASHPID` was introduced in **bash 4.0**, and macOS
# ships 3.2, where it is unset: `[ "${BASHPID:-$$}" = "$top_pid" ]` is then
# `[ "$$" = "$top_pid" ]`, which always holds -- the same guard silently doing
# nothing, one level down, on the one platform the fixtures cannot be run on
# locally from here.
#
# So there is no detection. The signal is sent UNCONDITIONALLY and the local
# `exit 1` follows it. At the top level that is a self-signal caught by the TERM
# trap `e2e_begin` installed, which exits 1 and runs the EXIT trap; in a subshell
# the parent takes it and does the same while the subshell exits on its own. Both
# paths end at status 1 with cleanup run, and neither asks which shell it is in.
# Exercised in all three contexts -- top level, `( ... )`, and `$( ... )` -- by
# the self-test.

# spellings this file replaced -- and a fixture that wants the answer as a bool,
# because a closed port is an expected outcome there rather than a fault, calls
# the same thing the waits do.
#
# A connect probe, not a bind probe: bind-then-close leaves the port in TIME_WAIT
# on some systems, and a caller drawing a port is about to hand it to a
# *different* process anyway, so the only question this can honestly answer is
# "is anything answering here right now".

#
# Racy in principle, since `port_answers` above cannot reserve anything; these
# tests are RUN_SERIAL and the range is wide, and the alternative -- fixed ports
# -- races with every other smoke test in the suite rather than only with itself.
#
# Ports already handed out THIS RUN are remembered and skipped. Without that, the
# only question asked is "is anything listening", and nothing is listening on a
# port issued a moment ago whose server has not bound yet -- so two calls could
# return the same number and the second process to start died with
# `bind(...) failed: 98`. A fixture that draws every port it needs before binding
# any of them is exactly the window that makes it reachable: rare enough to read
# as an unrelated flake, and it did.
#
# The ledger is a FILE rather than a variable because every call site is a command
# substitution, and a subshell's assignment is gone the moment it exits -- which
# is how a first attempt at this fixed nothing at all.
#
# The range stops BELOW the kernel's ephemeral port range, which is the half a
# connect probe cannot cover. A port can be the local endpoint of an OUTBOUND
# connection -- ESTABLISHED or TIME_WAIT -- with nothing listening on it, so the
# probe says "free" and the `bind()` that follows still fails with EADDRINUSE.
# The ledger does not help either: that port was never issued by this fixture.
#
# CI caught exactly that: `bind(127.0.0.1:33174) failed: 98` for a daemon started
# after five cases' worth of launcher and probe connections had consumed ephemeral
# ports. 33174 is inside Linux's default `ip_local_port_range` of 32768-60999,
# which the old draw of 20000-39999 overlapped by its top 7232 numbers -- worse
# than one draw in three.
#
# 20000-31999 is below that floor and below macOS's 49152, and 12000 numbers is
# ample for a fixture that draws a dozen. A machine that lowered the sysctl below
# 32000 would need this to move with it, and
# `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range` is the check.
#
# The ledger is per RUN, so it says nothing about a process drawing beside this one
# from the same range: two of them can each draw a number the other is about to
# bind. `check-e2e-helpers.sh` runs its cases in lanes at once, and a case that
# needs a port NOBODY binds -- `node-ready-refuses-unbound` -- found another lane's
# listener on it (Linux arm64, round 6). So a caller that runs draws side by side
# hands each its own SLICE of the range in `E2E_PORT_RANGE` (`e2e_port_slice`).
# Draws from two slices cannot meet whatever the timing -- PROVIDED the caller numbers
# its slices across everything it runs at once: two tables of lanes each numbered from
# zero handed lane k of both one slice, which is how the first version of this left the
# collision in place.

# Who owns the listener?
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `port_answers` asks whether ANYTHING is listening. `wait_for_port` used to stop there,
# so *my process is up* and *somebody's process is up* were one answer and a fixture could
# run its whole body against a foreign listener and pass (#1321). Measured during #183 by
# planting a squatter on the fixture's port: the wait returned after ONE poll and the
# fixture then passed. The `pid` argument was already there and does not help -- it is
# used to notice the process DYING, which is only consulted on the failure path, so the
# port probe wins the race that matters.
#
# Per-run ports narrow this and do not close it. `free_port` draws below the ephemeral
# range and probes by CONNECTING, and this repository already records that a connect probe
# cannot see a port held as an outbound connection's local endpoint -- so a drawn port is
# not proven free -- and between the draw and the bind there is a window nothing re-checks.
# A rare silent wrong answer is worse than a common loud one: it surfaces as an
# unreproducible failure somewhere else entirely.
#
# ## FIVE answers, because three of them get folded
#
#   owned           the listener belongs to $pid or a DESCENDANT of it
#   foreign         it belongs to a process that is neither -- terminal, the wait fails
#   unattributable  this platform, or this privilege level, cannot answer
#   no-subject-pid  the caller passed `-`: there is no subject to attribute to
#   not-listening   nothing is listening this instant -- a TRANSIENT, not a verdict
#
# `unattributable` and `no-subject-pid` both end in "proceed on the port alone" and are
# still two states, because they are two different diagnoses: one is a missing tool and
# one is a fixture that never had a pid to offer (a launchd job under a service account).
# Folding them would print a platform complaint at a call site that is working correctly.
#
# `not-listening` is a transient rather than a verdict. The port answered and the owner
# lookup found nobody, which happens when a socket closes between the two questions; the
# wait keeps polling and the deadline still bounds it.
#
# ## It fails OPEN, deliberately
#
# A listener that exists and cannot be attributed is `unattributable`, never `foreign`.
# The failure directions are not symmetric: a missed squatter costs the wrong answer this
# was written to catch, while a wrong `foreign` REFUSES the subject's own listener and
# fails a healthy tree -- and nine fixtures call this, including the heaviest in the tree.
# Refusing looks like rigour, which is why this says so out loud.
#
# The residual, stated rather than implied: a squatter owned by ANOTHER USER is invisible
# to an unprivileged `ss`/`lsof`, so it lands in `unattributable` and is waved through
# with a warning. The realistic case -- a leftover from this user's own previous run --
# is attributable, and that is the one the port-reaper rule is about.
#
# ## Attribution accepts the pid OR ANY DESCENDANT
#
# A fixture starts a wrapper which starts the daemon, so the listener belongs to the
# grandchild. Matching the pid exactly would report `foreign` for the process the fixture
# launched itself, which is the wrong-`foreign` failure above arriving by the front door.

# Bound on the ancestry walk. A process table is a forest and cannot be 64 deep here; the
# guard exists because a walk that meets a cycle or a pid it cannot read would otherwise
# spin, and a bound nobody has watched fire is untested rather than proven -- the

#   macOS    `lsof`, which is in the base system.
#   MSYS     Windows `netstat -ano` reports WINDOWS pids while `$!` yields an MSYS pid.
#            They join through `ps`, which prints both columns. Measured on Windows 11
#            (2026-09-12): a listener backgrounded from Git Bash had MSYS pid 749567,
#            `ps` gave it WINPID 45220, and `netstat -ano` named 45220 as the LISTENING
#            owner. A prior reading of this recorded the two numberings as uncomparable;
#            they are not, and `ps` is the join. `ss`, `lsof` and `fuser` are all absent
#            there, so this row is the only one that can answer on that host.

# `ss -ltnH ... -p` prints `users:(("name",pid=NNN,fd=N))`, one socket per line and
# possibly several owners on one socket under SO_REUSEPORT.
# EVERY backend returns 0 for ANSWERED (possibly with nothing, which is `not-listening`)
# and 1 for COULD NOT ASK. That distinction is the whole of `unattributable`, and each
# backend has to make it for itself: a pipeline's status is its LAST command's, so a tool
# that failed at the head of one is invisible from the end of it.
#
# `ss`'s own status is captured BEFORE the parse, for exactly that reason: piped straight

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bounded waits
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every wait here is bounded, names what it waited for, records what it COST on
# success, and on expiry says which KIND of failure it was. Those are four
# separate obligations from `.agent/rules/testing.md` and the last two are the
# ones that get dropped:
#
#   * The cost, because nothing recorded it, so no budget in any fixture could be
#     set from data -- every number was a guess that survived by being generous.
#     A green run now measures itself.
#   * The kind, because a wait reporting only `waited 20s for the worker` cannot
#     tell a loaded machine from a wedged process, and those are fixed in
#     completely different places. Reading such a failure nobody can responsibly
#     choose between raising the budget and opening a defect, so the budget gets
#     raised -- that being the action that makes the red go away.
#
# A process that DIED is a third case and is reported the moment it is noticed
# rather than after the budget, because a timeout is not what happened.
#
# What is deliberately NOT here is a CPU-consumption signal. `node-scratch-\
# isolation-e2e` needs one because the step it waits on -- walking a compiler's
# include tree -- logs NOTHING while it runs, so a slow walk and a wedge produce
# identical logs and log growth alone diagnoses that case confidently and wrongly.
# The waits here are for a socket to bind and for named lines to appear, where log
# growth can be false in the failing case and is therefore evidence. Adding a CPU
# reading that cannot be calibrated portably -- `ps -o time=` is whole seconds on
# Linux, so a cold I/O-bound step reads as zero and would be called BLOCKED -- is
# how a signal that cannot be false in the failing case gets printed beside a
# conclusion and lends it authority it has not earned. `_e2e_verdict` is pure and
# takes a record, so a reading that CAN be calibrated is one argument away.

# How long a poll pauses before trying again. A PACING device, not the unit the
# bound is measured in -- see `wait_until`.
_e2e_poll_pause=0.2

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A deadline no clock can move, and the millisecond arithmetic that reports on it
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# #1066. Every bound in this file used to be `SECONDS`, and `SECONDS` is
# `CLOCK_REALTIME`. On a host whose wall clock steps -- this project's own
# development host does, measured -- a bound read from it is not a duration:
#
#   * a BACKWARD step LENGTHENS the bound. A wedged process is waited on past its
#     ceiling and the fixture reports a slow pass instead of a hang. This is the
#     direction observed here, and its SIZE varies: ~1.28 s, then ~1.43-1.45 s,
#     then ~1.57-1.68 s, across three sessions and three different instruments.
#     There is not even a constant to widen against.
#   * a FORWARD step SHORTENS it. A healthy client is killed early and the fixture
#     reports a failure that did not happen -- a red on a good tree.
#
# Neither is distinguishable from the thing the bound exists to detect, which is
# what makes this different from a bound that is merely too tight.
#
# ## The primitive, and why it is a FILE rather than `kill -0` on the timer
#
# `sleep` is `nanosleep`: it counts down a RELATIVE interval, so a wall-clock step
# cannot move it. Measured, on the run that motivated this: 20 x `sleep 0.2` took
# 4.03 s of monotonic time in a round whose realtime read 2.76 s. That makes a
# background `sleep` a sound deadline whatever the clock does.
#
# The obvious way to READ it is `kill -0 "$timerPid"`, which #1066 itself suggests.
# It is rejected, and on the half that ticket did not argue. `sleep` being
# step-proof is a property of `nanosleep` and is measured; whether `kill -0` still
# answers for a FINISHED timer is a property of whether this bash has REAPED it,
# and an unreaped child is a zombie, which answers `kill -0` with SUCCESS. That
# would be a deadline that never expires -- an unbounded wait inside the thing that
# exists to bound one, which is strictly worse than the defect being fixed.
#
# Measured on bash 5.2.21: reaped in 5 of 5, and again with no intervening `wait`.
# (An earlier draft of this said 5.3.9, which is the version this file's own older
# comments claimed for this host and which nothing on it reports: WSL's bash is
# 5.2.21 and Git Bash's is 5.2.37. A wrong version attached to a real measurement
# is the same defect as a figure with no conditions, and it propagated by being
# copied rather than asked.)
# NOT measured on bash 3.2, which macOS ships as `/bin/bash` and which
# `FASTCACHED_BASH` resolves to on every non-Windows platform -- so the one
# interpreter this file is most careful about is the one the reading cannot be
# checked on. A marker FILE has no such question on any bash: the timer creates it
# or it does not, and `[ -e ]` is the whole reading.
#
# This is also the primitive #1048 shipped in this same file, in `_http_drain_fd3`
# -- 754 lines further down, which is a reason to say so here rather than to expect
# anyone to notice. One mechanism, one argument, one place to be wrong.
#
# ## It is NOT the watchdog `run_bounded` already rejected
#
# `_e2e_bounded_pauses`' header rejects `( sleep n; kill $pid ) &` because a pid may
# be REUSED after `wait` reaps it, so a watchdog that fires later can signal a
# stranger. That objection is about a timer that KILLS. This one touches a file and
# signals nothing; the loop that owns the pid does the killing, exactly as before.
# Stated here because the paragraph reads like a rejection of this design and is
# three hundred lines away from it.
#
# COST, and the figure is a PAIRED one because the unpaired ones were load. The
# same 20 commands read 285 ms, 830 ms and 1352 ms across a single session while
# nothing about them changed. Run against the unconverted version with the order
# alternated per round, and timed from `/proc/uptime` -- the guard's own meter is
# bash's `time`, which reads the steppable clock and produced a 0 ms reading in
# the same experiment -- the pairwise differences are within 80 ms and change
# sign, against a load-driven spread of 500-2100 ms for identical work. So: not
# measurably different, rather than faster or slower.

# Milliseconds for a `sleep` argument, without a fork and without floating point.
#
# Sets `_e2e_ms` rather than echoing it: this is called once per poll, and a
# command substitution is a fork -- which is the very cost `_e2e_bounded_pauses`
# exists to avoid, so paying it to MEASURE that cost would be self-defeating.
#
# `10#` forces base ten. Without it `0.05` yields the fraction `050`, which bash
# reads as OCTAL, and `0.08` would then be a syntax error rather than 80 -- a
# ramp value away from breaking every bound in this file.
#
# Anything below a millisecond TRUNCATES to zero, which is a floor rather than a
# rounding error: the figure this feeds is compared against half a bound to say
# whether the HOST was slow, so under-counting biases that reading toward "the
# host was slow", which is the direction that sends a reader to look at the
# machine rather than at their own code. Every pause here is 10 ms or more.

# Arm a deadline.
#
# `mktemp` CREATES the marker and the arm removes it, so the name is unique by the
# OPERATING SYSTEM and the file's existence afterwards is this timer's statement and
# nothing else's. That matters because every other way of spelling a unique name here
# fails on the one interpreter this file is most careful about.
#
# `$$` is NOT unique: bash keeps it at the PARENT's value inside `( ... )`, which is
# the same fact that makes `BASHPID` unusable on bash 3.2, and this file's callers run
# `run_bounded` inside command substitutions -- `cluster-e2e`'s probe loop does it 261
# times in one wait. A sequence number does not rescue it, because a subshell inherits
# the counter and advances its own copy: measured, two command substitutions calling
# one `draw` function both answered `1695426.1`. `$RANDOM` does not rescue it either,
# and that one is a VERSION-DEPENDENT trap -- bash 5.0+ reseeds it in a subshell and
# 3.2 does not, so three separate `$( )` gave `15789`, `1266`, `28734` here and would
# give one value three times on macOS.
#
# AN EARLIER VERSION BUILT THE NAME BY PARAMETER EXPANSION TO AVOID THE FORK, and the
# measurement it cited for that was wrong. It claimed `mktemp` cost 830 ms across the
# 20 calls `run_bounded`'s fast-path guard times. Paired against the fork-free form,
# order-alternated and timed from `/proc/uptime` rather than from the guard's own
# steppable meter, the real difference is **about 50 ms across 20 calls** -- 2.5 ms
# each, against a ceiling of 2000 ms that the guard currently meets at about 390 ms.
# The 830 ms was unpaired, taken at a different load, and taken while a separate
# defect was still in the loop. A robustness property was dropped on a number that
# could not support the decision, and the number felt sufficient because it was large.
#
# What the fork-free form left behind was a safety property that lived in its CALLERS
# rather than in this function: a colliding name is harmless only while every caller
# retires its timer with an uncatchable signal before arming the next, so no stale
# timer is ever alive to write a marker a later wait is watching. That held, and it is
# not a property anything checks. The failure it would eventually produce is a false
# POSITIVE -- a bound that appears to fire correctly while reporting a previous
# probe's answer -- which is the one direction nothing else in this file guards.
#
# A FAILED arm is refused rather than returned, for #709's reason one level up:
# absence of the marker is read as "the deadline has not passed", so an unusable
# workdir -- removed, full, permissions changed -- would present as a bound that
# never expires. The state that cannot happen must not look like the state that has
# not happened yet.
#
# The background job's stdout and stderr are redirected. It inherits this shell's
# otherwise, and `run_bounded`'s stdout is the bounded command's output -- so a
# timer that outlives a disarm would hold that pipe open and a reader would wait
# for EOF it is not going to get until the deadline expires. The first version of
# this WAS wrapped in a command substitution, where the same redirect was load
# bearing for a sharper reason: `$( )` reads until every holder of the pipe closes
# it, so a 240 s deadline took 240 s to arm.
#
# It SETS `_e2e_deadline_armed` rather than echoing, because a command substitution
# is a fork and this is armed once per `run_bounded` call: measured, echoing cost
# about 200 ms across the 20 calls that function's own fast-path guard times, on a
# 2000 ms ceiling another ticket is defending. The global is copied into a local by
# the caller on the very next line, and a caller that arms twice without copying
# gets the second answer twice -- which is why every call site here is arm-then-copy
# and nothing holds this variable across a call.

    # TWO GUARDS, FOR TWO WINDOWS, and only the second one is load bearing:

    #   * `trap -` covers a subshell that has STARTED. It is first, so nothing else
    #     can run before it.
    #   * `kill -KILL` in `_e2e_deadline_disarm` covers the window BEFORE that, which
    #     is the one that fires: the disarm follows the arm within microseconds on a
    #     wait that returns at once, so the subshell is usually signalled before it
    #     has run a single command, and an inherited `trap 'exit 1' TERM` then takes
    #     it straight to the inherited EXIT trap. `trap -` cannot help there because
    #     it has not run yet.
    #
    # Measured rather than argued, and the argument came second: `trap -` ALONE was
    # A/B'd against the unfixed version, interleaved and order-alternated at load 47,
    # and came back 10 pass / 2 fail against 9 pass / 3 fail -- indistinguishable, so
    # the tempting fix does nothing on its own. The same harness at load 43 gives
    # 12 pass / 0 fail with the uncatchable signal against 7 pass / 5 fail without it.
    #
    # An earlier standalone probe of `( ... ) &` under a `trap cleanup EXIT` failed to
    # reproduce any of this -- twice, the first time because the subshell's output was
    # redirected to /dev/null, which is where its evidence went. A fake more permissive
    # than the thing it stands for; the real fixture found in one run what two probes
    # could not.
    # `3>&-` for the reason `_http_drain_fd3` gives at length: a forked timer inherits
    # the caller's descriptors, and an orphaned `sleep` then holds whatever socket the
    # caller had open for the rest of its interval. No caller of THIS arm holds one
    # today -- `wait_until` and `run_bounded` open no fd 3 -- so this is a guard

    # overshot by at most the last poll. What it could never see is the case this one
    # is for. A host taking two seconds over every `sleep 0.2` inside a 20 s budget
    # overshoots the last poll by two seconds and fires nothing, while asking for about
    # 2 s of pauses where 20 s were intended -- a tenfold signal the old reading had no
    # access to. It is also the discriminator #1066 asks for at `run_bounded`, and this

# The general bounded wait, and the body both `wait_for_port` and `wait_for_log`
# are. One loop, because those two differ only in what they test each pass, and
# two loops is two chances for the liveness check, the cost accounting and the
# verdict to drift apart -- which is how six copies of `wait_for_port` came to
# have three different failure semantics.
#
# PUBLIC, because a fixture waiting on something neither of those covers is the
# case that hand-rolls a loop and reintroduces every defect this file exists to
# remove. `fleet-dashboard-e2e` had exactly that -- a poll for a worker to appear
# in `/fleet.json`, with its own bound, its own message and no liveness check --
# so a bespoke CONDITION is a predicate passed to this, never a bespoke loop.
#
# THE BOUND COMES FROM A CLOCK, NOT FROM AN ITERATION COUNT. Every copy this
# replaces counted iterations and called the product a duration -- "100 x 0.2s =
# 20s", "2400 x 0.1s = 240s" -- and none of those equalities holds. `sleep` is an
# external command, so each pass forks and execs it, and `sleep 0.2` itself
# overshoots on a busy machine: the product is a LOWER bound that drifts most
# exactly when a fixture is timing out, which is when somebody is reading it.
#
# `fleet-dashboard-e2e` had the defect in its purest form:
#
#     fail "timed out after $((WAIT_TICKS / 10))s waiting for $what ..."
#
# a duration computed from the loop shape and never observed. Whatever the loop
# actually took, the operator was told `WAIT_TICKS / 10`. And `testing.md`
# requires that message to separate a slow machine from a wedged process -- which
# the one reading that would show a slow machine cannot do when it is derived
# from the assumption that the machine was fast.
#
# So the reported duration is MEASURED rather than assumed, and `SECONDS` is what
# measures it: a bash builtin, so it costs no fork, in bash 3.2, one-second
# resolution, which is ample against budgets of 20 s and 240 s. `sleep` stays, as
# pacing.
#
# **`SECONDS` no longer BOUNDS the loop, and that half of this paragraph was wrong
# for a reason it could not state (#1066).** It is `CLOCK_REALTIME`, so on a host
# that steps its wall clock a bound taken from it is not a duration at all: a
# backward step lengthens the wait past its ceiling and a forward one cuts it
# short, and neither is distinguishable from the thing the bound exists to detect.
# The bound is `_e2e_deadline_arm` -- a background `sleep`, which counts down a
# relative interval and cannot be moved by either.
#
# The two halves are independent and both still hold. The original argument was
# against a bound counted in ITERATIONS, which reports a duration nobody observed;
# that is still right, and the deadline is still a duration rather than a count.
# What it did not consider is that a clock can be a fiction too.
#
# A PID PASSED HERE MUST BE ONE THIS USER CAN SIGNAL. Liveness is `kill -0`, and
# `kill -0` answers non-zero for a process that is alive but owned by somebody
# else -- EPERM and ESRCH are the same reading from a shell. This loop treats
# non-zero as DIED, so a pid running under a service account would be reported
# as having died, on the first poll, with an exit status of `-` and its log
# dumped: a confident wrong answer of exactly the kind the verdict exists to
# avoid, and one no bound or budget would soften.
#
# Measured rather than reasoned: `kill -0 1` as an ordinary user answers
# `Operation not permitted` and returns non-zero, and pid 1 is not dead.
#
# So the rule is "a pid this shell may signal, or `-`", and `-` is not a lesser
# answer -- the verdict reports it as its own outcome, which is honest, where a
# borrowed pid is simply wrong. `macos-package-e2e` is the live case: its
# LaunchDaemon runs as `_fastcached`, so it passes `-`, while
# `macos-service-e2e`'s agent runs as the test user and is `kill -0`-ed by the
# fixture itself three lines earlier, so it passes the pid.
#
# @param 1 a function name; returns 0 when the wait is over
# @param 2 what is being waited for, for the messages
# @param 3 pid to watch, or "-" for none. Must be signallable by this user; see
#          above -- a pid owned by another account reads as DEAD.
# @param 4 log to watch and dump, or "-" for none
# @param 5 bound in seconds
# @param 6 optional pre-armed deadline, as `_e2e_deadline_arm` returns it. Given
#          one, this wait SHARES it and does not retire it -- which is how a
#          caller spends ONE budget across two waits without subtracting two clock
#          readings to split it. Absent, this wait arms and retires its own.
# @param 7 optional function name printing SUBJECT-specific findings when the wait
#          ends badly, or "". See below.
#
# WHY THERE IS A FINDINGS HOOK AT ALL, since one more parameter on the general
# wait wants justifying. `_e2e_verdict` answers one question -- was this a slow
# machine, a wedged process or a dead one -- and it answers it from readings every
# wait takes. Some waits can say something MORE, and it is a different fact about
# a different subject: a counter wait knows whether anything answered a scrape,
# whether the series exists at all, and what the last reading was, and those three
# are three terminal states that must not collapse into "timed out" (#643).
#
# The alternative spellings were both worse. `e2e_on_fail` is a FIXTURE-wide hook
# -- `cluster-e2e` dumps every node's log through it -- so a wait that claimed it
# would silently displace whatever the fixture had installed, and it fires for
# every `fail` rather than for this one. A bespoke loop beside `wait_until` is how
# six copies of `wait_for_port` came to have three different failure semantics.
#
# The hook takes no arguments and reads what it needs from its caller's locals by
# dynamic scope, exactly as `_e2e_wait_retire_deadline` does. It runs AFTER the
# verdict and BEFORE the log dump, on stderr, on every bad exit -- expiry and
# death alike, because a process that died with its counter at 3 is a fact worth
# printing beside the death.

# Wait for a line to appear in a log, the way `wait_for_port` waits for a listener.
#
# A bound port does NOT mean a process has finished announcing itself. A tier
# binds its listener and logs what it bound *afterwards*, because the message
# names the endpoint and the endpoint is not known until the bind returns. So a
# `grep` run straight after `wait_for_port` is a race -- and one that widens
# exactly where it is least welcome: under a sanitizer, or with the log on a slow
# filesystem, the gap between the two stops being instant.
#
# WHAT THE MARKER MUST BE. A wait waits on what a line MEANS, not on its wording,
# and the two come apart without anything being renamed. `compile node ready` meant
# *surveyed* until #365 made a node bind first and survey afterwards; the line was
# not renamed, not moved and not reworded, it simply stopped carrying the fact a
# fixture was reading out of it, and three include-tree walks that had been
# serialised began running at once. And a marker can be too LOOSE from the start:
# the bare word `registered` also matches `0 of 1 toolchain(s) registered`, which
# is logged after every heartbeat round whatever the outcome, so three waits
# returned for a worker that had been turned away (#449). Match the fact, not the

# Wait until a node's heartbeat round was ACCEPTED by its scheduler.
#
# THE wait #449 is about, and it is here rather than in a fixture for the reason
# the divergence happened at all. `dist-compile-e2e.sh` matched the bare word
# `registered` at three sites; the summary line is logged after every heartbeat
# round whatever the outcome, so `0 of 1 toolchain(s) registered` matches it too
# and those waits returned for a worker the scheduler had TURNED AWAY. The
# fixture then proceeded against a fleet it believed was formed, nothing failed,
# and the property under test was simply not being tested.
#
# Correcting that in one fixture and leaving the other copies alone would fix the
# instance and reproduce the cause, so the corrected wait lives here and there is
# one of it.
#
# WHY THE COUNT IS LITERAL rather than a parameter. `1 of 1` is
# accepted-of-served, and the fact being waited on is "the scheduler took
# everything this node offered". Every node these fixtures start serves exactly
# one toolchain, so the accepted form is `1 of 1`. A fixture that some day starts
# a node serving two grows a parameter here -- and the parameter is then the
# ACCEPTED count, never the served one and never zero, because a marker naming
# zero accepted toolchains is the defect above wearing a parameter.

# The line a compile node logs once it is SERVING, and the marker
# `wait_for_node_ready` below waits on.
#
# A named constant, but NOT for the reason `E2eRegisteredMarker` above gives, and
# the difference is worth stating because the shapes are otherwise identical.
# That constant's self-test stages TWO texts -- `1 of 1` against `0 of 1` -- so
# naming it catches a wait that matched the wrong line. This one's self-test
# stages ONE text, present against absent, which catches a wait that does not
# wait; a second spelling of the text would not weaken that pair.
#
# What the constant buys HERE is that a rename has more than one reader. The
# self-test asserts through it (`node-ready-waits-for-marker`) and against the
# expiry message `wait_for_log` BUILDS from it (`node-ready-refuses-bound-only`'s
# required `to log: ...` text), so changing this line's wording fails the suite
# instead of quietly leaving three fixtures waiting for a string nothing logs.
#
# `_selftest_node` spells the text literally on purpose and is not a third
# reader: it is STAGING what a real node writes, the way `registration-accepted`
# stages its line. Staging the product's output and asserting the helper's
# behaviour are different jobs.
E2eNodeReadyMarker="compile node ready"

# The line `fastcached` logs once every acceptor is armed, and the marker

#
# The second row of `Core/ReadinessMarker.hpp`, and the two constants here are that

# recompiles no fixture, so rewording either breaks its waiters by TIMEOUT -- the
# slowest and least informative failure there is -- with a green build behind it.
#
# `ready, accepting connections` reports ACCEPTING, which is strictly later than the
# bind (#646). That is why a daemon gets a readiness wait rather than the port wait
# five call sites used: a bound port with nobody accepting answers a connect probe
# out of the backlog and then holds the client.
E2eDaemonReadyMarker="ready, accepting connections"

# Wait until a compile node is SERVING, not merely bound.
#
# BOUND IS NOT READY. Since #365 a node binds FIRST and logs this line
# afterwards, so `wait_for_port` returning has been strictly weaker than "the
# node is ready" ever since, and every assertion placed straight after one has
# been resting on the gap being small rather than on the property it needs.
#
# What kept that safe was an ACCIDENT, and #449 removed it without anything being
# able to notice. The old per-fixture helper opened `for _ in $(seq 1 100)` and
# probed before the node had bound, so its first probe always failed and it
# always slept 200 ms. `wait_until` does its setup before probing and does not
# oversleep: on a run where the port answers on the FIRST probe it proceeds with
# no sleep at all, and the assertion then runs inside the window. Measured on the
# `cluster-e2e` n4 shape, that window is single-digit milliseconds -- ample, since
# what has to fit inside it is a shell reaching its next statement.
#
# So this is TWO waits and not one, and they stay two on purpose: a stall before
# the bind and a stall between the bind and readiness are different faults, and
# `wait_until` names the predicate that expired, so the two remain two verdicts.
#
# WHAT THE SECOND WAIT BUYS, concretely. Between the bind and this line the node
# starts the reactor thread that ACCEPTS on the ports it has already bound -- its
# own comment reads "a client that dials the instant a port is bound must not
# find a listener nobody is accepting on" -- brings up its registrars and its
# heartbeat, and installs its stop handlers. A fixture that signals a node inside
# that window is signalling one that has not installed a handler yet, which is
# what #451 found; a fixture that dials one is dialling a listener nobody is
# accepting on.
#
# Registration is deliberately NOT here. Some nodes are started to hold a port and
# a cache tier and never join a fleet, so that stays `wait_for_registration` at the
# call sites that want it.
#
# THE BOUND IS THE TOTAL, and it is split rather than handed to each wait.
#
# Passing it to both is the obvious spelling and it means a stated N enforces up
# to 2N -- the declared number not being the quantity enforced, which is a defect
# this repository has already had and already fixed once: `cluster-e2e.sh`'s
# `enclosing_deadline` exists because a 30 s replication loop could call a 60 s
# `find_leader` twice, "reintroduced by composition rather than by arithmetic".
# Composing two bounded waits reintroduces it the same way.
#
# It is not academic here. `fleet-dashboard-e2e` runs with a 240 s ambient budget
# under a 600 s ctest timeout: at 2x, a node that binds and never becomes ready
# burns 480 s, and if ctest fires first the fixture is KILLED -- losing the
# verdict and the log dump, which is the entire point of the bounded wait. A test
# that hangs reports less than a test that fails.
#
# ONE DEADLINE, SHARED, rather than a budget split by subtracting two clock
# readings (#1066). The old spelling was `remaining = seconds - (SECONDS - started)`,
# and it fails in both directions on a host whose wall clock steps: a BACKWARD step
# makes `remaining` too large, so the stated total silently overruns, and a FORWARD
# one makes it too small -- floored at one second, which then expires without ever
# testing the predicate and reports a readiness failure for a node nobody had asked
# about readiness yet.
#
# That floor was the old code's guard against the same wrong answer arriving by a
# different route (a bind that consumed the whole budget), and the shared deadline
# removes the need for it entirely: there is no remainder to compute, so there is
# nothing to floor. The budget is spent by whichever leg is running, which is what
# "for BOTH waits together" meant in the first place.

# The counter wait
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Pull one counter out of a Prometheus body.
#
# THE GRAMMAR LIVES HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. It was written out at three call sites
# inside `dist-compile-e2e.sh` before that fixture grew a function for it, and the
# day the exporter grows a label or renders `1` as `1.0`, a copy that still
# matches nothing does not say "the series changed shape" -- it says "the counter
# did not move", which is a statement about the SUBJECT rather than about the
# instrument.
#
# It is in the library rather than in that fixture because `wait_for_counter`
# below needs it, and a second grammar inside the library would be the same defect
# one level down: the wait's "the series is absent" and the fixture's direct reads
# would then disagree about what absent MEANS, silently, in the run where it
# matters (#643).
#
# NOTHING ON STDOUT MEANS THE SERIES WAS ABSENT, which is a different fact from a
# reading of zero and must not be folded into one: a counter is a tally, so zero
# is the truth about events that never happened, while an absent series is a
# counter nothing exports. Every caller checks for the empty string separately.
#
# The body is a whole HTTP response, headers included, because that is what
# `http_get` echoes; the expression is anchored at the start of a line, so no
# header can match it.

# Read one counter off an admin endpoint: one scrape, one series.
#
# The two outcomes are told apart by the STATUS and not by the output, and both
# callers depend on it: a non-zero return is "nothing answered the request at
# all", an empty echo with status zero is "it answered and the series is not
# there". Folding those two into an empty string is what makes a wait unable to
# say which of its three terminal states it reached.
#
# A caller that wants several series from ONE instant does not use this: it takes
# a body with `http_get` and reads it with `metric_value` as many times as it
# likes, because three requests are three different instants and comparing series
# taken a round trip apart asserts something nobody meant.
#
# **It returns `http_get`'s status UNCHANGED**, and that is #1257 reaching its own
# callers. Folding every non-zero into 1 would restate the sentence above -- *nothing
# answered the request at all* -- about a response our own bound CUT SHORT, which is

# Which of the three ways a counter wait can end badly this one was.
#
# PURE: it reads no clock, opens no socket and touches no process. Everything it

# a decision worth several named outcomes is worth separating from the ambient
# facts it reads, and each branch then costs one staged row rather than a stand-in
# that has to be arranged to exhibit it.
#
# THREE STATES, and the whole of #643 is that they must not collapse:
#
#   * nothing ever answered a scrape -- the admin surface is down, or the port is
#     wrong. Nothing observed here is a statement about the counter at all.
#   * it answered and the series is ABSENT -- the process exports no such counter.
#     A worker with no cache tier exports no cache series, so this is an ordinary
#     answer as well as a possible defect, and it is never a reading of zero.
#   * the series is present and never reached the floor -- and then the LAST
#     READING is the finding, because "it sat at 0" and "it reached 2 of 3" send a
#     reader to different places.

# `started_pid` for a neighbouring reason and records it at length: a function
# called in a command substitution runs in a SUBSHELL, and that fixture's own

#
#   * IT DID NOT HONOUR `e2e_wait_seconds`. It opened `local seconds=10`, so an
#     operator raising the fixture's budget -- the documented remedy for a slow
#     box -- scaled every wait in the file except this one. And this is the wait a
#     slow machine lengthens MOST: it waits for a compile to finish and a counter
#     to rise, where the others wait for a process to bind.
#   * IT PRODUCED NO SLOW-VERSUS-WEDGED VERDICT, so its timeout could not say
#     which kind of failure it was -- the distinction `.agent/rules/testing.md`
#     requires of every wait, because a loaded machine and a wedged process are

#
# What it DID have is the reason it was not simply converted: three terminal

# How long any one read here may block before the probe gives up.
#
# Named once so the read and the code that INTERPRETS the read cannot disagree
# about it. A bound in one place and a threshold in another is two numbers that
# have to stay equal forever.
#
# IT IS ALSO COUPLED TO A NUMBER IN THE DAEMON, and nothing checks that. It must
# stay STRICTLY ABOVE `AdminHttpServer::RequestTimeout`
# (`src/Pace/Server/AdminHttpServer.hpp`, 2000 ms today), because
# `http_response_to_silence` reads a silent server's CLOSE as its answer: if the
# server's deadline ever reaches this bound, the probe returns
# `$E2eSilenceInconclusive` and `fleet-dashboard-e2e.sh` FAILS rather than skips.
# #828 proposes splitting that deadline and is exactly the change that would do it,
# so raise this number in the same commit -- the two files are a pair.
_e2e_http_read_bound=5

# The second read that tells a CLOSED peer from a HOLDING one where the exit status
# cannot (bash 3.2). Paid only on that interpreter and on a genuine close, never on the
# common held path under bash 4+, which arm 1 answers for free.
#
# The ordering the probe needs is `fast-return << marker-delay < probe-bound`, and the
# two margins are NOT alike, so both are stated rather than the comfortable one:
#
#   * BELOW the marker: a closed peer returns in microseconds against a 1 s marker, a
#     factor of about a thousand. Losing this needs the marker to fire inside a read
#     that came back at once, and it fails to "the peer is holding" -- a false PASS,
#     the silent direction. Nothing plausible closes a thousandfold gap.
#   * ABOVE the marker: the marker must appear before this bound expires, which is 1 s
#     against 4 s -- a factor of four, and the tight side. It is lost only if a
#     `sleep 1` plus one file creation is delayed past 4 s. This host was measured at
#     load 31 with three lanes gating and that did not happen, but load is not bounded
#     by anything here. When it IS lost, a HOLDING peer reads as closed: a false RED,
#     the loud direction, and the same symptom #1048 had -- now needing a three-second
#     scheduling stall rather than a 1.3 s clock step.
#
# So the failure mode was chosen rather than inherited: the tight margin fails the way
# somebody notices, and the wide margin guards the way nobody would.
#
# The marker sits at 1 s because it is the balance point. Shorter crowds the
# thousandfold side for no gain on the tight one; longer buys margin above and spends
# it below, where a fast close is only microseconds away.
#
# None of these margins has to absorb a clock step, and that is the design rather than
# luck: neither side of the comparison reads the wall clock. `read -t` and `sleep` both
# count down relative intervals, so a `CLOCK_REALTIME` step moves neither.
_e2e_http_probe_bound=4

# Must the sticky-EOF probe be taken, or has the STATUS already decided?
#
# Split out for the same reason `_e2e_read_ended_at_bound` below is: it was an
# inline condition inside `_http_drain_fd3` and it carried a second clause that
# was wrong.
#
# It read `[ "$status" -le 128 ] && [ -z "$body" ]` -- the probe only when the body
# was EMPTY. On bash 4+ that is invisible, because a timeout carries 142 and the
# status decides. On bash 3.2, which macOS ships as `/bin/bash`, a timeout and EOF
# BOTH carry 1, so a PARTIAL body reached `_e2e_read_ended_at_bound` as `(1, "-")`
# and was classified `peer` -- *the server answered* -- for a response our own
# bound had cut short (#1257).
#
# The body is NOT a reading about who ended the read. A closed peer answers the
# probe in microseconds because EOF is sticky, so taking it whenever the status
# cannot decide costs the healthy path nothing and only a HOLDING peer pays the
# bound.
#
# No version test, for the reason the drain gives in full: the arm is selected by
# what was OBSERVED, so 3.2 reaches it by construction rather than by this file
# asserting a version number about the interpreter running it.
#
# @param 1 the exit status of the read that ended the loop
# @return 0 the probe IS needed, 1 the status decided on its own

# Did the bound end that read, or did the peer?
#
# The verdict, split out as a pure function over a READING, for the reason
# `.agent/rules/testing.md` gives for `node-scratch-isolation-e2e`'s classifier: a
# decision that can only be reached by staging the real thing can only be tested
# where the real thing misbehaves. This one misbehaved on macOS ALONE -- bash 3.2
# is what breaks the status-based version -- so inlined in `http_response_to_silence`
# it is a property no Linux or Windows run can exercise, and the guard against it
# coming back is a CI leg that already went red once.
#
# Driven directly, every answer is one line on any platform, and it needs no listener,
# no port and no five-second wait.
#
# **It no longer reads the elapsed TIME, and that is #1048.** The old rule was
# `elapsed >= bound`, timed with `SECONDS` -- which is `CLOCK_REALTIME`, and this host
# steps it. Measured against `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`: a time-sync step of about -1.28 s,
# roughly 1 read in 14; and on this predicate's own case, 7 of 45 reads reported a
# `SECONDS` elapsed of 4 while the monotonic clock measured 5.01-5.06 s. Those reads
# had consumed their whole 5 s bound and carried status 142 to say so -- they only
# LOOKED short -- but `4 >= 5` was false, so a server that had held perfectly was
# reported as having CLOSED. 9 failures in 60 probes against one settled node, every
# body zero bytes, matching `fleet-dashboard-e2e`'s own 3-in-24. The reading was never
# a duration; `_http_drain_fd3` carries the mechanism.
#
# The two readings it takes instead are the ones that are not a race against a margin:
#
# @param 1 the exit status of the read that ended the loop. Above 128 is a timeout and
#          cannot be anything else -- measured disjoint from EOF's 1 on bash 5.2.21,
#          including the reads a stepped clock had made LOOK short. bash 3.2 answers 1
#          for both, which is why there is a second parameter at all.
# @param 2 whether the follow-up probe read BLOCKED: 1 it did, 0 it came back at once,
#          `-` no probe was taken (the peer had spoken, so nothing was ambiguous).
#          Judged against a background `sleep`, never a clock. EOF is sticky, so a
#          closed peer answers in microseconds and a holding one consumes its bound.

# Read one whole response off fd 3 and close it.
#
# The read half of every helper below, in ONE place. Called directly rather than
# through a command substitution, so its two output variables reach the caller: a
# subshell's variable does not.
#
# `read -t` with a whole number and not a fractional timeout, because bash 3.2
# rejects one. Every read is bounded because the endpoint closes the connection
# itself (`Connection: close`), so a healthy server ends the loop on its own -- and
# a WEDGED one, which is exactly the state these probes exist to detect, would
# otherwise hang the suite instead of failing it.
#
# THE LAST CHUNK. `read` sets its variable and returns non-zero on a final chunk
# with no trailing newline, so a naive loop drops it. That is not a corner case
# here: the fleet dashboard's JSON document is ONE line with no newline at all, so
# without the line below the whole body vanishes and every assertion about it
# fails for a reason that has nothing to do with the server. One of the seven
# copies this file replaced learnt that; the other six never did -- which is the
# whole argument for there being one copy now rather than one per helper.
#
# ## What ended the read, and why NOT the elapsed time
#
# "The peer closed" and "our own bound expired" are different facts, and this file
# used to tell them apart by TIMING the read against `SECONDS`: one that consumed its
# whole bound was the bound's, anything shorter was the peer's. That is #1048.
#
# The argument it rested on was stated here at length, and its algebra is correct:
# `floor(a + BOUND) - floor(a)` really is exactly `BOUND`, and 200k simulated
# placements really did confirm it. **What it never states is the premise it needs:
# that the clock does not move.** On a host whose wall clock steps, the algebra is
# still true and the conclusion is still false, because `a` and `a + BOUND` are no
# longer readings of the same timeline.
#
# `SECONDS` is `CLOCK_REALTIME`. Measured against `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` on a WSL2 host: a
# host time-sync step of about **-1.28 s**, roughly 1 read in 14. Measured directly on
# this predicate's own case, 7 of 45 reads reported a `SECONDS` elapsed of 4 while the
# monotonic clock measured 5.01-5.06 s. The reads consumed their whole bound. They
# only looked short.
#
# So a 5 s bound "measured" 3.7 s, `4 >= 5` was false, and a server that had held
# perfectly was reported as having CLOSED -- 9 failures in 60 probes against one
# settled node, every one with a ZERO-byte body, so the server had said nothing at
# all. The reads all carried status 142, a genuine full-bound timeout, which is the
# confirmation: nothing returned early, the clock moved underneath the measurement.
#
# A wider tolerance is not the fix. The step size is a property of the host's time
# sync, not of this code, and nothing bounds it.
#
# ## The two readings that replace it, and what each depends on
#
# **Arm 1, the exit status.** A timeout is above 128; EOF is 1. Measured on bash
# 5.2.21: EOF carried 1 in 5 of 5, a timeout carried 142 in 40 of 40, including every
# read a stepped clock had made look short. **Depends on no clock at all**, which is
# why it is first.
#
# **Arm 2, a follow-up probe**, because arm 1 is unavailable where this has done its
# damage: bash 3.2 answers a plain `1` for both, macOS runs `/bin/bash`, and macOS is
# where #1048 and #1058 each ejected a pull request from the merge queue within an
# hour. Arm 2 is the load-bearing path, not a fallback.
#
# EOF is STICKY -- a closed peer leaves the fd readable forever -- so a second read
# returns at once where a holding peer consumes its whole bound. That is the signal;
# the difficulty is reading it on an interpreter with no monotonic clock.
#
# **It is NOT read from `SECONDS`.** Doing that would put the verdict back on the
# clock that caused this ticket, in the arm that runs where the ticket hurt. Instead a
# background `sleep 1` creates a marker file: `sleep` counts down a RELATIVE interval,
# so a wall-clock step cannot move it. If the marker exists when the read returns, the
# read blocked for about a second or more and the peer is holding; if not, the read
# came back at once and the peer had closed.
#
# The separation is a closed peer's microseconds against a held peer's whole
# `_e2e_http_probe_bound`, with the one-second marker between them, and neither side
# of that comparison consults the wall clock.
#
# No version test. The arms are selected by what was OBSERVED -- a status above 128,
# or its absence -- so 3.2 falls to arm 2 by construction rather than by this file
# asserting a version number about the interpreter running it. After #1048 that
# distinction is the point: the old rule failed because it asserted a property of the
# environment instead of reading one.
#
# What is NOT established: bash 3.2's own behaviour. There was no 3.2 to measure on,
# and the claim that it answers 1 for both is this file's own and remains untested.
# Arm 2 is built not to care either way, which is why it consults no status.
#
# It probes the LAST read rather than the loop, because a server that dribbles a line
# every two seconds would otherwise accumulate past the bound and be called a timeout.
#
# `_http_drain_elapsed` is still set, and it is an OBSERVATION rather than a verdict.
# It is a `SECONDS` difference, so on a stepping host it is not a duration; do not
# reintroduce it into any decision.
#
# @return echoes the body, and sets `_http_drain_ended` to `bound` when our own

# What an HTTP surface says, unprompted, to a peer that says NOTHING.
#
# Connect and read; never send. That is an unused browser preconnect exactly, and
# it is the DETERMINISTIC form of the #824 guard. The shape a report describes --
# connect, wait, then ask -- cannot be asserted on: once the server has answered
# and closed, the client's late write draws an RST, and the RST discards the
# client's receive buffer before the response in it can be read. Measured both
# ways against one unfixed binary: a `python` client saw the `400`, a bash client
# saw nothing. A guard built on that passes on the bug about half the time.
#
# No idle parameter. `_e2e_http_read_bound` outlasts any request deadline this tree
# sets, so a server that means to answer a silent peer has answered by the time the
# bound expires and one that means to close has closed. Sleeping first would only
# make the case slower.
#
# It REFUSES rather than answering when that bound is what ended the read: an
# expired `read -t` yields an empty body, which is byte-identical to "the server
# volunteered nothing" -- so without this the probe would go vacuous, silently,
# the day anyone raises the server's deadline past five seconds.
#
# **Three outcomes, three statuses, and the statuses are NAMED.** "The connection
# was refused" and "the bound expired" are different facts about different machines,
# and folding them into one non-zero is the same mistake one layer up as the `bool
# ok` this whole change is about: the caller then prints a diagnosis it has not
# established -- a dead node reported as a surface that would not answer.
#
# The names exist for the reason `E2eBoundOutcomeExceeded` below gives, and this
# function is the case that argument was written about. A bare literal FAILS OPEN:
# writing `1)` where `2)` was meant makes a fixture print "the node is gone" for
# "the surface would not answer" -- the exact mis-bucketing the three statuses exist
# to prevent, and no shell setting catches it. Compared against a name instead, a

# terminator.
#
# The exit status is the ONLY channel that survives, and that is why this is the

# A string comparison against a literal FAILS OPEN. `"exceed"` matches nothing,
# falls through whatever the caller does for `finished`, and reads as a probe
# that completed -- in `tsan-gate.sh`, whose entire subject is refusing to
# conclude "fine" from "I could not tell". Compared against a name instead,
# `$E2eBoundExceded` is an unbound variable and every caller here runs under
# `set -u`, so the same typo stops the run and says where.
#
# The VALUES are unchanged, deliberately: a caller still comparing to a literal
# keeps working, so this can be adopted per caller rather than in one sweep.

# Which of THREE things happened in the last `run_bounded`: `finished`,
# `exceeded`, or `unstartable`. Read with `e2e_bound_outcome`, never as a
# variable. Unambiguous where the status cannot be, because each is recorded from
# something observed rather than inferred from a number that means several
# things.
#
# **A FILE, and the first version of this was a shell variable that could not
# work.** Its comment claimed `cluster` "calls both inside one `$( ... )`, so the
# subshell that sets it is the subshell that reads it". That is false and the
# fixture proved it: `cluster` runs in one subshell, and `out="$(run_bounded …)"`
# opens ANOTHER inside it, so the assignment was discarded at the closing paren
# and every unstartable probe read back as `finished`. Verified end to end --
# 870 probes filed as `declined`, `0 NEVER STARTED`, against a client that did
# not exist.
#
# That is the defect this file's own `probe_log` comment was written about, in
# the helper written to fix it, with the wrong claim spelled out beside it. The
# self-test did not catch it because it called `run_bounded` directly while the
# only real caller captures its output -- a test exercising the helper
# differently from production is a test of something else.
#
# `unstartable` is the one that had to be measured. A command that cannot be
# executed exits **127 on Linux and 1 on macOS** -- observed, on this repository's
# own CI, in the commit that introduced this function. A caller matching 126/127
# therefore files it as an ordinary refusal on macOS, which is #457's defect for
# the third time: a state that cannot be reported gets reported as its neighbour,
# and the platform it breaks on is the one nobody here can run.
#
# And 127 is doubly ambiguous even on Linux -- `wait` answers 127 for a pid it
# cannot speak for, which `wait_until` above already records. So this is not
# inferred at all: `run_bounded` checks that the command is executable BEFORE
# spawning it.
#
# Per RUN and not per shell, so a caller must read it before its next
# `run_bounded` -- the same discipline `$?` already imposes. These fixtures probe
# sequentially; two concurrent `run_bounded`s would race for it, exactly as they
# would for `probe_log`.
_e2e_bound_outcome_path() { printf '%s' "${_e2e_workdir}/.bounded-outcome"; }

# What the last `run_bounded` did: finished | exceeded | unstartable.
#
# This is the ONE helper built to keep those three apart, and it used to have a
# fourth state it silently mapped onto the happiest of the three: `cat` failing was
# swallowed by `2>/dev/null || true`, so a record that was never written or could
# not be read came back `finished`. A canary that hung and was killed, in a run
# where the outcome file could not be written, read as a completed run (#709).
#
# The four states are now separated rather than a fourth being added to the
# vocabulary, which would change the contract every consumer already depends on:
#
#   * absent          -- nothing was bounded. `run_bounded` writes the record as its
#                        FIRST act and refuses if that write fails, so absence can
#                        only mean it was never called. That is what a caller which
#                        bounded nothing should read, and it stays `finished`.
#   * present, sound  -- the recorded word.
#   * present, unreadable or empty  -- the instrument cannot answer, so it REFUSES.
#   * present, unrecognised         -- likewise. A truncated write is not a verdict.
#
# Refusing rather than inventing a value is how this repository handles "the
# instrument could not answer" everywhere else, and it keeps the three-word

# Why this is bash and not `timeout(1)`
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Because `timeout(1)` IS NOT ON macOS, and reaching for it cost this repository
# a red CI leg with a confident wrong diagnosis attached (#457's own first fix).
# `cluster-e2e.sh` bounded its probe with a bare `timeout`; on macOS every probe
# was instead bash reporting `command not found`, which is a status of 127 --
# not 124, so it was not read as a bound expiring, and not the cluster's own
# words, so it matched none of the patterns the caller tested for. The fixture
# then reported "no node ever named a leader" about a cluster whose own dumped
# logs showed a leader elected in term 1 with both followers naming it.
#
# The obvious repair is to look for `timeout` and then `gtimeout`, which
# `scripts/tsan-gate.sh` used to do and which this file deliberately does NOT do.
# Measured rather than assumed: GitHub's `macos-14` image ships **neither** --
# `gtimeout` comes from Homebrew's `coreutils`, which is not in that image, and
# `tsan-gate.sh`'s macOS branch had never executed anywhere because the
# `clang-tsan` job is `runs-on: ubuntu-24.04`. (That resolver is gone as of #488;
# the gate calls `run_bounded` and the scan below no longer exempts it. The
# measurement above is this comment's own and stays here -- it is what #488 cites
# rather than restates.) So a resolver that refuses when it
# finds nothing would refuse on exactly the platform this was written for, and
# one that falls back to running unbounded would restore the unbounded probe
# while looking like it had a bound.
#
# A bound implemented here needs no binary, is the same bound on every platform
# CI builds, and can be shown expiring on a developer's machine. That removes the
# failure mode rather than detecting it, so there is no fourth state to report
# and no platform to refuse.
#
# This function is therefore also the CHECK, in #469's sense: with a bounded run
# in the shared library there is no reason for a fixture to spell `timeout`
# again, and `check-e2e-helpers.sh` scans for one that does. A paragraph in
# `tsan-gate.sh` did not travel to the next script that needed it, and a fourth
# private copy is how the three `ScriptedSocket` copies each carried the same
# defect. That paragraph was originally described here as CORRECT; #488 measured
# it and it was not -- it claimed the `clang-tsan` preset runs on macOS, which it
# does not, so the fallback it justified had never executed anywhere. Worth
# keeping in view, because it makes the case stronger rather than weaker: what
# failed to travel was not a fact but a plausible sentence, and a scan cannot
# tell those apart either, which is why the remedy is a shared implementation
# rather than a better comment.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The output goes through a FILE rather than a pipe. A pipe would have to be
# read while the command runs -- a reader blocked on it is a second thing that
# can hang, and it is the thing that would hang first, since a wedged command is
# precisely one that has stopped writing.
#
# `mktemp` and not a counter this function increments. Every caller so far
# invokes it inside `$( ... )` to read the output, which is a SUBSHELL: a counter
# incremented here is discarded at the closing paren, so every call would name
# the same file and two overlapping runs would read each other's output. That is
# the same defect `cluster-e2e.sh`'s own `probe_log` comment was written about,
# one level down and in the helper written to fix it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# **The cadence RAMPS, and that is a measurement.** `_e2e_poll_pause` is 0.2 s,
# which is right for `wait_until` -- it waits on a service coming up, where a
# fifth of a second is nothing. Here it was catastrophic: a command that returns
# in 16 ms is still only observed on the next tick, so the FIRST version of this
# function cost **205 ms for a command taking 0 ms** (measured: 10 x
# `run_bounded 5 true` = 2046 ms). The healthy probe `cluster-e2e` records is
# 16 ms and it makes 74 of them, so a fixture whose entire subject is fitting
# inside a 300 s CTest budget had just multiplied its own polling cost by twelve.
#
# `wait -n` would remove the polling outright and is **bash 4.3+**, so it is out
# on the platform this whole function exists for. A watchdog subshell
# (`( sleep n; kill $pid ) &`) removes it too and was rejected on a worse ground
# than portability: after `wait` reaps the child, the pid may be REUSED, and a
# watchdog that then fires signals an unrelated process. A bound that can kill a
# stranger is not a bound.
#
# So the pause starts at 10 ms and grows to `_e2e_poll_pause`. A command that
# finishes immediately costs one 10 ms tick; a five-second wait costs about a
# dozen `sleep` spawns instead of 250. Neither end is a compromise.

#   * a `wait` that outlasts a KILL -- the HOST not scheduling this shell, since a KILL
#     cannot be ignored.
#
# DERIVED, not picked: the grace plus one second, and the second is the scheduling
# allowance for the KILL and the reap, which are one syscall each. So a reading of `slow`

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The one door every perl stand-in goes through, in every fixture
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Run a perl program as THIS process, under a lifetime bound it cannot omit.
#
# In the LIBRARY, and not in `check-e2e-helpers.sh` where it was written, because a
# door in one private file reaches no other script: `compile-cache-e2e.sh` grew a perl
# peer of its own and had to spell the pair by hand, marker and all, because this was
# out of its reach.
#
# ## What it owns, and why it is one function rather than a convention
#
# Every perl stand-in a fixture runs needs the same PAIR, and neither half is optional:
#
#   `exec`  -- `$!` for a backgrounded shell FUNCTION is the subshell bash forks,
#              not the program that subshell goes on to run. Without it every
#              `kill "$listener"` of one reaps a wrapper and leaves perl
#              alive, reparented, still holding its LISTEN socket (#839).
#   `alarm` -- no trap runs under `SIGKILL`, a `ctest --timeout` or a cancelled
#              CI job, and those are the paths a leak actually accumulates on.
#              #839 measured what that costs: **1368 orphan listeners holding
#              loopback ports, the oldest 30.5 hours old**, on a fixture in the
#              DEFAULT ctest set on every platform CI builds. The expensive half
#              was the PORTS -- these fixtures draw from below the ephemeral
#              range, so the next run meets a port held by a process nobody knows
#              about and fails somewhere else entirely.
#
# They are INDEPENDENT and a survivor count cannot tell you whether either works:
# each alone drives the count to zero for a different reason, so a count reads as
# "both arms fine" while one is dead. #839's arm-independence table is what shows
# the third arm is doing real work rather than belt-and-braces, and it is quoted
# in #843 rather than restated here.
#
# Three stand-ins each spelled that pair by hand, so a fix to one reached none of
# the others (#1214) -- and the arm that can be reopened by omission is `alarm`,
# because a stand-in written without `exec` fails LOUDLY the moment the existing
# `kill` stops working. #843 is the ticket, and it happened rather than being
# hypothetical: PR #834 added `_selftest_unprompted_listener` with no bound at
# all, while the ticket about bounds was open and its diagnosis was written down.
#
# So the pair rides on the thing every stand-in must do anyway -- launching its
# perl -- and there is no argument to pass an unbounded program to. This is the
# same idiom as `Refuse` taking a row. The perl-bounds scan in
# `scripts/check-e2e-helpers.sh` is what stops a new stand-in spelling `perl` for
# itself and bypassing the door, and it also holds this door to THIS file: one
# injector marker in the tree, here, and no marked invocation elsewhere that arms an
# `alarm` of its own.
#
# ## How the bound is injected without touching the program
#
# `perl` accepts several `-e` chunks and joins them, in order, into ONE program.
# So the bound is its own chunk and the caller's body is passed through verbatim:
# the three bodies stay textually distinct, which is #1214's own constraint --
# they model three different things and concatenating perl program text as
# strings is the hazard the ticket exists to avoid, not the fix.
#
# Measured (perl 5.38.2, Linux): the two chunks compose in order, `@ARGV` after
# `--` is exactly the caller's arguments, `alarm(0)` read from the SECOND chunk
# reports 30 still pending, and a program that would run 60 s dies at 3 s with
# status 142 when armed for 3. Control: the same program with no bound chunk
# survives.
#
# ## Why the bodies wait with `select` and not `sleep`
#
# perldoc warns that `sleep` may be implemented with `alarm` on some systems, and
# the two must not then overlap -- which is why `_selftest_listener` used to arm
# its own alarm AFTER its delay rather than before. Arming here means arming
# first, so that ordering is no longer available and the question has to be
# closed rather than sequenced around.
#
# Measured on this platform it is a non-issue: `alarm 3; sleep 1; sleep 30` dies
# at exactly 3.00 s over three runs, with both controls (alarm alone dies at
# 3.00, no alarm survives). But macOS ships its own perl and cannot be measured
# from here, so the bodies use `select(undef, undef, undef, N)` -- perldoc's own
# alarm-safe spelling of a pause -- and the question does not arise on any
# platform. Stated as MEASURED on Linux and INFERRED nowhere else, deliberately.

# Reap every still-running background job of the CALLING shell: TERM, one shared
# grace, then KILL the survivors. For a fixture's `cleanup`.
#
# ## `jobs -pr`, and not a pid ledger the call sites append to
#
# This is #839's argument, arriving at the two fixtures that still had the ledger
# (#845). A ledger is per-SITE, so the next background site reopens the leak by
# forgetting one line -- and that is not hypothetical: #834 was writing exactly
# such a site while #839 was being fixed. There is nothing here to forget. Every
# still-running background job of this shell is reaped, whatever started it, on
# whichever path the fixture left by.
#
# What it cost when it leaked, so a reader does not have to go and find it: 1368
# orphan listeners holding loopback ports, the oldest 30.5 hours old. The PORTS
# were the expensive half rather than the load -- `free_port` draws by asking
# whether anything is listening, so a held LISTEN socket is precisely what its
# probe refuses, in growing numbers, on a machine several lanes share, and the
# failure surfaces in whatever OTHER fixture next draws a port.
#
# ## Two things a caller may NOT assume, and must check by enumerating its sites
#
#   * **`jobs -pr` is per-shell.** A backgrounded SUBSHELL (`( ... ) &`) is itself
#     a job and is seen; a process started INSIDE one is a grandchild and is not.
#     Measured: three plain jobs and one `( sleep & wait ) &` -- the subshell was
#     listed, its child was not. A fixture converting to this walks its `&` sites
#     and confirms none is of the second shape.
#   * **`$!` for a backgrounded shell FUNCTION is the wrapper subshell**, not the
#     program it runs. `exec` is the fix, and it is a property of the site rather
#     than of this helper.
#
# A ledger may still exist for ADDRESSING -- `cluster-e2e.sh` keeps a slot-indexed
# one so a case can stop one named node and read its status. What it must stop
# being is the thing CLEANUP depends on, because that is the copy a new site
# silently omits.
#
# ## Why it cannot be `stop_and_require_exit` in a loop
#
# Two reasons, both of which have bitten:
#
#   * that one ends in `fail`, which is `kill -TERM $_e2e_top_pid; exit 1` --
#     re-entrant inside the EXIT trap that is already firing;
#   * a bare `wait` before the KILL is UNBOUNDED, and these suites stage a
#     TERM-ignoring child on purpose. So `wait` runs only AFTER the escalation,
#     where SIGKILL is uncatchable and the reap is prompt.
#
# So this NEVER fails the run. It is cleanup; it is reached on the failing paths,
# and a cleanup that can raise its own failure buries the one being reported.
#
# ## The grace is ONE window, not one per job
#
# The signal goes to everything first, so the shutdowns overlap and a shared

# A fixture's launcher records into a state directory of the run's own
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The launcher keeps its statistics in `<state>/fastcache-cc/invocations.log`, and `-z`
# DELETES that file. A fixture that runs `-z` against the developer's state directory
# deletes their statistics; one that merely compiles appends its records to them. Both
# happened: the Windows launcher e2e did the first, and three fixtures the second.
#
# Scoped to the LAUNCHER, never the fixture's shell. The variables it resolves its state
# from include HOME, and exporting HOME across a fixture would re-home git and every
# other tool the fixture runs. So `e2e_launcher_state_enter` writes a SHIM that exports
# them and `exec`s the real launcher, and points the fixture's launcher variable at it:
# every call the fixture makes -- forty spellings in `compile-cache-e2e.sh`, a
# compiler-launcher wrapper, a nested CMake configure -- reaches the launcher through it
# without one of them being edited. The one way past it is to re-derive the real
# binary's path, which fails OPEN, and which the positive control and the caller check
# below exist to catch.
#
# The caller's logs are snapshotted by `e2e_begin`, before anything in the fixture can
# have run a launcher, so damage done BEFORE the seam is entered is measured too. They
# are judged again when the run ends, on EVERY exit: `e2e_launcher_state_enter` chains a
# check in front of the fixture's own EXIT trap, so a fixture that fails midway still
# reports what it did to the caller. That check only READS; the cleanup it hands over to
# is the fixture's own.
#
# The PowerShell twin is `Enter-E2ELauncherState` in `scripts/lib/E2EEnvironment.psm1`:
# the same variables, the same read-only guard, the same checks, and a per-call wrapper
# instead of a shim, since a `.cmd` shim would mangle `Start-Process`'s arguments.
# `launcher-state-isolation` holds the two readers of Stats.cpp to one answer, and
# `launcher-state-isolation-selftest` drives both seams against an absent, an empty and a
# present caller log.

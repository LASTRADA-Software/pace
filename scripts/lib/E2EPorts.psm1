# Per-run TCP ports for the PowerShell e2e fixtures, and what to do about a
# leftover listener -- the PowerShell half of what `free_port` and its
# surrounding argument are for the POSIX fixtures in `e2e-common.sh`.
#
# ## Why this is a module rather than three copies
#
# `#220` fixed ONE fixture. The three helpers below were written correct and left
# private to `run-launcher-e2e.ps1`, so `tls-smoke.ps1` and `run-crossdepth.ps1`
# went on binding a constant and reaping nothing -- #220's defect verbatim, with
# no failure history for the reason `.agent/rules/testing.md` names: a first
# failure MASKS its identical siblings, and `run-launcher-e2e.ps1` was simply the
# one that ran often enough to be observed (#1284).
#
# The POSIX side already paid for the duplication: seven copies of `http_get` and
# `wait_for_port` that had diverged three ways, one with no liveness check at all.
# A helper is shared only if it sits where everything that needs it can include
# from, which for PowerShell is a module next to `e2e-common.sh`.
#
# ## The four properties this must not lose
#
# None of these is new; they are what the private implementation already got
# right, and losing any one makes a shared module worse than the duplication.
#
#   1. A holder is REFUSED, never adopted -- except one whose image path is
#      byte-for-byte the daemon this run would start, which is REAPED.
#   2. A holder whose path could not be READ is refused, or the reap arm kills a
#      process the fixture knows nothing about.
#   3. Ports are drawn from BELOW the kernel's ephemeral range, and remembered.
#   4. The DECISION is what can be wrong, so it is what gets tested --
#      `Invoke-E2EPortSelfTest`, which needs no daemon, no launcher and no
#      compiler.

# 20000..32000 for the reason `free_port` in `scripts/lib/e2e-common.sh` gives in
# full: deliberately BELOW the kernel's ephemeral range, because a connect probe
# cannot see a port already held as an OUTBOUND connection's local endpoint. The
# same argument holds on Windows, whose dynamic range starts at 49152.
#
# The probe is a LISTENER bind rather than a connect: binding is what the daemon
# is about to do, so it answers the question actually being asked, and it also
# catches a port held in TIME_WAIT that nothing is listening on.
#
# Issued ports are remembered for the life of the run, because two draws a moment
# apart can both find the same port free -- the first holder has not bound it yet.
# The ledger is module scope, so every fixture in one process shares one.

# user, and neither of those means the port is free -- so a failure to NAME the

    # and the only one that runs in a loop.

    # cmdlet first put 223 ms inside every iteration of the reap wait below, whose
    # `50 x 100 ms` reads as a 5 s bound and really took ~16 s -- so the refusal

# Pure over the record above. THREE outcomes, never two.
#
# `reap` is for a leftover of THIS build -- a run that did not reach its cleanup --
# and it is a reap rather than an adoption, which is the distinction #220 asks to
# have made: adopting a stale listener is tempting and wrong, because it is of an
# unknown vintage and may hold a store from a different build, which is the class
# of confusion these fixtures exist to DETECT rather than reproduce. Killing one
# whose image path is byte-for-byte the daemon we are about to start is not
# adoption; it is the manual `Stop-Process` somebody already does.
#
# Anything else is `refuse`, by name. A port some other program holds is not a
# fixture's to take.
#
# @param holder The record from Get-E2EPortHolder, or $null.
# @param expectedPath The daemon this run would start, ABSOLUTE -- see

# The expected image path, as a holder's would be spelled.
#
# `Get-Process().Path` is always absolute and normalised, so an expected path that
# is relative or carries `..` segments can never equal one -- which silently turns
# `reap` into `refuse` for a fixture invoked the way `run-crossdepth.ps1` defaults
# to invoking itself (`$PSScriptRoot/../../out/build/...`). That is the SAFE
# direction, so it never showed up as a failure; it showed up as a reaper that
# could not fire.
#
# A path that cannot be resolved is returned unchanged rather than guessed at,
# which keeps the failure in that same safe direction.

# The refusal, as ONE template both the thrower and its test read.
#
# ## Why a template rather than a literal at each end
#
# The self-test drives the consuming fixtures as CHILD PROCESSES, so the only
# thing it can read back is this sentence. A test matching a phrase it REMEMBERS
# stops testing the day either end is reworded, and the two would be reworded
# apart -- so the expected message is built from the same template the thrower
# uses, with the same holder record.
#
# ## And never a `+` around a `-f`
#
# PowerShell binds `-f` TIGHTER than `+`, so
#
#     ("...{0}..." + "...no placeholders..." -f $a, $b)
#
# formats the SECOND fragment -- which has no placeholders, so it comes back
# unchanged -- and concatenates the first one with its `{0} {1} {2}` still in it.
# That is what this refusal did: it named the port and then said `held by {0}
# (pid {1}, {2})`, which is #220's own defect reappearing inside #220's own fix.
# The case covering it asserted only that a throw happened -- something BOTH
# states produce -- so it was green from the day it was written.

# right-hand fragment is then formatted, when the author meant to format the whole
# thing.
#

#
#     "a {0}" + "b" -f 1        ->  a {0}b
#
# so the format runs on `"b"`, which has no placeholders and comes back unchanged,
# and the left fragment keeps its `{0}` literally. It is not a syntax error and

# why it survived in `Assert-E2EPortAvailable` from the day #220 was fixed and was
# then written AGAIN, in this file, by the author of this paragraph.
#
# ## The node shape is the opposite of the reading
#
# The tempting predicate -- a `Format` node whose left operand is a `Plus` -- is
# the precedence read as it is spoken, and it matches NOTHING. Tighter binding
# means the `Format` is the INNER node: the tree is `Plus(left, Format(b, args))`.

# and was caught only by its positive control -- which is the whole argument for

#     describing it;
#   * it exits non-zero and NOT 77, because a skip is what a missing prerequisite
#     looks like and reading one as a refusal would pass this case for a fixture
#     whose pre-flight never ran;
#   * it printed THE REFUSAL -- the exact sentence, holder and all.

# The third is what the first two cannot do, and that was measured rather than
# reasoned: with the decision neutered to `free` every fixture still exited
# non-zero (it went on to start a staged empty file as a daemon) and still printed
# the port (the ACCEPTING arm announces it too), so both of the first two claims
# passed under the bug. They are what BOTH sides produce.

# PowerShell wraps an exception at the console width, so the sentence arrives
# split across lines at a column nobody chose. Matching it unflattened is a test
# whose verdict depends on the terminal -- the same trap CMake's wrapped
# diagnostics set for this repository's `cmake -P` readers.

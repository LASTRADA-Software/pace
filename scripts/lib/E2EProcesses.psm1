# Tearing down what a PowerShell e2e fixture spawned: kill it, confirm it EXITED,
# and name what did not.
#
# ## Why this is a module rather than two copies
#
# `dist-compile-e2e.ps1` ignored what `WaitForExit` answered, so an isolation
# worker that outlived the bound was still holding `iso-worker.log` when the next
# driver's `Remove-Item` reached it -- a teardown overlap reported as a fault of
# the case that ran next, with nothing naming the process.
# `node-scratch-isolation-e2e.ps1` had the same teardown, confirming nothing. A
# fix private to one fixture fixes one fixture: `.agent/rules/testing.md` says why
# a first failure MASKS its identical siblings, and `E2EPorts.psm1` is where the
# port half of the same lesson already lives.
#
# ## What a teardown owes, and what it does not
#
# A BOUND, not a guarantee: a killed process on a loaded Windows host has been seen
# to outlive five seconds, and raising the bound only moves the line. What a
# survivor may cost is a line saying so -- so the fixture must also not SHARE a
# directory or a port with whatever runs next (per run, per driver, per phase).
# The per-run half is here too: `New-E2ERunRoot` claims a root no run reuses, and
# `Clear-E2EStaleRoots` removes old ones and NAMES what holds any that will not go.

# Kill each process, then confirm each one EXITED within ONE shared bound.
#
# Returns a line for every process that did not, naming its PID and what it was
# started as (`CommandLines`, keyed by PID), and nothing when every one is gone.
# There are three answers per process, not two: exited, still running, and "could
# not be asked" -- WaitForExit throws on a handle that is gone and HasExited then
# reads `$null`, and reading either as "exited" is how a survivor goes unreported.
#

# ones, and anything thrown would replace the real diagnostic with a secondary one
# about tearing down.

# clang-tidy's HeaderFilterRegex, asked the way clang-tidy asks it: against the ABSOLUTE path a
# header was opened by, in every SPELLING a supported build opens it by. Sourced, never run --
# by `scripts/local-gate.sh`, whose coverage check is the tidy sweep's precondition, and by
# `scripts/check-tidy-header-filter.sh` (`ctest -R tidy-header-filter`), which asks the same
# question on every platform. ONE predicate and ONE table of spellings, because two copies of a
# model of `llvm::Regex` are two places to be wrong in.
#
# ## Why spellings
#
# The path clang-tidy matches is the one the preprocessor OPENED, and on Windows that is not
# the POSIX one: the MSVC compile database spells its include directories with backslashes, so
# `#include <tests/X.hpp>` opens `D:\...\src/tests/X.hpp`. `.clang-tidy` spelled every separator
# `/`, and a Windows tidy run discarded every header finding while reading clean -- measured with
# clang-tidy 22.1.8: a naming violation planted in a header under src/tests/ reported 0 times
# under that filter and twice under `[/\\]`. The gate's coverage count read 363/363 under both,
# because it matched POSIX paths only: a guard that could not fail on the defect it guards.
#
# The two dimensions are independent, and each has already shipped a defect: WHERE a checkout
# lives (#1040 -- a pattern anchored on a directory name matched CI's `.../pace/` and no
# lane worktree) and HOW its separators are spelled (the above). So a verdict is taken at a root
# AND in every spelling of it.
#
# ## The regex engine
#
# `grep -E`, POSIX extended. clang-tidy's is `llvm::Regex`, POSIX extended too, and in both a
# backslash inside a bracket expression is literal -- `[/\\]` is "a slash or a backslash". A
# MODEL of the tool rather than the tool, sound for the constructs this filter has carried
# (classes, alternation, `.*`); checked against clang-tidy itself by hand, not by a registered
# check (see `header_filter_coverage` in `local-gate.sh`).
#
# bash 3.2, because a hygiene script `ctest` runs is constrained to it.
#
# REQUIRES `scripts/lib/third-party-roots.sh` sourced first, for the core predicate as well as
# for `header_filter_declared_packages`: every classifier feeds grep through its
# `pipe_lines_into`. Unsourced, that is exit 127, which the classifiers would then report as
# the CHECK failing -- closed, but naming the wrong cause.

# Every spelling a supported build opens a header by. A NAME per row; `header_filter_spell`
# renders one. A name it does not know is refused rather than skipped, since a skipped spelling
# is one nothing checked.
HeaderFilterSpellings="posix windows msvc"

# The two ways a classifier below refuses, as its status. They are different verdicts and must
# not share a number: a filter that does not COMPILE is a fact about the FILTER, while anything
# else above grep's 1 -- a grep killed, a spelling not in the table -- is the CHECK failing. One
# status for both left a consumer to pick, and it picked one sentence for both (#1630).

# names the package's
# cache directory (`Catch2` unpacks under `.../catch2/<hash>/`). DERIVED rather than listed, so a
# dependency added tomorrow is asked about without anybody remembering this file; a comment line
# is skipped, and a NAME is taken only inside a call. Refuses -- stderr and status 2, never an
# empty answer -- when the tree declares none: zero is a parser that found nothing, not a tree
# with no dependencies. And every CALL is accounted for: one with no NAME -- the shorthand
# `CPMAddPackage("gh:owner/repo@1.0")` -- is refused BY FILE AND LINE, because dropping it would
# answer about fewer packages than the tree declares and read like the whole set; so is one whose
# NAME is spelled through a variable, which no reading of the files can resolve. Needs
# `scripts/lib/third-party-roots.sh` sourced (`first_party_paths`).
#
# The commands are a TABLE (`form` in the reader), matched case-insensitively as CMake matches
# command names, each row saying how its call names the package: `keyword` (`NAME <x>`),
# `positional` (the first argument, `CPMGetPackage(<x>)`), or `declare` -- `CPMDeclarePackage`
# records a declaration that a later `CPMGetPackage` fetches, so it is walked, so that nothing
# inside it is misread, and adds nothing by itself. Matching only `CPMAddPackage` dropped the other
# three in silence, the same fail-OPEN class as a dropped call.
#
# BLIND SPOT, and the direction it fails in: a CPM command reached INDIRECTLY --
# `cmake_language(CALL CPMAddPackage ...)`, `cmake_language(EVAL CODE ...)`, or a project wrapper
# whose own name is not in the table and which calls CPM through a variable -- is not a call this
# reader sees. It fails SILENT, which is OPEN: that package is simply absent from the derived set,
# and a header filter reaching its headers passes. Not built, deliberately: resolving it means
# evaluating CMake, which this reader exists not to do. The tree has no such call today; the table
# is where a wrapper this project writes would be added as a row.

    # quoted or bracket argument is not the NAME. An escape outside quotes -- `-DX=\"y\"` -- opens

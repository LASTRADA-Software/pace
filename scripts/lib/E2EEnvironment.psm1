# The environment a PowerShell e2e fixture starts from -- the PowerShell half of
# `e2e_scrub_fastcache_environment` in `e2e-common.sh`.
#
# The launcher, pace-kv and the node read their whole configuration from FASTCACHE_*
# variables, so one this process inherited decides what a fixture measures: an operator's
# FASTCACHE_SCHEDULER dispatches each "local" compile to their fleet, whose objects name a
# worker's scratch directory instead of the fixture's checkout, and FASTCACHE_VERIFY or
# FASTCACHE_NO_DIRECT changes the outcome a case asserts. A fixture sets what it means and
# inherits nothing.
#
# IMPORTING this module clears them, so a fixture gets that by construction rather than by
# remembering a loop: two fixtures carried their own copy, one of them wedged into the
# middle of an unrelated comment, and the rest carried none. `E2EPorts.psm1` imports it, so
# every fixture that draws a port is covered too. Import it BEFORE the fixture's own first
# `$env:FASTCACHE_*` assignment -- which is what "the fixture sets what it means" requires.

# A variable the HARNESS reads and no server or launcher does, which an operator sets on
# purpose and which a fixture must therefore see. None on this side today; the POSIX list
# names why each of its rows is there. A row here is a claim that nothing this project

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The launcher keeps its statistics in `<state>/pace-cc/invocations.log`, and `-z`
# DELETES that file. A fixture that runs `-z` against the developer's state directory
# deletes their statistics; one that merely compiles appends its records to them. Both
# happened: the Windows launcher e2e did the first, and three fixtures the second.
#
# Scoped to the LAUNCHER, never the process. LOCALAPPDATA is not the launcher's alone --
# sccache, the CPM source cache and the VS tooling read it too -- so nothing here changes
# the fixture's own environment. `Use-E2ELauncherState` redirects around ONE launcher
# child and puts the caller's values back before the next line runs, and
# `Assert-E2ELauncherFixture` -- run by each fixture at startup and again by
# `Enter-E2ELauncherState` -- refuses a fixture in which any launcher runs outside it.
#
# The POSIX twin is `e2e_launcher_state_enter` in `scripts/lib/e2e-common.sh`. It reaches
# the same scoping differently -- a shim that sets the variables and `exec`s the
# launcher, since a bash fixture spells its launcher calls in forty shapes -- and it
# reads Stats.cpp with its own reader. `launcher-state-isolation` holds the two readers
# to one answer, and requires every fixture handed a launcher to call one seam or the other.

# launcher learns to honour later is redirected without anybody remembering this file.

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    The invocation log's LAYOUT, read out of Stats.cpp rather than restated: the version this
    build writes (`v` and `CurrentLogVersion`) and the names of `LogColumnTable`'s columns, in
    the order they are written. The POSIX twin is `e2e_launcher_log_layout`.
.DESCRIPTION
    A line the launcher writes opens with that version and then those columns; a line with no
    version is the layout from before versions, the same columns in the same order up to its
    arity. Read by NAME because a column's position is not the launcher's contract, the version
    is: the readers this replaces took the outcome as the first field and the source as the
    fifth, and once the log named its version the outcome read `v2` and the caller-damage check
    compared every record's elapsed time against the run's trees -- reporting a leak as clean.
    Throws rather than guessing when either half is not found, and when the names it read are
    fewer than the table's `LogColumn::` rows: a name outside `[a-z-]+` skipped in silence would
    shift every later column by one.

.SYNOPSIS
    The environment variables the launcher's state directory is resolved from ON ONE
    PLATFORM, read out of `StateDirectoryImpl`, one row per variable in the order the source
    reads them: its Name, and the BaseSuffix the launcher appends when that variable is the
    base (`/.local/state` for HOME).
.PARAMETER Platform
    `windows` or `posix`; this process's by default. Only that branch of
    `#if defined(_WIN32)` / `#else` / `#endif` is read: redirecting a variable the launcher
    does not read there is not harmless, since its children -- `cl`, `clang-cl` -- inherit it.
.DESCRIPTION
    Throws rather than guessing: a body it cannot find, any other preprocessor line, a
    variable read that is never a base, or a base built from something that is not a
    variable read. A partial answer is the one that leaks. What this reader cannot see at
    all -- a base from a helper, or from `std::getenv` -- is caught by the read-only guard
    in `Enter-E2ELauncherState`, which asks the launcher itself.

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Every `$Launcher` reference in @Tree -- `$script:`, `$global:`, `$using:` and `${}`
    spellings included -- that could run the launcher outside `Use-E2ELauncherState`.
.DESCRIPTION
    A reference is accepted when it declares the parameter, writes the variable, is the
    operand of `-not`, sits inside a `Use-E2ELauncherState` block, is handed by `Start-Job`
    to a block parameter named `Launcher`, or its NEAREST enclosing command is an exemption
    that does not run it -- only the nearest, so `Write-Host "$(& $Launcher -z)"` is not
    laundered by the outer command -- and, for a command that returns a derived path, whose
    result ends at a KNOWN sink (`Test-E2ELauncherResultReachesSink`); any other consumer of
    it -- a pipeline stage, a method, `Get-Item`, `cmd /c`, a hashtable -- is refused. Every
    other reference is refused, which makes an alias (`$cc = $Launcher`) a refusal as well
    as a bare call.

    Blind spots, each failing OPEN, and caught at run time by the positive control and the
    caller check instead:
      * a launcher reached without naming `$Launcher` at all -- a second copy of the path
        taken from the command line, `Get-Variable -Name ("Laun" + "cher") -ValueOnly`, or
        `$ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.ExpandString('$Launcher')`. The bound parameter
        IS counted, as `$PSBoundParameters["Launcher"]`, `$PSBoundParameters.Launcher` and
        `$MyInvocation.BoundParameters.Launcher` (`Test-E2ELauncherBoundParameter`);

    Refuse a fixture any of whose launcher executions sits outside `Use-E2ELauncherState`.

.PARAMETER Fixture
    The fixture script, read as a syntax tree -- never run.
.DESCRIPTION
    A fixture calls this at STARTUP, before its skips and its self-test modes, so a machine
    that skips the fixture -- no compiler, no built binary -- still judges it; and
    `Enter-E2ELauncherState` calls it again, so a fixture that enters the seam is held to it
    whatever it did first. The scan's own control rows run first: a scan that refuses
    nothing is not evidence that the fixture is clean. A fixture with no `$Launcher`
    reference at all is refused as well, because a renamed variable would read as clean.

    The FIRST call also snapshots the caller's logs, before anything in the fixture can
    have run a launcher; the end-of-run check judges against that picture.

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Give a fixture's launcher a state directory of the run's own. Returns the handle every

.PARAMETER Launcher
    The launcher the fixture runs.
.PARAMETER Fixture
    The fixture script, whose every launcher execution must sit inside
    `Use-E2ELauncherState` -- scanned here, so a fixture that enters the seam is held to it.
.PARAMETER RunTrees
    Directories this run's sources live under: a caller record naming one is this run's.
.DESCRIPTION
    Before returning it asks the LAUNCHER where it will record, through the wrapper:
    `--show-stats` names the log only while the log is absent or empty, which a fresh root
    always is, so the question is read-only -- `-z` names it too, but only by deleting what
    is there, which would destroy the caller's log on exactly the failure being checked.
    Refused both ways a redirect can miss: a path outside the root, or a report naming no
    path. Call it INSIDE the `try` whose `finally` calls `Exit-E2ELauncherState`.

.DESCRIPTION
    What @Run writes to the pipeline is what this returns; `$LASTEXITCODE` is global and
    survives. The launcher's own children (`cl`, `clang-cl`) inherit the redirect, which is
    why only the variables the launcher reads on this platform are redirected. A case that
    must count its own records points @Handle.Root somewhere of its own for the length of
    the case. The block runs in a child of THIS scope, so this function's locals carry names
    no call site uses.

.DESCRIPTION

    record of this run: other builds on the machine may create it meanwhile, and are told
    apart by the source each record names. Blind spot, failing OPEN: a record whose source
    is relative, or spelled through a `subst` drive or an 8.3 name, names no run tree.

# A job gated on the scope classifier must FAIL SAFE when the classifier does not
# answer.
#
# ## The defect this exists to stop returning
#
# `scripts/ci-scope.sh` states its own rule at length: every way of not knowing —
# an unresolvable ref, a failed diff, an empty diff, a path matching no row —
# escalates to `code=true`, because *"we could not tell what changed" must never
# read as "nothing did"*.
#
# The workflow reading it inverted that principle one level up. Sixteen jobs were
# gated `if: needs.changes.outputs.code == 'true'`, and if the `changes` job
# itself FAILS there is no output at all: the comparison is false, the jobs are
# skipped, and — measured on the head of the docs-only #356 (`b4777aa`) — a
# skipped required context reports `conclusion: skipped` and the ruleset reads it
# as **passing**. `changes` is not itself a required context. So a classifier
# that died produced a green, mergeable pull request that nothing had compiled:
# the exact outcome `ci-scope.sh`'s own header warns about, reached through the
# workflow rather than through the script.
#
# The fix is one token — `!= 'false'` rather than `== 'true'` — which makes "did
# not answer" mean build-everything, agreeing with the script it reads. Plus
# `!cancelled()`, so a failed dependency does not skip the job before its
# condition is even consulted.
#
# ## Why it is a check and not sixteen careful edits
#
# Sixteen hand-edits with nothing asserting them is how this comes back. A
# reviewer cannot eyeball thirty-six conditions; what makes the tree safe is that
# the SEVENTEENTH job cannot be added wrong.
#
# Both rules are derived from the workflow rather than tabulated — a hand-written
# list of gated job names would not be a cross-check, it would be a second thing
# to be wrong, the same reasoning `check-tsan-scope.cmake` and
# `check-merge-queue-contexts.sh` record. `release` needs `changes` too and is
# correctly excluded by construction: it never reads the classifier's output, so
# rule B never applies to it, and a release must NOT run when jobs have failed.
#
# ## And the third rule: the checks whose SUBJECT is documentation are NOT gated
#
# The two rules above are about a gate failing safe. The third is about a gate
# that should never have been there. #687: every check whose subject is
# documentation was skipped on exactly the pull requests that change
# documentation, because `code=false` is right for a compiler and backwards for a
# check that reads prose. Prose drifts by being edited, and a prose-only edit is
# the change those checks never saw.
#
# So `scripts/doc-subject-checks.sh` runs from a step carrying no scope condition
# at all -- and that step lives in a job producing a REQUIRED context, because a
# doc check in an unrequired job is #684: a failure reported nowhere, on a pull
# request that merges green. Fixing #687 by reintroducing #684 one file over is
# not a fix, and the two properties are independent, so both are asserted.
#
# The required-context list is READ from `scripts/check-merge-queue-contexts.sh`,
# not restated. A second copy is not a cross-check, it is a second thing to be
# wrong.
#
# ## And the fourth rule: a job that gates the release survives a tag run
#
# #559 trimmed six jobs off the master push, because a push run buys no merge
# latency -- it happens after the merge -- and those six write no cache entry any
# other run can read. That is the first condition in this workflow keyed on the
# EVENT rather than on the scope classifier, and it introduces a failure the
# three rules above cannot see.
#
# `release` needs every other job in this file, and `check-release-gate` asserts
# that list stays complete. A `needs` job that is SKIPPED skips its dependent --
# `release` carries `if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v')`, which has no
# status function, so GitHub still ANDs `success()` onto it. So a condition that
# excludes a tag run does not fail the release: it makes the release job vanish,
# and a tag would be pushed, every check would be green, and no draft would ever
# appear. The `changes` job already states the invariant this depends on in a
# comment -- *"on a tag nothing below is ever skipped"* -- and nothing asserted
# it.
#
# This check evaluates a GitHub expression only where a job's MATRIX decides it
# (rule F, #1540), and an event-keyed condition is decided by no matrix, so this
# asserts the SPELLING instead: an event-keyed condition on a job that gates the release must contain
# the exact clause `github.ref_type != 'branch'`, which is the one clause that
# lets a tag through. Any other spelling is refused by name rather than analysed
# -- the same answer rule A gives a classifier read in a shape it does not
# recognise, and for the same reason: a check that cannot vouch for something
# must say so rather than pass it.
#
# The gating set is READ from `release.needs`, never restated, and an empty read
# is a refusal: with no gating jobs every condition would look unregulated and
# this rule would vouch for all of them, which is rule C's empty-table failure
# one file over.
#
# ## And the fifth rule: a ccache step saves on a branch push and nowhere else
#
# #558. The four rules above are about a job RUNNING or not; this one is about a
# step WRITING or not, and its failure is invisible in a way none of theirs is:
# every check stays green, every build succeeds, and the only symptom is that the
# repository's shared 10 GB Actions cache is over its cap and evicting, which
# nothing attributes to any run.
#
# `hendrikmuhs/ccache-action` appends a timestamp to its key, so a run that saves
# writes a NEW entry rather than updating one. On a pull request that entry is
# scoped to `refs/pull/<n>/merge`, and MEASURED (run 33941494414, 2026-09-05, a
# branch pushed more than once) the writing branch does not read it back: all
# seven of that run's restores came from `refs/heads/master`, because the
# restore-key prefix matches many entries, the newest wins, and master writes a
# fresh one on every merge. So a pull-request write is not a trade -- it is
# eviction pressure on the entries every run, the writer's own included, actually
# reads.
#
# Two substrings are required, and the second is the one that looks redundant:
# `github.event_name == 'push'` alone still saves on a TAG push, into a
# `refs/tags/v*` scope nothing can ever read, a full set of entries per release.
# That is rule D's clause arriving from the opposite side -- there a tag must not
# be SKIPPED, here it must not SAVE -- and the same sentence explains both: a tag
# push is a push.
#
# Any other spelling, `save: false` included, is refused by name rather than
# analysed, which is the answer rules A and D already give a shape they do not
# recognise. A workflow with no ccache step at all has nothing to vouch for and
# says so; that is not the same claim as a table read coming back empty, because
# here the steps are the SUBJECT rather than an input this rule depends on.

# ## What is asserted rather than demonstrated
#
# The `changes` job cannot be made to fail on demand, so this proves the SHAPE of
# the conditions, not the behaviour of a run in which the classifier died. The
# behaviour it relies on is the measurement above (`b4777aa`), which is recorded
# in `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` rather than re-derived here.
#
# ## bash 3.2, and a self-test
#
# In the default ctest set, so it runs on macOS's 2007 `/bin/bash`: no `mapfile`,
# no `declare -A`, no `${var^^}`. And `--self-test` drives every rule against
# GENERATED workflows in both directions -- for two runs these three rules had
# only ever been seen to PASS, which is the state this whole file is about one
# level up. Generated rather than edited from a copy: an edit that matches no
# anchor changes nothing and reports success.

# Rule C read four fields with two that can legitimately be empty, and when the

# Rule F: exactly one job WRITES any cache key; every other job restores it.
#
# `actions/cache` reserves the key when it saves, so a second writer that
# finishes second finds it taken and DISCARDS an archive it has already paid to
# build and upload. Sharing a key is right whenever the content is identical --
# a second key would spend the repository's 10 GB budget twice -- so the fix is
# never a second key, it is `actions/cache/restore` (#318).
#
# The comment standing where this check now runs said the two jobs shared a key
# because "a second entry would only cost the budget twice". That is true, and
# it described the defect approvingly for months: prose cannot fail, and a third
# job copying the obvious `uses:` line would have made it worse in silence.
#
# The comparison is on the RESOLVED key, and that is the whole difficulty. The
# text `cpm-${{ runner.os }}-package-...` appears in three jobs and collides in
# none of them, while `cpm-${{ runner.os }}-clang-debug-...` appeared in two jobs
# on ONE runner and was the defect. Measured on this tree: a check reading the
# raw text flags five groups, four of which are simply different operating
# systems, so it refuses a correct workflow. `runner.os` is therefore resolved
# from `runs-on`, and both are resolved PER COMBINATION of the job's matrix,
# which the shared walk computes with GitHub's semantics (#1432): `runs-on` may
# itself be `${{ matrix.runner }}`, an `include` row that fits no base
# combination is a leg of its own, and a key a leg lacks expands to NOTHING,
# as GitHub substitutes it.
#
# Every leg is a WRITER. A step whose key varies with the legs is several keys,
# one each; a step whose key does NOT vary with them is one key written by every
# leg at once -- legs of one job run concurrently exactly as two jobs do, so that
# is #318 arriving through a matrix, and it is compared like any other pair.
#
# Unless the step's own `if:` rules the leg OUT (#1540), which is how a cache is
# restored everywhere and saved once. Only a condition the shared walk can DECIDE
# from the leg's matrix values rules one out; an undecidable term leaves the leg a
# writer, which is the direction that keeps the refusal. A key taken from a step
# output is refused as unresolvable: each leg computes its own.
#
# Ruling legs out opened the OTHER direction, so it is refused too: a key some leg
# RESTORES that no step any leg can run WRITES. Two writers cost an upload; none
# costs the cache, silently -- every run misses the exact key, a `restore-keys`
# prefix at best hands back an entry saved for a different key, and the job reads
# as cached. The shape that arrives there is a save guarded PER JOB, by a matrix
# value only one key's legs carry, in a job whose legs use several keys. Only the
# restore action is asked about. The combined action restores as well, but only
# the key it writes itself, in the same row, so its key cannot be unwritten; the
# same holds for `ccache-action`. Only `key:` is compared: a `restore-keys`
# prefix is not a key, so it neither needs a writer nor supplies one -- a prefix
# matching some other key's entry is exactly the silent miss above. And the writer
# must be in this workflow; a key saved only by another file is refused here,
# since nothing in this one would notice that file stop.
#
# What is compared is key TEXT, and GitHub finds an entry by key AND a version
# hashed from `path:` as the runner expanded it plus the compression it chose. So
# two legs on runners that disagree on either -- `windows-2025` and `windows-11-arm`
# disagree on both -- share no entry under one key text. So this check PASSES a
# restore whose only writer is such a leg, a false GREEN; and it REFUSES two such
# legs as writers of one key although they write two entries, a false red whose
# remedy (vary the key) is what those legs need anyway. Neither half can be read
# from the workflow, so `build.yml` says at each shared key what is known of it.
#
# Every other `${{ ... }}` is left as text deliberately: `hashFiles('CMakeLists.txt')`
# resolves to the same digest in every job of one run, so two steps spelling it
# identically DO collide and must be compared rather than excused. What is
# refused rather than compared is a row the walk could not resolve -- a matrix it
# cannot read, a matrix reference it left unexpanded -- and a key still naming
# `runner.` after resolution: a key this check cannot resolve is one it cannot
# vouch for in either direction, and vouching for it is the silent half.

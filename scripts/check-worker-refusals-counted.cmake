# Every refusal a `0xFC` surface answers with is routed through one of three named
# spellings, and no file reaches the raw encoder.
#
# Six sites in `WorkerProtocol.cpp` used to answer on the wire and increment nothing
# ([#327](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/327)). A refusal
# answered while nothing rises is how a port being probed looks, on `/metrics`,
# exactly like a port nobody is talking to -- and the six were not a coincidence but
# the default: `CompileCacheWire::EncodeErrorReply` takes a code and knows nothing
# about a sink, so counting was a thing each author had to remember.
#
# ## What this check used to be, and why that was not enough
#
# It scanned a HAND-MAINTAINED LIST of the `.cpp` files somebody had remembered. The
# list grew by hand twice -- `CompileResponder.cpp` was added after arriving with
# uncounted refusals in it, then `FrameEndpoint.cpp` after accumulating FIVE of them
# through an entire surface migration with this check green throughout (#447). It
# could not reach a header at all, which is where #447 then had to put two security
# counters.
#
# The list was exact about the files it knew and SILENT about the ones it did not,
# and silence reads identically to complete coverage
# ([#492](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/492)). So the list is
# gone: this globs `src/`, headers included, and a new file answering a refusal fails
# it on the first bare call with nobody editing anything. An over-broad scan fails
# CLOSED -- a file that should not be scanned produces a visible failure somebody
# investigates, where a file that should be scanned and is not produces nothing.
#
# ## The rule
#
# **`EncodeErrorReply` is called from `Protocol/SurfaceRefusal.hpp` and nowhere else.**
#
# Two files are named below and neither is a list of surfaces: they are the two ends
# of one function. `CompileCacheWire.hpp` DEFINES the encoder, and `SurfaceRefusal.hpp`
# holds the three spellings every surface reaches it through. Every other file in
# `src/` must contain no call at all. Adding a row here is the only way to weaken this
# check, which makes weakening it a visible, argued edit rather than an omission --
# the opposite failure direction from the list this replaced.
#
# ## The three spellings, and why the third is counted rather than forbidden
#
# `Refuse` alone was not enough, and the reason is the defect that outlived #327's
# fix. Some refusals are DELIBERATELY not counted -- the in-flight byte budget says a
# surface is momentarily full, the peer retries past it, and summed into a credential
# series it makes that series unreadable. That is a considered position. But it was
# spelled as a bare `EncodeErrorReply`, which is also how "forgot" is spelled, so no
# scan could tell a considered decision from an accumulated defect.
#
# So `RefuseWithoutCounter` states the decision and carries its reason, and
# `RefuseUntriaged` states the ABSENCE of one and carries the issue that will make it.
# The third was not a loophole precisely because this check TALLIES it and prints the
# total on every run: the backlog was visible and monotonic, a new one could not be
# added silently, and the issues it pointed at got a mechanical completion test instead
# of a judgement call.
#
# **That tally is now an assertion, because #494 drove it to zero.** A count could only
# ever be published and watched, which is how five sites accumulated behind a green
# check the last time (#447); an empty backlog is the one state in which the same
# reading becomes a guard. Adding an untriaged refusal is still legitimate and is no
# longer SILENT: file the issue that will decide it and relax the assertion at the foot
# of this file in the same change.
#
# Comments naming the function are prose, not calls, for the reason
# `check-target-file-guards` records: this file's own header describes the thing it
# checks, and a checker that failed on its own documentation would be a checker
# nobody could document.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`: it reads files, compares strings and reports. See
# `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports failure through its
# OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -P scripts/check-worker-refusals-counted.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

# A `cmake -P` script has no project, so every policy starts unset and CMP0057
# (`if(... IN_LIST ...)`) is one of them -- unset, the operator is an unknown
# argument and the script errors out rather than answering. Stated as a minimum
# version so the whole set moves together with the project's own.
#
# This was already written down in `check-node-config-reference.cmake`, and this
# script shipped without it: green on CMake 4.3.1, dead on 3.28, which is the
# version this project declares and the one CI runs. A check that errors out is
# not a check that passed -- but it reports through the same channel, so only the
# gate on the OTHER platform could tell the difference.

# Reading a file as LINES, without ever building a CMake list.
#
# Every other hygiene check splits content into a `;`-joined list and iterates it.
# That is where the hazards live: a `;` in the text becomes a separator, a trailing
# `\` escapes the separator, and -- the one that cost this check -- an UNBALANCED
# `[` or `]` makes CMake's list parser swallow every following element into one.
#
# Measured, because the tree stated a broader rule than the real one:
#
#     plain content              3 elements
#     one unbalanced `[`         1 element   (everything merged)
#     one unbalanced `]`         1 element   (everything merged)
#     balanced `[[nodiscard]]`   3 elements  (harmless)
#
# Only UNBALANCED brackets group. That distinction is why this check cannot use the
# neutralise-the-brackets fix the others use: it derives its refusal spellings from
# declarations that read `[[nodiscard]] inline std::vector<std::byte> Refuse(`, so
# replacing brackets took it from three spellings to ZERO. Escaping is not available
# either -- `\[` is not a valid CMake escape sequence.
#
# So this walks the newlines directly and never makes a list. Immune by construction
# rather than by neutralising the characters that happen to be dangerous today, and
# the text is preserved EXACTLY, which is what a check that matches on `[[nodiscard]]`
# and reports `file:line` needs.

# right here, as the FILTER.

# It was a global equality -- one `.issue =` field per `RefuseUntriaged(` call -- and
# that reads a construct rather than a rule. A row built once and reused, which is this
# project's own idiom for `SurfaceRefusal` rows two files away, is two calls and one
# field: correct code, aborting the whole check with "the scan has drifted". A stray
# `.issue` on any scanned line failed it the same way. Both are the instrument
# mistaking its own reading for the tree.
#
# What actually has to hold is that every file with untriaged refusals NAMES the issue
# that will decide them. That is the property the backlog rests on, it is per file, and
# it holds however the calls are spelled.

# Every `pace-node` flag that `pacectl --help` sends an operator to
# is an option that binary actually has.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# `pacectl --help` carries a NOTES paragraph naming the operator actions that live
# only in the other binary -- enrollment and `--print-surfaces` -- because an operator
# who has learned one tool cannot otherwise discover the other half of the surface
# (#1307). That paragraph is prose in one executable about another executable's flag
# table, and nothing else connects the two: rename `--enroll-list` in `NodeConfig.cpp`
# and every test in both binaries stays green while the help sends people to a flag that
# does not exist. A sentence is not a reader.
#
# So this asks the BINARIES, which are the subject, rather than grepping either source
# tree: the flags a node accepts are whatever its `--help` lists as option rows, however
# many tables they are assembled from, and a source scan would have to know that set.
#
# ## What it checks, precisely
#
#   * Only NOTES paragraphs that name `pace-node`. A flag cited anywhere
#     else in `pacectl --help` is `pacectl`'s own and is not this check's.
#   * A cited flag must be an option ROW of the node's help: a line that starts with that
#     flag at the row indent. A flag mentioned only inside another row's description
#     (`--scheduler` appears in a dozen, some of them opening a wrapped line) is not an
#     option, and whole-token matching is what stops `--enroll` passing because
#     `--enroll-list` exists.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, stated rather than left to be discovered
#
#   * Whether the paragraph's WORDS about each flag are true. That is a judgement about
#     prose; this check only refuses a citation of something that is not there.
#   * Flags the node has and the paragraph does not mention. Naming every node flag is
#     not the paragraph's job.
#
# ## Constraints
#
# bash 3.2 (macOS ships a 2007 `/bin/bash` and this runs in the default ctest set): no
# `mapfile`, `declare -A`, `${var^^}` or `local -n`. No `producer | grep -q` under
# `pipefail`. Input is read with CRs stripped, because a Windows executable writes its
# help in text mode.

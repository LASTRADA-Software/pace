# `worker-refusals-counted` must be seen to FAIL, on a file nobody listed.
#
# The check it drives replaced a hand-maintained list of source files with a glob,
# because the list was exact about the files it knew and silent about the ones it did
# not -- and silence reads identically to complete coverage
# ([#492](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/492)). A glob is only
# worth more than the list if it actually bites on a file that was never named, and
# **a guard nobody has seen fire is not a guard**.
#
# So this drives the real check against SYNTHETIC source trees and asserts each
# verdict. The trees are built here rather than in the repository: a fixture file
# containing a bare `EncodeErrorReply` inside `src/` would be a violation of the very
# rule under test, and excluding it would put a hole in the thing being proved.
#
# ## Why it inverts here rather than with `WILL_FAIL`
#
# `WILL_FAIL` on a whole test says only "something came back red". This asserts each
# direction separately and names which one broke -- a check that stopped refusing and
# a check that started refusing everything are opposite defects, and a bare inversion
# reports them identically. That is the same distinction
# `node-scratch-isolation-e2e-selftest` draws: **a classifier that cannot be made to
# say every one of its verdicts has not been shown to classify anything.**
#
# ## Why `cmake -P` and not a shell script
#
# Two reasons, both of which this project has paid for. A hygiene script `ctest` runs
# is constrained to bash 3.2, because macOS ships a 2007 `/bin/bash`. And
# `producer | grep -q` is a false NEGATIVE under `set -o pipefail`, on the SUCCESS
# path, because `grep -q` exits at the first match and the producer dies of SIGPIPE.
# Staying in CMake means neither applies rather than surviving both: `execute_process`
# hands back the output as a variable and `string(FIND)` matches it afterwards, which
# is the shape those two rules argue for anyway.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DFASTCACHED_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-worker-refusals-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

# A `cmake -P` script has no project, so every policy starts unset and CMP0057
# (`if(... IN_LIST ...)`) is one of them -- unset, the operator is an unknown
# argument and the script errors out rather than answering. Stated as a minimum
# version so the whole set moves together with the project's own.
#
# This was already written down in `check-node-config-reference.cmake`, and this
# script shipped without it: green on CMake 4.3.1, dead on 3.28, which is the
# version this project declares and the one CI runs. A check that errors out is
# not a check that passed -- but it reports through the same channel, so only the
# gate on the OTHER platform could tell the difference.

# Every `RequiredContexts=(` declaration says at its own site whether it is THE table
# or a fixture, and says why.
#
# ## The failure this refuses
#
# Four files under `scripts/` declare an array literally named `RequiredContexts=(` and
# only ONE of them is authoritative. Three are self-test fixtures, and the 11-row one in
# `check-merge-group-report.sh` is a strict SUBSET of the live 14-row table whose every
# row is a real context name.
#
# That subset is the dangerous shape, and it is dangerous precisely because nothing about
# it looks wrong: a reader pointed at it checks 11 real contexts, finds 11 of them
# reported and passing, and reports a TRUE statement about a set nobody asked about. It
# fails toward a confident green, and it is short in the direction that cannot be noticed
# -- three fewer contexts than required, all three of them the expensive ones
# (`clang-asan-ubsan`, `clang-tsan`, `Check the PR body's closing keywords`).
#
# It is a live instance, not a hypothetical (#1360): a lane's hand-rolled reader read the
# fixture, reported 11 of 11 as complete, and did it on a pull request that had already
# merged.
#
# ## Why the guard could not live inside a reader
#
# `ci-pr-required.sh` already refuses when not ONE check run matches a required name --
# and that guard cannot catch this, because 11 of 11 matched real contexts. Its actual
# protection is that it pins the SOURCE FILE. So the defect is choosing the wrong file,
# which no amount of care inside a reader detects.
#
# ## Why markers at the SITE rather than a table in here
#
# A table of exempt files in this script and a set of declarations in the tree are two
# copies meant to stay equal, which is the shape `AGENT.md` refuses. It also puts the
# warning where only this file's reader meets it, and the person who needs warning is the
# one who just landed on a fixture by searching for `RequiredContexts=(`. A marker in the
# comment block immediately above the declaration is the only placement that is there
# when they arrive -- and it removes the STALE-row class by construction, because the
# marker travels with the thing it describes.
#
# What remains stale-able is a marker whose declaration has GONE, and rule 6 refuses that.
#
# ## Renaming the fixtures was the cheaper fix and is NOT available
#
# The obvious repair is to stop the fixtures sharing the name. It cannot be done: three
# readers (`ci-pr-required.sh`, `ci-merge-group-report.sh`, `check-gated-jobs.sh`) find
# the table with `/^RequiredContexts=\(/`, so the array NAME is a wire contract between a
# fixture file and the reader under test. Renaming it makes the fixtures test nothing.
# Said here because it reads as the obvious first move and costs a round trip to refute.
#
# ## Scope, stated rather than left to the pattern
#
# Every regular file under `scripts/`, recursively. That is where every declaration and
# every reader lives today. A scan is silent about what it cannot reach and silence reads
# identically to complete coverage (#492), so the file count is printed on every run and
# an empty scan is a REFUSAL rather than a pass.

# One awk pass per file, emitting records. Space-separated with the free text LAST, so
# `read -r kind file line rest` cannot lose a field -- `IFS=$'\t' read` does not read TSV
# (tab is IFS whitespace, so an empty field collapses and shifts every field after it).
# No path under `scripts/` contains a space, asserted by the scan itself below.
#
#   DECL    <file> <line> <indent>          a declaration, and how far it is indented
#   HDRMARK <file> <line> <declLine> <kind> <reason...>   a marker in a declaration's header
#   ORPHAN  <file> <line> <kind>            a marker belonging to no declaration
#   ROW     <file> <declLine> <text>        a quoted row of a declaration
#   READER  <file> <line> <path>            a reader's defaulted table path (rule 5)
#
# A DECLARATION is a line whose first non-blank characters are exactly
# `RequiredContexts=(`. That is deliberately BROADER than the readers, which anchor at
# column 0 -- an indented declaration is one `source` can see and the three awk readers
# cannot, so the two disagree about whether it exists at all. Rule 7 refuses it.
#
# A comment line, a `printf` staging the token and a `grep` pattern containing it are all
# NOT declarations, because none of them starts with it. A COMMENT is not a call site.

# ONE awk over every file named after @p 1, not one per file: a process start per file is what a loaded Windows

# file's first line, and the markers still pending at a file's end are flushed there and at END, so the records are
# the ones a per-file run printed, in the same order.

#
# ## Why this exists rather than a paragraph
#
# `scripts/tsan-gate.sh` runs the canary ONCE and refuses the whole suite if the
# race is not reported. That is the correct thing to do -- a suite whose sanitizer
# cannot be shown live is meaningless -- but it makes the canary's reliability a
# property of the CI job's flake rate rather than of anything anyone can inspect.
#
# The canary used to be silent in 2-4% of runs (#473), and the cost of that is not
# the red build. It is that a gate which is red a few percent of the time teaches
# everyone to re-run it, and a gate people reflexively re-run is disarmed exactly
# as thoroughly as one that was deleted. That failure arrives through habit, not
# through code, so "it passed when I tried it" is not the evidence that settles
# it. A RATE is.
#
# So the acceptance for a change to `src/tests/TsanCanary.cpp` is a rate over at
# least a few hundred runs, recorded, and reproducible by whoever next doubts it.
# This is that instrument. Measured at roughly 27 ms a run on a 32-core box --
# about eight seconds for the default 300, and a couple of minutes for the five
# thousand this canary was accepted on. That cost is a process spawn and a
# sanitized start-up rather than the race itself, so it is set by the machine
# and not by the loop: 29.2 ms for the current canary's sixteen thousand
# increments against 26.0 ms for the thousand-increment one it replaced.
#
# ## What it does NOT tell you
#
# A rate measured here is a rate on THIS machine, at this core count, under this
# load. The silent runs are a timing phenomenon, so a different box can differ --
# which is why the pinned arm exists: `--pin 0,1` narrows the machine to two CPUs
# and is the closest thing available locally to a two-core CI runner. Report both
# numbers, or the figure carries a condition it does not state.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = the rate is at or below the threshold; 1 = it is above it, or a
# prerequisite is missing. It is not registered as a ctest: a few hundred runs of
# a sanitized binary is not something to put in the default set, and pinning it to
# one threshold in CI would make it the flaky gate it exists to prevent.

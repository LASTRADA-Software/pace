# Refuses when a file under `vendor/` no longer matches `vendor/MANIFEST`, or differs from
# upstream without being declared as a local change in `vendor/VENDOR.md`.
#
# `vendor/` holds third-party source copied VERBATIM from upstream, and verbatim is
# load-bearing rather than tidy: the diff against the UPSTREAM fork points in
# vendor/VENDOR.md is what gets sent back, so a vendored file edited in place quietly
# converts a contributable copy into a private fork. Nothing else notices. The build stays
# green, the tests pass, and the discovery comes months later when somebody tries to
# upstream a fix and finds the diff full of unrelated local edits.
#
# `.clang-format-ignore` already stops the MECHANICAL drift -- measured, the
# formatter would rewrite 146 of 165 vendored files on its first run. This covers
# the deliberate kind: a one-line fix applied where it was found rather than where
# it belongs.
#
# WHY A CONTENT MANIFEST rather than "diff against the import commit": a SHA anchor
# does not survive the branch. Every rebase, `/absorb` and autosquash rewrites the
# import commit, orphaning any range recorded against it -- and a range anchored to
# a commit that no longer exists does not fail, it silently widens. Content does not
# move.
#
# WHY SHA-256 AND NOT GIT: this must answer in a source export, which has no index.
# The generator and the checker are the same script for the same reason -- two
# spellings of "how the hash is computed" is one source of truth too many, and they
# would disagree exactly once, in the direction of reporting clean.
#
# ## A declared local change and an accidental edit are told apart
#
# Until #1375 they were not. The manifest held one hash per file, and regenerating it made
# the tree match again whatever had been edited. So the "record it in VENDOR.md in the same
# commit" instruction was the only thing standing between a deliberate local change and a
# stray edit silenced by a regeneration, and nothing checked it.
#
# So each manifest line also says whether its bytes are still UPSTREAM's:
#
#   <sha256>  <path>                               verbatim: upstream's bytes at the fork point
#   <sha256>  <path>  local-change-of <sha256>     differs from upstream, whose hash is recorded
#   <sha256>  <path>  local-change-new             not in upstream at all
#
# Regenerating never decides that a file is upstream's. It carries the upstream hash forward
# from the manifest it replaces: a verbatim file whose bytes changed becomes
# `local-change-of <its previous hash>`, a local change edited back to its upstream hash
# becomes verbatim again, and a file the old manifest did not list is `local-change-new`.
# Then every `local-change-*` line must be declared by a row of VENDOR.md's "Local changes"
# table naming its path, and every path such a row names must be a local change. So a
# regeneration can no longer silence an edit. It turns an undeclared edit into a refusal
# that names the file.
#
# `RESYNC` is the one spelling that marks files upstream's, because after a re-sync every
# file of that copy IS: the import reads upstream at a pinned version and compares each one
# (VENDOR.md, "How to re-sync"). It is a claim this script cannot verify, which is why it
# is a separate word rather than the default.
#
# ## Every third-party root, and a re-sync names ONE of them
#
# The roots are `scripts/lib/third-party-roots.txt`, read here rather than restated, so a new
# upstream copy is hashed, compared and declared by the same rules the day its row is added
# (#178 added the second, `vendor/monocypher`). Each root must hold files: a root that walks to
# nothing is refused by name, since the whole tree being non-empty says nothing about one copy.
#
# A re-sync is of ONE upstream, so `RESYNC` takes the root it is about in
# `PACE_VENDOR_RESYNC_ROOT` and marks only that root's files upstream's; every other root
# is carried forward exactly as `ON` carries it. A bare RESYNC that blessed every root would
# silence each OTHER copy's local changes -- the regeneration defect above, reached through the
# one word that is allowed to bless. The first import of a root is a re-sync of it.
#
# Not covered: a vendored file DELETED locally. The manifest describes the tree, so a
# deletion regenerates away with no declaration. The vendor build's partition assertion
# refuses a missing source, so this is covered for translation units and not for headers.
#
# Regenerate with -DPACE_VENDOR_WRITE_MANIFEST=ON, or with =RESYNC plus
# -DPACE_VENDOR_RESYNC_ROOT=<root> after a re-sync or the first import of that root.

    "vendor/ is third-party source copied verbatim from upstream, and the copy is only "
    "worth having while it stays diffable against the UPSTREAM fork points recorded in "
    "vendor/VENDOR.md -- that diff is the patch that gets contributed back. An edit made "
    "in place does not break anything here, which is exactly why nothing else catches "
    "it.\n\n"
    "If the change is a MISTAKE -- a stray formatter run, an edit applied to the copy "
    "instead of to first-party code -- revert the file, and regenerate the manifest if it "
    "was regenerated over the edit.\n\n"
    "If the change is DELIBERATE, it is made UPSTREAM first and re-vendored (VENDOR.md, \"How "
    "to send a change back\"), then needs both halves in the SAME commit: regenerate the "
    "manifest with -DPACE_VENDOR_WRITE_MANIFEST=ON, which records each changed file's "
    "upstream hash, and add a row to VENDOR.md's \"Local changes\" table naming every such "
    "file in backticks, saying what and why and which upstream it goes to. Regenerating "
    "alone does not silence this check, and that is the point of it.\n\n"
    "A STALE DECLARATION means the change was upstreamed, reverted or never made: delete "
    "the row, or the path from it.\n\n"
    "This check says nothing about whether the tree still matches UPSTREAM beyond the "
    "hashes the manifest carries -- `=RESYNC` is trusted, not verified. Re-syncing is "
    "vendor/VENDOR.md's \"How to re-sync\", one root at a time.")

# `glob-traversals` must be SEEN to refuse, on each thing it claims and on nothing else.
#
# The rule it enforces is a PROXY (see the check's header), so the cases here are the
# difference between a guard that discriminates and one that merely runs. Two of them
# exist because the check got them wrong while it was being written, which is the best
# reason a case can have:
#
#   prose        the check reported its OWN remediation example, printed from inside a
#                `message()`. A call is a statement; matching the text anywhere on the
#                line makes a checker fail on its own documentation.
#   line-number  a stray `]` in a comment merges lines under CMake's list grouping, and
#                the check reported a call at line 217 that was at line 307. A guard
#                whose file:line is wrong sends the reader to the wrong place, which is
#                worse than silence because it looks like help.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check
# reports failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-glob-traversals-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

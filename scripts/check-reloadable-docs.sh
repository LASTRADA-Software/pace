# What the node's option table says RELOADS, and what the shipped artefacts claim.
#
# `OptionSpec::reloadable` decides whether a setting can change under SIGHUP. Two
# artefacts describe that set to operators and nothing derived either from the table:
# the docs' Reloadable/restart table, and the shipped reference configuration's count.
# It had already drifted -- hand-corrected from four to five to seven in one branch --
# and the population is growing rather than static (#403, #293, #404, #405 each added
# a row), so the drift rate rises with no signal (#1026).
#
# BOTH DIRECTIONS, and the second is the one that matters. A check written from the
# drift that was observed covers only "a new row, no artefact update", which costs a
# reader a stale doc. The operator failure is the other way: an artefact naming a
# setting as reloadable that the table says is NOT -- the operator edits the shipped
# file, sends SIGHUP, sees no error, and believes a setting is in force that is not.
#
# The artefact SET is derived by MARKER, never listed. A hand-kept list is exact about
# the files it knows and silent about the ones it does not, and silence reads
# identically to complete coverage (#492) -- that argument applies to a checker's own
# scope list as much as to its subject. So a third file adopting either marker is
# covered the day it does, and a file that drops one makes the scan match nothing,
# which is a REFUSAL: two empty lists agree perfectly.
#
# The stated count is PARSED from the table rather than compared to a number typed
# beside it (#780). It is spelled as an English WORD in the shipped file, so the
# numerals are a table here rather than a regex that would silently stop matching.
#
# A reference configuration's NAME list is covered too, when it states one. The count
# line may carry the settings after a colon -- `pace-kv.yaml` does, the node's states
# a count alone -- and those names are compared to the table both ways. #1070 made the
# COUNT derivable and left the five names beside it read by nothing, which is the same
# unchecked claim one field over.
#
# What this does NOT cover, narrowed to the fact it was drawn from: the node's reference
# configuration annotates individual settings "Reloadable" in a per-setting prose block,
# and THAT is not attached to a key in any machine-readable way. This paragraph used to
# say so of both files, which read as a general exemption for reference configurations
# and covered a comma-separated list on the very line the check already parses. The
# per-setting claim in the DOCS table is covered, and it is the one an operator reads
# first.
#
# bash 3.2: no mapfile, no `declare -A`, no `${var^^}` -- a hygiene script runs on
# every platform CI builds and macOS ships a 2007 bash. Sets are sorted newline lists
# compared with `comm`, which both platforms have.
#
# Invoke as `bash scripts/check-reloadable-docs.sh [<source-dir>]`, never bare:
# 15 of the scripts here are mode 644 in git and a bare call exits 126, which inside a
# want-fail assertion is indistinguishable from the rule firing (#723).
#
# **It checks EVERY binary in `SubjectTable` below, not just the node.** This was written
# for `pace-node` (#1026) and the daemon joined at
# [#1070](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1070), which is why the
# file and its two ctest entries lost their node-shaped names: a check whose name has
# stopped describing its subject is a defect here rather than cosmetics.
#
# **Two references to the old names are deliberately NOT renamed.**
# `.agent/rules/build-and-toolchain.md` cites `node-reloadable-docs` and
# `node-reloadable-docs-selftest` in its table of ways an instrument reported on a tree
# other than the one under test -- rows that quote what each check PRINTED under a
# specific broken environment, on a specific day. Those are dated measurements, and
# AGENT.md's rule is that a measurement's conditions are the world at one instant and must
# not be made to track their source; renaming them would re-attribute a real observation
# to a name that did not exist when it was taken. Every line this prints names its SUBJECT,
# so a reader of a failure is never in doubt about which binary it is talking about.

# carries the identical table header while describing `CliOptions()`, a different
# binary with a different set. A pattern is broader than its author reads it as, and
# this one matched two subjects as though they were one.
#
# So an artefact DECLARES its subject and the scope is derived from that declaration.
# A file with no marker is not in scope, which is the daemon snippet's honest state
# today; a file whose marker names a binary this check does not handle is REFUSED by
# name, so the gap cannot be filled silently by adding a marker somewhere.

# The truth: every YAML key whose option row is `Reloadable::Yes`.

# Walked row by row rather than matched flat. The association between a row's key and
# its reloadable column is the whole question, and a flat scan for `.yamlKey` -- which
# is what `check-node-config-reference.cmake` does for its own, different question --
# cannot express it.
#
# **A row ends where the next one BEGINS, and that is a correction rather than a
# tidy-up** ([#1070](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1070)). This
# used to terminate a row on `/^        },$/` -- a closing brace alone at eight spaces,
# which is how `NodeConfig.cpp` lays most of its rows out. `CliParser.cpp` uses the
# compact style, where the open brace shares the `.primary` line and the row closes with a
# trailing ` },` on its last field, so that pattern matches ZERO of its 48 rows -- `grep -c
# '\.primary = "' src/Pace/Config/CliParser.cpp`, the pattern stated because a census
# without one cannot be re-derived and drifts silently. Pointed at the daemon, the old walk
# returned an empty set, which `check_subject`'s "the option table yielded no
# Reloadable::Yes row" refuses -- correctly, and not for the reason a reader would have
# guessed. Named rather than cited by line number, which this very edit would have broken.
#
# It was also already wrong about the NODE, silently: `NodeConfig.cpp` MIXES the two
# styles (`:716` `{ .primary = "--config",` is compact), so a compact row there that went
# `Reloadable::Yes` would have been invisible to a check that reports a confident count.
# Nothing was wrong today, which is exactly why nobody would have found it.
#
# Keying on `.primary` instead needs no brace at all. **Two things that reads past, and
# both were found by planting them rather than by reading the rule.** A row keyed on a
# field spelling is only a row if the line is CODE and is INSIDE the table, and neither
# was being asked:
#
#   - A COMMENTED-OUT row is spelled exactly like a live one. `// { .primary = "--legacy",`
#     opened a row here, and its commented `.reloadable` line closed it, so a row somebody
#     had deliberately taken out of the build was reported as reloadable.
#   - `primary` stayed set from the LAST `.primary` line to EOF, so any `.yamlKey` or
#     `.reloadable` text after the table attached to that row. Prose quoting a row is the
#     ordinary way that happens, and `NodeConfig.cpp` has 2285 lines after its last row.
#     It does not merely ADD a key: it REPLACES the real one, so the last row of every
#     table is the one at risk.
#
# Both tails are clean today, which is why the walk answered correctly and why only a
# planted violation could find this -- the same reason the old terminator's defect was
# invisible. So the walk is bounded by the TABLE (`std::to_array<OptionSpec...>` to its
# `});`), and comment lines are not rows. `check_subject` requires that marker before
# walking, so a table that stops matching is a named refusal rather than an empty set.
#
# A fragment of `analyse`: `tableLine` is called for every line of an option table, and it
# emits `TRUTH <key>` per reloadable row and `OPENER yes` when the table carries the opener
# anywhere -- comments included, which is what the `grep -q` it replaces answered.

"""Prove every case in check-mutation-harness-selftest.py can FAIL, and that each
failure is THAT case and ONLY that case.

Deliberately NOT written with mutation-harness.py. Using the harness to prove the
harness would let a defect vouch for itself, and the subject here is the harness.
This is a plain matrix: neuter one guard in a COPY of the harness, run the whole
self-test against that copy, record which cases redden.

Each row states the cases it EXPECTS to redden. A row whose observed set differs
from its expected set is reported -- a mutation reddening MORE than its own case
is as much a finding as one reddening less, because it means the cases are not
independent and a future failure cannot be attributed.

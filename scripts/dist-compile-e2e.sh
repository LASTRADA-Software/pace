# End-to-end test of distributed compilation (POSIX). Starts a pace-kv cache and
# pace-node processes, and drives real compiles through pace-cc.
#
# EVERY NODE HERE IS SOLITARY. A zero-config node is a fleet of its own: it serves the
# scheduler, its own worker registers with it, and its scheduler leases that worker --
# so each node a case starts is ONE process that leases, verifies and compiles, and the
# client asks it directly. A second node cannot join a first over loopback, which is
# how these nodes bind, and that is production behaviour rather than a gap: a fleet is
# never offered at an address only this machine reaches. The properties that need two
# MACHINES are asserted in process,
# where an interleaving can be placed rather than hoped for -- each named at the case it
# came out of, and all of them listed in the report of the change that moved them:
# a lease landing on another machine and released to its issuer (`FleetLeaseRouting_test`),
# a learner verifying the grant its fleet's leader signed (`WorkerLease_test`), a worker
# refusing a caller its scheduler admitted (#235, `CompileResponder_test`), and a
# registration that proves the machine's key (`NodeProofResponder_test`).
#
# The properties asserted here are the ones no unit test can reach, because each
# needs real processes and a real compiler:
#
#   1. Byte-identical      — an object compiled on a WORKER equals the one this
#                            machine's compiler produces locally. This is the whole
#                            soundness claim of the feature in one assertion: every
#                            other property is worthless if this one does not hold,
#                            because a wrong object is stored under a key other
#                            machines then fetch.
#   2. Still a cache       — a dispatched compile STOREs, so the next identical
#                            compile is served from the cache and is NOT dispatched
#                            again. The client stores the worker's result, so a
#                            break here presents as a fleet that recompiles
#                            everything forever while looking healthy.
#  2b. Saved mid-dispatch  — a save landing after the key was taken and before the
#                            dispatch preprocess reads the source stores nothing:
#                            the worker compiled the SAVED content, and its object
#                            must never be filed under the key of the content the
#                            save replaced (#1650). Driven by `mid-compile-edit-stub`,
#                            which `--edit-stub` names; without it the case FAILS
#                            rather than skips.
#   3. Fingerprint isolate — a worker whose toolchain fingerprint differs is NEVER
#                            dispatched to, even when it is the only worker
#                            registered. An over-loose match does not fail, it
#                            produces an object built by the wrong compiler under a
#                            key that claims otherwise.
#   4. Failover            — with every worker dead, the build still succeeds
#                            locally. Distribution must be incapable of failing a
#                            build; this is the property that lets it be switched on
#                            by default in a fleet where nodes come and go.
#   5. Role gate           — pointing a client's scheduler at the CACHE listener is
#                            refused with a typed reply and falls back to a local
#                            compile, rather than hanging or serving.
#   6. Concurrency         — more concurrent clients than the fleet has slots must
#                            still all succeed, with correct objects and no hang.
#                            See the case for why it does not assert WHICH ones were
#                            refused.
#   7. Language             — a `.c` source compiled by a C++ driver comes back
#                            compiled as C++, because that is what this driver does
#                            with it locally. The client states the language when it
#                            hands over preprocessed text, and taking that from the
#                            extension alone is wrong for exactly this shape — a
#                            wrong object rather than a failed one.
#  7b. Root-bound           — a dispatched object naming its checkout (the builtin
#                            `source_location` is made of) is not served into a second
#                            checkout, and is served back to the first. The worker
#                            compiles text whose line markers name the CLIENT's paths,
#                            so the object names the client's checkout and no key sees
#                            it; the launcher scans a dispatched object as it scans a
#                            local one. The Windows fixture's case 3b is its twin.
#   8. Graceful stop        — a worker asked to stop does, promptly, rather than
#                            waiting for a supervisor to escalate.
#  12. Cache independence   — a cache the launcher cannot reach does not stop the
#                            compile being dispatched. The cache and the scheduler
#                            are separate services on separate machines, so a
#                            failure of one is not a failure of the other; joining
#                            them turned a mistyped PACE_ADDR into a
#                            fleet-wide outage behind an entirely green build.
#
# Cases 9 to 11 — the node's own cache tier, a worker that sizes itself, and a
# black-holed upstream — carry their reasoning at the case rather than here,
# because each is about a node's internals rather than about the client contract
# this list describes.
#
# Ports are allocated per run rather than fixed. This fixture needs four of them
# (cache, dispatch, and two workers), and four more fixed ports is four more ways
# for a CI runner shared with the other smoke tests to collide — a failure that
# reads as "distribution is broken" when it means "something else was listening".
#
# Every case is loopback end to end. Who a worker admits from ANOTHER
# address is not asked here: `FleetTickets_test` and `FrameEndpoint_test` ask it in
# process, over a real endpoint whose peer reports a non-loopback host (#235).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The pure verdict decisions, and the self-test that drives them.
#
# Hoisted above the prerequisite gate ON PURPOSE. Everything in this block is a
# function of its arguments -- no process, no port, no compiler, no filesystem --
# so `--self-test` reaches it on a machine with none of the three binaries built,
# which is the population a self-test is for. Requiring them would make the one
# check that needs no build the one check that cannot run without one, which is
# the reasoning `dist-compile-e2e.ps1` records for its own `-SelfTest`.
#
# WHAT THIS FIXTURE'S SELF-TEST COVERS IS NOT WHAT THE POWERSHELL ONE COVERS, and
# #597 asked for the same decisions on both. They cannot be the same: the Windows
# fixture decides whether two COFF objects are equivalent, excusing named sections
# and a timestamp, and this one reads DWARF attributes out of whichever of three
# readers a host has. Two object formats, two grammars, two different decisions --
# so a correspondence by DECISION is a claim neither file could keep, and one
# asserted anyway would be a name for coverage that does not exist. What IS kept is
# the property worth having: each fixture's own verdict arithmetic is driven over
# synthetic input by a check that needs no build. Said here rather than assumed.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Whether a reader's output is a DWARF dump at all, rather than merely output.
#
# "Wrote something to stdout" is a different question: libdwarf's `dwarfdump` takes
# `-i`, not `--debug-info`, and a reader that answers an unknown option with usage
# text ON STDOUT would be classified as having read the object -- which turns the
# SKIPPED state into a failure of the SUBJECT, the exact collapse the reader
# selection exists to prevent. So the dump must name a compile unit, in one of the
# three renderings. Exit status is not enough on its own: a reader can exit 0 having
# printed a banner.

# can be driven with no reader installed (#597).

    #
    # SIGTERM first, then SIGKILL after a grace period -- never a bare `wait`.
    # These processes handle SIGTERM, so a bug that stops one from finishing its
    # shutdown would hang cleanup forever, and cleanup runs on EVERY exit path
    # including the failing ones. That turns "one assertion failed" into "the
    # suite timed out with no output", which is how this fixture's own first
    # version reported a real worker-shutdown bug: ***Timeout 900.10 sec, in
    # three CI jobs, naming nothing.

    # The SET is `jobs -pr` and no longer a `pids` array the spawn sites appended
    # to (#845). Every one of those appends was correct; that is the point rather
    # than a reprieve, because correctness maintained by memory is a defect with
    # a delay and nothing made a missing `pids+=` fail. Deleting the ledger
    # outright is what makes the omission impossible rather than fixable -- and
    # #451 folding the spawns into `start_node`/`start_daemon` did not do it, it
    # only moved the forgettable line from ten sites to two.
    #
    # Checked rather than assumed, since `jobs -pr` cannot see a process started
    # INSIDE a `( ... )`: every long-lived spawn is in this shell -- directly,
    # inside a top-level `if`, or in `start_node`/`start_daemon`, which are
    # functions called from the top level -- and the `( ... ) &` sites background
    # the SUBSHELL, which is itself a job of this shell. None starts a grandchild.
    #
    # It now also reaps the launcher subshells `cap_pids` and the case 11 pair
    # hold, which the ledger never covered. On the happy path they have been
    # waited for and are gone; on a `fail` between the spawn and the `wait` they

#
# This file kept its own seven, and it is the file the duplication had already
# cost something in: three of its waits once matched the bare word `registered`,
# which `0 of 1 toolchain(s) registered` matches too, so they returned for a
# worker the scheduler had turned away. #445 corrected those into a
# `wait_for_registration` -- and a corrected wait sitting in one fixture is the
# cause reproduced while the instance is fixed, so it is the LIBRARY's now.
#
# Two behavioural differences travel in with the shared versions and both are
# fixes this file wanted:
#
#   * `fail` raised inside `$( ... )` stops the RUN. The copy that lived here
#     called `exit 1`, which ends the command substitution's subshell only --
#     and `free_port` and `wait_for_counter` were both called that way, so a
#     drawn-port exhaustion or a counter that never moved stopped the script
#     only because `set -e` happened to notice the assignment's status.
#     `wait_for_counter` is no longer called that way at all (#643): it sets
#     `E2eCounterReading`, so the subshell is gone rather than made survivable.
#   * `http_get` keeps a final chunk with no trailing newline. `read` returns
#     non-zero on one, so the copy here dropped it; that is latent only because
#     the endpoints this file reads happen to end in a newline, and
#     `fleet-dashboard-e2e`'s copy had already been bitten by it.

# How long a bounded wait in this fixture may take.
#
# 30 seconds, and the number is chosen to be no STRICTER than what this file has
# been running under rather than to be a fresh measurement. Every wait here was
# `for _ in $(seq 1 100); do ...; sleep 0.2; done`: a hundred polls of a fifth of
# a second each, which is at least 20 s and is more than that on a machine too
# loaded to poll at the assumed rate -- exactly the reading `_e2e_verdict` now
# prints as `the loop overran its own budget`. A clock bound of 20 would
# therefore be a tightening, and tightening a bound is not part of a conversion;
# 30 keeps the intended twenty with room for the polling overhead the old loop
# allowed silently.
#
# It is deliberately not `fleet-dashboard-e2e`'s 240. That fixture pays for a
# cold include-tree walk before its node binds; here the walk is already warm by
# the time any node starts, because `--print-toolchain-fingerprint` below walks
# the same tree first.
#
# IT IS THE ONLY BUDGET IN THIS FIXTURE, and it was not until #643. The counter
# wait kept a hand-written loop with its own `seconds=10`, so an operator raising
# this number -- the documented remedy for a slow box -- scaled every wait here
# except the one a slow box lengthens most: the others wait for a process to bind,
# that one waits for a COMPILE to finish and a counter to rise. It failed at the
# one place the remedy did not reach, and said the worker never got there, which
# is true and points at the worker rather than at the budget.
#
# It was not simply converted at the time because `wait_until` cannot say its
# three terminal states. That is what the library's findings hook is for, so the
# triage survived the conversion rather than being traded for the budget.

# What every worker this fixture starts is told its drain may take, and what every
# wait for one to stop is bounded by. ONE number, which is the whole of #380.
#
# The bound was 15 s while the node's own default drain is 30 s, so the fixture's
# ceiling was HALF the process's configured maximum: a worker that drained for 20 s
# and then exited was behaving exactly as configured and this fixture called it a
# failure. It was also not the EXPECTED time -- a worker signalled with nothing in
# flight wakes its accept loop and stops in well under a second -- so 15 sat between
# the two numbers that mean something, catching neither case cleanly and deciding
# itself on how loaded the runner was. It ejected #378 from the merge queue on a base
# that had passed the same leg, and it failed #418, a change that removes a dead
# config field.
#
# So the fixture STATES the drain rather than inheriting it. Every worker is started
# with `--drain-timeout`, and the wait is that number plus a margin for the runner.
# The contradiction is gone because both halves now read the same variable, and the
# assertion is STRICTER than before rather than looser: ten seconds against a
# sub-second expectation, where the old bound allowed fifteen and disagreed with the
# process about what was legal.
#
# Raising the bound to 30 to stop this recurring is the one thing that must not
# happen: it widens the window in which a genuinely wedged worker still passes, which
# is exactly what `stop_and_require_exit` exists to catch.

# own. `fail` inside such a substitution ends the run correctly and would still
# hand the caller an empty pid on the way past.
#
# Since #845 that argument is STRONGER rather than weaker. Cleanup reaps

# Start one compile node, and wait for it to be SERVING.
#
# THE recipe this fixture inlined at ten sites (#451). What was actually repeated
# is not the flags -- those are what each case is ABOUT and they stay at the call
# sites -- but the lines around them: name a log under `$workdir`, background the
# process, capture `$!`, and wait for the port with the right host and the right
# log. Every one of those is a place a copy can be silently short, and two of them
# already were: a node whose pid never reached the old `pids` ledger was a worker
# still holding its port after the run, and a wait given the wrong log dumps a
# file that explains nothing.
#
# The ledger line is gone (#845) and its failure mode with it: cleanup reaps
# `jobs -pr`, so there is no append for a new spawn site to omit. Folding the
# recipe here did not close that -- it moved the forgettable line from ten sites
# to one, which is fewer places to forget rather than none.
#
# The invariant flags are the three no case varies: the drain this fixture states
# rather than inherits (#380), and the bind, which is also what is advertised -- a node
# that advertised something else would be describing an endpoint the lease signature
# then covers and no client can reach. What makes every dispatch here a SIGNED and
# CHECKED one (#282) is that every node runs consensus: its worker checks each grant
# against the state that consensus applies.
#
# Everything else is a flag the caller passes, INCLUDING the cache tier and the log
# level. Neither gets a default here, because a default plus an override is the
# same flag twice and which one wins is then the option table's overwrite order --
# a fixture asserting a property it never states. `--cache-memory=0` in particular
# is what turns a tier OFF, so a node that silently kept one would race for
# `pace-cc`'s default port with every other node in the run.
#
# BOUND IS NOT READY, which is why this waits through `wait_for_node_ready`
# rather than `wait_for_port` (#451, #634). The full account -- what the window
# is, why the old loop hid it, and what the second wait establishes -- is in the
# library beside the helper, and is deliberately not restated here: three copies
# of one story had already drifted apart on who removed the accidental delay
# before anyone noticed they were the same story.
#
# What is local to this file: case 8 was measured falling into the window, and
# the fix is HERE rather than at that case because a first failure masks its
# identical siblings -- case 9's `tier-node` and case 11's `blackhole-node` are
# compiled against immediately after their bind and had exactly the same hole, so
# fixing only the observed site relocates a flake rather than removing it. The
# marker is one unconditional line every node logs, the scheduler tier included,
# so there is no node this can hang on.
#
# Registration is NOT part of it: some nodes are started to hold a port and a

# Start one `pace-kv` daemon, and wait for it to be ACCEPTING.

# `start_node`'s counterpart, and it exists for the same reason one ticket later
# (#644). The node recipe reached twelve copies before #451 folded it; the DAEMON
# recipe was still written out five times, each repeating its own
# `> "${workdir}/<tag>.log" 2>&1 &`, its own `$!`, its own ledger append and its
# own wait -- and each free to spell the tag one way and the log another. The
# append is gone outright since #845; the rest is why this function still exists. That is the
# mapping a reader needs when a run fails: the failure names a daemon, the
# evidence is in a file, and nothing connects the two if the two are typed
# separately. Here the TAG is both, exactly as `start_node` documents for itself.
#
# The five copies had already drifted in the smaller way: the message each wait
# printed was a phrase of its own (`membership daemon`, `isolation daemon`, `tier
# upstream`) while the log was named something else, so `cat`ing the right file
# after a failure meant knowing the mapping. There is now one name.
#
# IT WAITS FOR ACCEPTING, NOT FOR THE BIND, and that is the one behavioural change
# rather than a fold. All five copies used `wait_for_port`, which returns for a
# socket that is bound with nobody accepting on it -- the connect lands in the
# backlog and answers the probe. `Core/ReadinessMarker.hpp` puts the daemon's
# `ready, accepting connections` strictly after the last acceptor arms, and the
# very next thing every one of these call sites does is point a launcher at that
# port. #634 is the same hole in the node's half of this file, found only after it
# had been open for months, and building the weaker recipe here knowing that is
# how it gets inherited.
#
# `--listen` is the invariant, because every daemon here binds one address and
# that address is what the caller then probes. Everything else is the caller's,
# including the log level: a default plus an override is the same flag twice, and
# which wins is then the option table's overwrite order.
#
# THE READINESS LINE IS `Info`, so a caller that passes `--log-level=warn` gets a
# daemon that never writes the marker and a wait that spends its whole budget. The
# failure names the marker and dumps the log, so it is diagnosable rather than
# silent -- but it is a trap, and `Info` is the config default, so the flag can

# The Prometheus grammar, the one-scrape read and the counter wait are the

# `wait_for_counter` hands its reading back in `E2eCounterReading` rather than on

# is one. With the slots AT the core count it fell to zero on any host with no idle core,
# and a host running other builds beside this suite is exactly that: the worker withdrew
# `external-cpu`, and case 12 -- whose subject is an unreachable CACHE -- ended as a skip or a

# that is simultaneously doing its job -- it runs on its own thread beside the
# accept loop, and "it constructs" and "it answers while the worker is busy" are
# different claims.
#
# THAT IS AN ARGUMENT FOR THE `http_get` BELOW AND NOT FOR A `wait_for_port`, and
# one stood here carrying it (#655). A port wait establishes a BIND. What
# establishes "it answers while the worker is busy" is a request that gets a `200`
# back, which is the next line.
#
# The wait could not have failed either. `main.cpp` binds this surface
# synchronously in `StartAdminSurfaceOrExplain`, about four hundred lines before
# it logs `compile node ready`, and a bind that fails is `return ExitUsage` -- so
# the marker `start_node` waits on since #634 is unreachable without it, and the
# `wait_for_registration` above is a heartbeat round later still. Its deletion
# also improves the failure it looked like it guarded: an admin port this node
# could not bind is a DEATH inside `start_node`, with the log and the exit status,
# rather than a spent budget reporting that a healthy process never listened.
#
# Recorded at this length because deleting the wait WITHOUT reading the comment
# would look like the claim went with it, and the next reader might restore the
# wait or -- worse -- delete the `http_get` as the apparently redundant one.

# markers, for the worker. A save landing between the two hands the worker the SAVED

# below that restores the original content and builds it again was a HIT serving the

# and every checkout holding the original content fetching it. That is what this case
# discriminates.

# shape: the worker handles SIGTERM, so the signal no longer kills it outright --
# if the accept loop cannot then be woken, the process hangs and `systemctl stop`
# waits out its timeout before escalating to SIGKILL. It needs a real socket to
# catch, because the mechanism IS the socket: POSIX does not unblock a parked
# accept() when the listener is closed, so the loop only comes back through the
# SO_RCVTIMEO poll. macOS wakes the accept anyway and hides the whole thing, which
# is why this is asserted here and not left to a developer machine.
#
# Its fingerprint is PINNED and unique, like every other single-purpose worker here,
# and that is not cosmetic. It is a node of its own now, registering with its own
# scheduler, so its corpse is leasable by nobody -- but the reasoning below is why it
# was pinned when it registered with the shared one, and it is kept for the day a
# worker here joins a scheduler it does not run. A worker is deliberately
# killed -- and a scheduler only learns a worker is gone when its
# heartbeat lapses, which is by design: a polite goodbye would be a second path to
# "this worker is alive", exercised on exactly the shutdowns that are already
# harmless and never on the crash that matters (the reasoning is at the end of
# `WorkerBody`). So for the rest of the heartbeat window this endpoint is still
# leasable.
#
# On the DEFAULT fingerprint that made this corpse a candidate for case 12, which
# asks the same scheduler for the same toolchain the launcher uses. The scheduler
# hands out the dead endpoint, the dispatch fails at the transport, the client
# correctly falls back to a local compile -- and case 12, which asserts DISPATCHED,
# fails for a reason that has nothing to do with what it guards. Seen twice on
# macOS, once ejecting a pull request from the merge queue (#427).
#
# Pinning removes the overlap rather than papering over it: nothing leases
# `graceful-stop-only`, so a corpse under that name is inert. Loosening case 12 to
# accept a local fallback would have deleted the #236 assertion it exists for.
#
# And it holds a private cache tier and names no `--upstream`, which is the DEFAULT
# shape of a node -- the one shape whose stop can crash AFTER it looks graceful. Such a
# node reads through to the fleet's shared cache, and when that is this machine's own
# tier it reads it in process, borrowing the host `main` declares first so it is
# destroyed last. Reverse the two and `~SharedCacheHost` aborts at every stop, after

# serialized -- so one upstream that never responded held every local
# `pace-cc` behind it for the full per-operation ceiling, one after another.
# A node with an unreachable shared cache had an unusable port of its own.
#
# 192.0.2.1 is RFC 5737 documentation space: it BLACK-HOLES rather than refusing,

# What is ASSERTED here is correctness -- both objects are produced, and the node
# survives an upstream that never answers -- and the elapsed time is only REPORTED.
# That split is deliberate. Measured, two concurrent clients take ~3s and two
# serialized ones would take ~4s: the gap is one connect ceiling, which is thinner
# than the variance of a shared CI runner, so a threshold there would be a test that
# fails for reasons about the machine. This repository has already paid for that
# class of failure.
#
# The concurrency itself is proven deterministically instead, by
# `FrameEndpoint_test`'s held-answer case -- which was verified by serving inline
# again and watching only it fail. What this case adds is the integration: a real

# #203 made a local object relocatable by appending `-fdebug-prefix-map` rules, and
# `RemoteCompileArgs` drops every path-valued flag -- so a worker received no
# mapping and a fleet-built object recorded a directory a locally mapped one does
# not, under the same key.
#
# **Read, never compared.** The ticket says so and it is the load-bearing half: two
# different-but-checkout-independent mappings compare EQUAL across checkouts, which
# is exactly how #203's own rule-order defect first read green. Case 1 above is the
# byte comparison; this one is the only assertion in the fixture that opens the
# debug records and looks.
#
# **The launcher is run from a directory the worker is not in**, and that is the
# whole arrangement. The node was started with no directory of its own, so it
# inherits this fixture's -- and a case that compiled here too would produce
# agreeing objects with the fix reverted, which is a case that passes under the bug.
#
# **And it is run twice, once through a symlink**, which is not a variation but the
# case that fails. Both drivers report and prefix-match `$PWD` when it names the
# same directory as `.`, while `current_path()` is getcwd(3) and resolves every
# link -- so a build reached through a symlink puts a rule on the line that the
# resolved spelling does not match, the launcher concludes that a build which maps
# perfectly well maps nothing, and the dispatched object keeps the WORKER's
# directory. That is #506 surviving its own fix, and it reached master green:
# macOS's `/var` is a symlink so `$TMPDIR` is under one, Linux's `/tmp` is not, and

    #
    # clang takes `DW_AT_name` from the input file path, so before #660 a dispatched
    # object recorded the worker's per-job scratch -- `<scratch>/job-N/tu.cpp`, a
    # directory on no developer's machine, and one whose counter advances between two
    # dispatches of the same translation unit, giving two byte-differing objects under
    # one cache key. gcc takes it from the `#line` marker and already agreed, which is
    # why this must not be read as covering both drivers equally: on gcc it is a
    # regression guard, on clang it is the ticket.
    #
    # **What this case does NOT cover**, stated because the arrangement hides it: the
    # source lives at `${proj}/thirteen-<label>.cpp` while the mapped directory is
    # `${proj}/build/mapcase`, so the source is OUTSIDE the mapped root and the
    # reference compile's own `-fdebug-prefix-map` never matches it. Both sides
    # therefore record the same raw absolute path and agree. A build whose source lies
    # UNDER a mapped root -- which is what `_pace_debug_prefix_map_rules` produces for an
    # in-tree build -- is the arrangement #800 is about, and this case cannot see it.
    #
    # Since #800 the launcher sends what its OWN compile would record: the source
    # argument put through the line's own prefix-map rules. Measured on clang 22.1.8,
    # that makes the dispatched `DW_AT_name` byte-identical to the local one where it
    # used to be the raw absolute path. **It does not reach gcc**, whose `DW_AT_name`
    # comes from the `#line` marker rather than from the input path -- measured on gcc
    # 16.2.1, the dispatched name is the client's raw absolute path under BOTH
    # spellings, and neither driver rewrites a marker for this flag. Closing that half
    # needs the client's own source-root mapping on the wire, which the payload's exact
    # arity makes a version bump.
    #
    # That half is closed by #883's source-root pair, and **case 14 below is where it
    # is asserted** -- not here. This case's arrangement is unchanged on purpose: its
    # source lies outside every mapped root, so the two objects agree for a reason that
    # has nothing to do with either ticket, which makes it a regression guard on both
    # drivers and the ticket for neither. Case 14 builds the arrangement that can fail.

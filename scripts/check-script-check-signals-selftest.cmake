# `script-check-signals` is watched refusing, against synthesised trees.
#
# ## Why this exists at all, and why it arrives with #680
#
# That check has run green since #497 and had never been seen to REFUSE anything.
# A guard nobody has watched refuse is not a guard -- the same argument
# `script-check-canary` makes for the FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION mechanism, one
# level up and applied to the check's own rules rather than to ctest's plumbing.
#
# #680 widened pass 3 to the two CPack hook scripts, which no ctest registration
# names, and that widening is exactly the kind of change whose failure mode is
# silence: a scan that stops matching reports the same "all clear" as one that
# matched everything. Two empty lists agree perfectly.
#
# ## What it drives, and why these four
#
# One control that must PASS, then four defects that must each be refused with
# ONE finding attributed to the right file, then the control AGAIN over the same
# tree -- see `pace_stage_tree` for why there is one tree and what the
# closing control is for:
#
#   strip       a hook loses its `cmake_minimum_required` -- the rule itself
#   rename      the hook VARIABLE is renamed, so the scan matches nothing
#   repoint     the hook variable names a script that is not there
#   semicolon   the hook path contains a `;`
#
# `rename` is the one that matters most and is the least obvious: it is the arm
# that fails CLOSED. Without it a renamed `CPACK_*_BUILD_SCRIPTS` would take the
# whole pass quietly out of service and the check would go on reporting success.
#
# `semicolon` is here because this check found the defect in ITSELF. CMake splits
# a `;` inside a `list(APPEND)` argument into two elements, so a single violation
# printed as two lines and was COUNTED as two -- a check miscounting its own
# output, caught only because an arm reported a number nobody could explain. The
# finding COUNT is therefore asserted, not just the presence of a refusal.
#
# ## The verdict is read from the OUTPUT
#
# This script is registered with FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION like every other, so it
# is subject to the rule it tests -- the same position
# `check-script-check-signals.cmake` takes about itself.
#
# NOT for the reason that was written here first. "message(FATAL_ERROR) in script
# mode exits 0 on CMake 3.28" was the stated ground for the whole mechanism and
# **it does not reproduce** -- #565 measured exit 1 on 3.22.6, 3.25.2, 3.27.9,
# 3.28.3, 3.31.6 and 4.3.0. The property stays because two OTHER things are true
# and were never the stated reason: `message(WARNING)` exits 0 on every version
# while printing `CMake Warning`, which only an output verdict can hear (#517),
# and a script that shells out to another CMake without reading RESULT_VARIABLE
# exits 0 while its child's error is on the output.
#
# That second reason is this file exactly: it runs the check under test through
# `execute_process` and reads the OUTPUT for `CMake Error`. Its own exit status
# says nothing about what it found, which is why the registration cannot rely on
# one -- so the corrected reason is not merely more accurate here, it is the one
# that actually applies.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DPACE_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-script-check-signals-selftest.cmake

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.28)

# CMP0219 -- "macro invocations preserve backslashes in arguments" -- exists only
# on newer CMake than this file's declared minimum, so it is set behind
# `if(POLICY ...)`. Unset, a macro called with an argument containing a backslash
# emits a POLICY WARNING, and `PACE_SCRIPT_CHECK_FAILED` matches
# `CMake Warning` deliberately (#517: a check that warns is a check nobody reads).
# So the warning alone takes this test red on the platform whose CMake has the
# policy -- measured on `macOS-clang-release`, where all five cases reported
# `every verdict as expected` and ctest failed it anyway.
#
# The policy is belt to the braces below. The real fix was to stop passing a
# FILE'S CONTENTS through a macro at all; this covers the arguments that remain
# (a scratch path, which carries backslashes on Windows) and documents the hazard
# where the next reader will meet it.

#
# ONE tree for every case, mutated and restored, rather than one copy per case
# (#1137). The copy is 158 files, and on a Windows checkout reached over DrvFs it
# is what this test COSTS: five copies were 81% of a 63 s run, against 8% for the
# five nested `cmake -P` invocations the ticket's hypothesis named. Measured
# 2026-09-10 on WSL2 / Ubuntu-24.04 / 32 CPUs, load average 0.08 at the start,
# min of three, timed with CLOCK_MONOTONIC because CLOCK_REALTIME is stepped in
# both directions on that host:
#
#   whole selftest, five copies    DrvFs 63.26 s     ext4  3.01 s
#   ONE staging (file COPY x158)   DrvFs 10.24 s     ext4  0.01 s

# host at one instant and must not silently start describing a different one.
#
# What one tree costs is that a case which fails to restore leaves the next case
# reading a tree nobody described. Two independent guards, because the restore is
# the whole risk: every case asserts its own file came back byte-identical, and
# the control is run AGAIN at the end over the same tree -- which is strictly
# more than the per-copy arrangement could say, since that one never checked that

# Each injection is followed by `if(before STREQUAL after)` written out rather
# than wrapped in a helper, and that is deliberate. `if(x STREQUAL y)` with bare
# variable NAMES compares their values without expanding either into an argument
# list -- so a file's contents never become arguments, which is what made the
# first version of this file emit a CMP0219 policy warning and go red on macOS
# with all five verdicts correct. Four short `if` blocks are the price of a
# construct that cannot reintroduce it.
#
# The assertion itself is not optional: an edit that matches no anchor changes
# nothing and reports success, and this file was already bitten by the
# neighbouring failure -- an anchor that matched and landed in a structurally
# invalid position -- which is why the arms assert the finding COUNT too.

# The RESTORE carries an assertion of its own, and for a different reason than
# the injection's. An injection that changes nothing stages no defect and the

# reading a tree the file does not describe, and its verdict then belongs to no
# stated arrangement. Both are read back with bare variable NAMES -- `if(a

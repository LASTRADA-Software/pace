# Refuse a shipping ELF binary that links a library this project VENDORS as a shared
# object (#1538).
#
# ## The defect this exists for
#
# `CMakeLists.txt` sets `CPM_USE_LOCAL_PACKAGES ON` and asks CPM for yaml-cpp with
# `YAML_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF`. Those two do not compose: with local packages preferred,
# CPM runs `find_package(yaml-cpp)` FIRST, and on a runner where `libyaml-cpp-dev` is
# installed that succeeds -- so the option naming a static build is never read by
# anything and the binary links `libyaml-cpp.so.0.8`.
#
# For the `.deb` and the `.rpm` that is survivable: `CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS` and
# `CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_AUTOREQ` derive a dependency on the runtime package. The TGZ carries
# no dependency metadata at ALL, and the TGZ is what `FASTCACHE_AUTO_INSTALL` unpacks
# onto a developer's machine. There the daemon dies in the dynamic loader with
# `error while loading shared libraries: libyaml-cpp.so.0.8` and exit 127, which the
# configure reported as `pace-kv exited immediately (127)` -- a number that reads as
# *not found* for a binary CMake has just staged and knows the path of.
#
# The `Package (macOS .pkg)` job already passes `-DCPM_USE_LOCAL_PACKAGES=OFF` and says
# why in its own comment. The Linux one did not, and nothing was watching, which is what
# this is.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, stated rather than omitted
#
# Only the libraries this project VENDORS -- the ones a `find_package` hijack turns from
# a static archive into a runtime dependency nobody declared. A GENUINE system library
# (libc, libstdc++, libssl, libcrypto) is a legitimate `NEEDED` entry here and is not
# examined: whether those may be dynamic is a packaging policy question about the whole
# distribution channel, not this defect, and an over-broad rule would refuse every
# correct build. So a clean run says *no vendored library is dynamic*, and it does NOT
# say *this binary is self-contained*.
#
# ELF only. The macOS `.pkg` job closes the same hole through its configure flag, and
# Windows has no shared yaml-cpp in play.
#
# ## Three outcomes, because a reader that could not read is not a clean reading
#
#   0  clean            every binary was read, every one yielded NEEDED entries, and none
#                       of them names a vendored library
#   1  refused          a binary names a vendored library as a runtime dependency
#   2  did not conclude no binary-inspection tool, no binaries at the path, or a binary
#                       whose NEEDED list came back EMPTY -- which is the reader failing,
#                       not a statically linked program: every dynamically linked ELF
#                       here needs at least libc. That is the positive control, and
#                       without it a reader that prints nothing at all reports clean.
#
# A run can produce both of the last two, and then 1 wins: a refusal is a finding about
# the artefact that names the library and the remedy, while 2 sends the reader to the
# instrument instead. Reported the other way round, one unreadable file turns a real
# violation into a question about the tool.
#

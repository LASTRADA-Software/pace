# The measurement behind `check-tidy-blind-spots.sh`: which translation units in a
# compile database contributed nothing, asked of the OBJECTS rather than the source.
#
# A separate file rather than a heredoc inside the shell script, and that is not a
# style choice: bash 3.2 -- which macOS still ships, and which `FASTCACHED_BASH`
# resolves to there -- cannot parse a here-document inside a command substitution.
# It fails at PARSE time with "unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote", so
# the whole check dies before running and every selftest case refuses for a reason
# that has nothing to do with what it tests.
#
# Reads NM_BIN, DB and REPO from the environment. Prints one path per blind unit on
# stdout; diagnostics prefixed `!ERROR` on stderr with exit 2.

    the vendor-sanitized control, is `-fno-sanitize=all` ON PURPOSE -- defines exactly its
    own code, and one small function is 1 symbol: scored, it read as blind while clang-tidy
    reads its source like any other. Order matters because target options follow the
    directory-scoped `-fsanitize=address`, and a later `-fsanitize=` turns it back on.

    The exemption is THE COMPILE LINE DISABLED THE SANITIZER, read from the command, and
    nothing else. It is not "objects with few symbols": an instrumented object with one
    symbol is exactly what the signature exists to call blind, and it still is.

# End-to-end fixture for `pacectl` against a real `pace-kv`.
#
# What the unit tests cannot reach, and therefore what this is for:
#
#   * **The exit codes, against a live server.** A cache miss must exit 1 and an
#     unreachable daemon must exit 3. That discrimination is the whole reason the
#     outcome table has six rows rather than two, and a scripted exchange can only
#     prove the mapping -- not that the real refusals arrive as the right kind.
#   * **The stats ladder's rungs.** `/metrics` and `INFO` are on different ports and
#     answer with wildly different amounts. Which one wins, and whether the loser is
#     reported as *not asked* rather than *did not answer*, is a property of two real
#     listeners.
#   * **`--raw` byte fidelity**, which on Windows depends on stdout being switched out
#     of text mode. A value containing a newline is corrupted otherwise, on exactly
#     one platform.
#   * **The authentication gate**, whose interesting arm needs a daemon configured to
#     demand a credential.
#   * **A real `pace-node`**, which speaks the `0xFC` wire and NOTHING
#     else. No scripted exchange can establish what that binary does to a RESP client,
#     and what it does is the whole reason the node verbs exist: it closes having sent
#     nothing. Cases 11-13 are that.

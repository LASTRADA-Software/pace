# Only the files in `FastCachedUdpOpenerUnits` below open a UDP socket: discovery's, in
# `src/apps/pace-node/DiscoveryTier.cpp`, the one socket that RECEIVES; and the route
# probe's, in `src/Pace/Platform/RouteProbe.cpp`, which only `connect()`s to read the kernel's
# source-address choice, sends and receives nothing, and is closed at once.
#
# ## Why this is a rule
#
# `--install-service` gives the compile node a Windows Firewall rule for discovery's reply socket.
# Unless `--discovery-reply-port` pins it, the kernel chooses that socket's port at every start, so
# no port-scoped rule can name it, and the rule admits EVERY local UDP port (`... discovery-reply
# udp/any`), scoped to the program and its service. What that rule exposes is therefore every UDP
# socket this program opens. The documentation, the rulebook and `NodeFirewallRules` all say that
# exposes discovery and nothing that listens besides -- true only while discovery's are the only UDP
# sockets that receive. A socket that did would be reachable from the network through a rule written
# for somebody else, and nothing about a green build would say so; the route probe's row is permitted
# because its socket never reads.
#
# ## What is scanned, and what counts as opening a UDP socket
#
# First-party C++, DERIVED rather than listed: `fastcached_first_party_cxx`, which is every tracked
# C++ source (`git ls-files`, or a directory walk where there is no index) minus the third-party
# roots. Tests are not scanned -- `*_test.cpp` and `src/tests/` open sockets of their own to test
# with, and no service registers them -- and neither is anything declined as third-party.
#
# An opener is a USE, in code with comments stripped (`fastcached_scan_code_lines`), of one of the
# primitives below: core-cpp's three UDP factories, or a raw `SOCK_DGRAM` / `IPPROTO_UDP` for a
# socket made without them. Each row carries its reason, and a needle nobody can argue with is a
# needle nobody reads.
#
# ## The permitted row is the positive control
#
# The permitted file must EXIST, be ENUMERATED, and be SEEN opening a UDP socket. A row that has
# stopped doing any of the three is refused as stale: that is what a renamed primitive or a moved
# opener looks like, after which this check would go on passing while guarding nothing.
#
# NOT covered, and the direction it fails in is PERMISSIVE: a UDP socket opened through a primitive
# this table does not name (a factory core-cpp adds later, or a platform call spelling neither
# `SOCK_DGRAM` nor `IPPROTO_UDP`), or through a macro. And **sockets a dependency opens inside
# this process are not scanned**: only first-party source is read, so a UDP socket core-cpp, a
# resolver, or a TLS or telemetry library opens on the program's behalf is exposed by the any-port
# rule exactly as a first-party one would be, and this check says nothing about it -- SILENT, and
# therefore OPEN. What is known about core-cpp itself, read from the pinned source rather than
# assumed: its datagram socket is created in `detail::makeDatagramSocket`, reached only from the
# open path behind `openUdpSocket` (and `detail::openUdpSocketWithReceiveBuffer`, and
# `openSharedPortUdpSocket`, which calls `openUdpSocket` twice) -- every one of which this scan
# catches at the first-party call site. A core-cpp that later opens a UDP socket of its own, for
# a resolver say, would not be seen here.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check reports failure
# through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> [-DGIT_EXECUTABLE=<git>] -P scripts/check-udp-opener.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.

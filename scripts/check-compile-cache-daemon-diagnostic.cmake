# Assert that when FASTCACHE_AUTO_START's daemon dies on startup, the configure says
# WHY and not merely with what number ([#1538](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/1538)).
#
# ## What went wrong
#
# `_fc_auto_start_fastcached` spawned the staged daemon under `OUTPUT_QUIET ERROR_QUIET`
# and reported `pace-kv exited immediately (${_rc})`. The commonest failure there is a
# dynamic loader that cannot resolve a library, which answers **127** — a number that
# reads as *not found* for a binary CMake has just staged and knows the path of. The one
# sentence that explains it, `error while loading shared libraries: libyaml-cpp.so.0.8`,
# was on the child's stderr and was captured by nobody.
#
# ## Why an end-to-end configure and not a unit test of the helper
#
# `_fc_first_line` is a pure function and its parse is worth nothing on its own: what
# failed here was the ACQUISITION — two `execute_process` calls that threw the stream
# away. A test over the helper would have passed on the broken tree. So this drives the
# module's real path, through the same file:// mirror
# `check-compile-cache-daemon-staging.cmake` uses, with a staged `pace-kv` that fails
# the way the loader fails.
#
# ## Both directions
#
# A guard nobody has watched ACCEPT is not known to work, so this asserts two shapes
# rather than one:
#
#   * a daemon that dies with a stderr line -> the line is in the configure output,
#     beside the exit status;
#   * a daemon that dies SILENTLY -> the message degrades to the status alone and grows
#     no empty suffix, which is what says the capture is read rather than pasted.
#
# Neither is a shape a passing tree reaches by accident: the fake in the staging test
# exits 3 with nothing on either stream, and that test was green throughout the defect.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<repo> -DFASTCACHED_SCRATCH_DIR=<scratch>
#         -DFASTCACHED_CXX_COMPILER=<c++> [-DFASTCACHED_MAKE_PROGRAM=<make>]
#         [-DFASTCACHED_GENERATOR=<gen>]
#         -P scripts/check-compile-cache-daemon-diagnostic.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 = both shapes reported as specified, or skipped. 1 = they did not.

# Drives `check-error-popups.cmake` against staged build trees, in both directions (#1389).
#
# Each tree holds the files the check reads, in the shapes CMake generates: a manifest, a
# `CTestTestfile.cmake` (one nested, as a real build nests them) with bracket-named
# registrations, a `catch_discover_tests` include file and the `_tests.cmake` it names, and
# the `build.ninja` link edges. A refusal asserts WHICH refusal, by a phrase only that
# refusal carries: every refusal prints `CMake Error`, so asserting that alone would pass
# with the arms exchanged.

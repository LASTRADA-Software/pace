# Every fixture that STARTS `pace-node` says which of its default fleet
# features it turns off, and where it keeps its state.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# A node with no flags is a fleet member: it runs consensus on 6680, beacons discovery on
# 6681, and keeps its identity in the platform's state directory. That is right for a
# machine and wrong for a fixture, in two ways nothing else catches:
#
#   * two fixtures on one host that leave discovery on hear each other's beacons, and a
#     worker that leaves consensus on is a cluster of itself on the shared default port --
#     a cross-talk flake that shows up in somebody else's case;
#   * a node that names no `--cluster-dir` mints its identity into the REAL per-user state
#     directory of whoever runs the suite, and every such node shares it.
#
# The rule is stated in `.agent/rules/consensus-and-cluster.md` ("A fixture written about a
# node running no consensus NAMES `--listen-raft=`"), and a rule stated in the files that
# obey it reaches no file that does not -- so this is the scan.
#
# ## What it looks for, stated as a pattern
#
# A START is the node's variable in COMMAND position in a tracked `scripts/*.sh` or
# `scripts/*.ps1`: `"$node"`, `$NODE`, `${node}` at the start of a command (a line, `$(`,
# `;`, `&&`, `||`, `-- `, after `run_bounded <bound>` or after `NAME=value` prefixes), and
# `$Node` after `&`, `Start-Background` or `-FilePath` in PowerShell. Its STATEMENT is the
# enclosing multi-line `( ... )` when the variable sits inside one (an argv array), else the
# line plus its continuation lines (`\`, or a PowerShell backtick) and any parentheses opened
# on them. Arrays the statement expands (`${name[@]}`, or a PowerShell `$name` assigned an
# `@( ... )`) contribute every assignment's text, one level deep.
#
# Each statement is one of three:
#
#   one-shot   names a verb that answers and exits (`--print-surfaces`, `--cluster-status`,
#              `--install-service`, ...): nothing bound, nothing written. Passes. The verbs
#              are READ from the node's own table -- the `FileExclusion::Verb` rows of
#              `notFromFile` in `src/apps/pace-node/NodeConfig.cpp`, the list
#              the build already holds every flag a file may not carry to -- so a verb the
#              node retires stops passing here, and one it adds passes, with no edit to this
#              script. A table this cannot read, or one naming no `--help`, is refused.
#   mints      names `--print-identity`, which writes the identity. Needs
#              `--cluster-dir`.
#   runs       everything else. Needs `--cluster-dir`, and an EMPTY `--listen-raft=` (no
#              consensus, and so no discovery) or an EMPTY `--discovery=` (consensus, but no
#              beacon on the shared port). A node running a WORKER takes the second: with its
#              consensus closed it would have no scheduler to register with, and the node
#              refuses to start (`WorkerWithConsensusClosedRefusal`) -- which this scan does
#              not judge, because the node itself does, by name, at the first start.
#
# ## What it does NOT cover, said plainly, with the direction each fails in
#
#   * A statement's text is a SUPERSET of what one run passes: every assignment of an array
#     counts, including one that empties it on another path, and a parenthesis inside a
#     string can lengthen a statement. More text finds MORE flags, so both fail OPEN -- a
#     start whose flag is only conditionally present passes. The cap (`StatementCap` lines)
#     bounds how far that reaches.
#   * A start through a variable NOT named `node`/`NODE`/`Node` is not seen, which fails
#     open too -- so the scan is paired with a census that fails CLOSED: every script
#     `src/tests/CMakeLists.txt` hands the node binary must show at least one recognised
#     start, or it is refused as "handed the node and started it some way this scan does
#     not know".
#   * The verb list is a TEXT read of one C++ array, not the compiled table. A row whose
#     kind and spelling the reader cannot find is not a verb to it, so a start naming that
#     verb is refused as a start: that fails CLOSED. The reader requires the array and a
#     `--help` row before it believes a list at all, so a moved or renamed array is a
#     refusal (exit 2) rather than an empty list.
#   * Starts from C++ are out of scope: no Catch2 case spawns the node (every CTest that runs
#     it goes through a script this scan reads).
#
# ## Helpers and exemptions are rows with reasons, and a stale row is refused
#
# `scripts/check-node-fixture-starts-exemptions.txt`, tab-separated:
#
#   helper <TAB> <path> <TAB> <function> <TAB> <reason>
#       The function's CALLS are the starts (each judged as above) and the start inside its
#       body -- whose flags are its callers' `"$@"` -- is not. A row naming a function that
#       has no call, or that the file does not define, is refused as stale.
#   exempt <TAB> <path> <TAB> <text> <TAB> <reason>
#       A start statement containing <text> is excused. A row matching no statement is refused.
#   census <TAB> <path> <TAB> <how it starts the node> <TAB> <reason>
#       A script handed the node whose start this scan cannot recognise, and why that start
#       needs neither flag. Refused as stale once the scan recognises a start there, or once no
#       test hands it the node.
#
# Usage:  check-node-fixture-starts.sh [--self-test | --read-rows < rows]
# Exit:   0 clean, 1 a finding, 2 could not judge (nothing to scan, git unreadable, a table
#         that will not parse).

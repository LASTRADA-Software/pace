# Assert that cmake/portable/CompileCache.cmake says so when it selects a
# launcher that can silently produce a wrong build — and that it stays quiet
# when it selects one that cannot.
#
# That is issue #153. Under MSVC and clang-cl, sccache replays a cache hit's
# /showIncludes stream with the absolute paths spelled by the build that STORED
# it, while the text it hashes to find that hit carries no paths at all -- so a
# second checkout shares entries and then records dependencies pointing into the
# first. Measured on this repository: two worktrees at one commit, 137
# cross-worktree hits, 1097 recorded dependency edges pointing at the other
# checkout and none at its own, and `ninja: no work to do` after a real edit. The
# build stays green and the objects are stale.
#
# GCC and Clang are NOT exposed -- their preprocessed output carries the paths, so
# two checkouts do not share entries at all (measured: 0 hits, 2 misses) -- and
# the module carries the caveat on exactly that condition. Which half this run
# asserts therefore comes in as FASTCACHED_MSVC_LIKE, resolved by the caller that
# already knows the compiler rather than re-derived here.
#
# The module cannot fix that — it is sccache's replay, and pace-cc exists
# because it does not have it — so what it owes a developer is a word about it.
# This checks that the word is there.
#
# **Both halves, and the second is the point.** A warning that fired for every
# launcher would be a warning nobody reads, so the rows below assert the silence
# as well as the noise: ccache selected says nothing, and neither does caching
# switched off while sccache sits right there.
#
# Since #815 the rows also pin the GATE, in both directions, because the caveat and
# the gate are one mechanism read from two ends: sccache is opt-in
# (`-DALLOW_SCCACHE_FALLBACK=ON`), so a row that asserts the caveat must now opt in
# to reach it -- and a row that does not opt in must see sccache passed over, said
# out loud, and no caveat, since a caveat about a launcher this build did not pick
# is noise. Which makes the opt-in row the one that keeps #170's warning alive: the
# alternative remedy for #815 was to have CI set `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER`
# externally, which this module honours by returning EARLY -- taking the caveat out
# of the log with it, silently, on the platform where the hazard exists.
#
# Written as a `cmake -P` script for the reasons check-repository-hygiene.cmake
# gives at length: the rule is identical everywhere, so a .sh and a .ps1 would be
# two implementations of one rule, each free to rot without the other noticing.
#
# Unlike check-compile-cache-autoinstall.cmake this needs **no sandbox**: it
# names each launcher outright through the `find_program` cache variables the
# module already declares, rather than having to make them unfindable. So it runs
# on every host, Windows included -- which its three siblings do not, and which is
# why it opens with a canary: a Windows shell that is not a Developer shell has a
# cl.exe that exists and cannot compile.

# One row per selection outcome, pipe-delimited:
#
#   <name>|<expected output>|<forbidden output>|<stand-in launcher>|<severity>|<extra -D args>|<wired>
#
# <wired> is what the GENERATED BUILDSYSTEM must carry as the compiler launcher:
# `sccache`, `ccache`, or `none`. It is the column #187 is about. Every other field
# here asserts what the module PRINTED, and a module that printed
# `-- [cache] Enabling sccache ...` with the full caveat at the right severity while
# wiring no launcher at all would satisfy all of them -- the same defect class the
# rest of this file exists to close, one layer down. The configure line is the
# module\'s claim about itself; the launcher in the generated buildsystem is the
# artefact a compile actually runs.
#
# <severity> is `warning` when the row must produce a CMake Warning carrying the
# caveat, and empty when it must produce no warning at all. Both halves are
# checked: asserting the text alone would let the caveat be downgraded to a
# `message(STATUS)` -- the one thing its own comment argues against, since the
# symptom arrives hours later and a status line does not survive a scroll -- and
# asserting the severity alone would pass on any warning at all. <expected> is
# therefore free to name which launcher won, which every row does.
#
# <stand-in launcher> is one of sccache, ccache, sccache-and-ccache or none, and
# names which of the module's launcher variables are pointed at a real program; the
# others are forced empty so the outcome does not depend on what the host happens
# to have installed. pace-cc is always forced empty — its own row is
# conditional on a daemon answering, which is a different property with its own
# test.
#
# `sccache-and-ccache` is the reporting host of #815 exactly: both installed, and
# the question is which one a build gets when nobody said. "Nothing is selected"
# and "the next launcher is selected" are two different proofs that sccache was not
# taken automatically, and only the second one is the situation people are in.
#
# The stand-in is never run: selection records a path and wires it as a compiler
# launcher, and nothing here builds. Passing it out of band rather than in the
# row is deliberate — the rows are split on spaces, and a program path on Windows
# contains them.
#
# No row may contain a ';' — these are CMake lists, and a semicolon inside a row
# would split it in two. An empty expected or forbidden field means "do not check
# that".

# The sccache row is the one that varies, because the hazard is the COMPILER's and
# not sccache's alone: MSVC and clang-cl are exposed, GCC and Clang are not, and
# the module carries the caveat on exactly that condition. So this asserts
# whichever half applies to the compiler this build was configured with -- the
# noise on Windows, the silence elsewhere -- and CI covering both covers both.

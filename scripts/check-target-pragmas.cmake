# No source under `src/` enables an instruction set with a target pragma (#1442).
#
# `#pragma GCC target(...)` and `#pragma clang attribute push (__attribute__((target(...))), ...)` enable
# an instruction set for every function after them in the unit, inline copies included -- the hazard
# `scripts/check-instruction-set-flags.cmake` refuses as a flag, with no flag for a compile database to
# show. It is a fact about the TREE rather than about a build, so it is asked once, here, and not in every
# configuration that check reads.
#
# Per-function attributes (`__attribute__((target(...)))`, `[[gnu::target]]`) are the legitimate spelling
# and are not refused; a pragma mentioned inside a comment is not a use.
#
# ## The prefilter, and why it is not the word `pragma`
#
# `pace_scan_code_lines` is quadratic in a file's length, and every header here carries
# `#pragma once`, so a file is walked only when ONE line holds every literal word the pattern needs, in
# order. That cannot miss a use: comment stripping only removes text (or puts a space where a `/*...*/`
# was), so a line that is a use after stripping still holds those words before it. The run reports how
# many files got past the prefilter.
#
# Not covered: a pragma assembled by a macro or split across a line continuation, and one inside a string
# literal -- the reader is a line reader.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DPACE_SOURCE_DIR=<tree> -P scripts/check-target-pragmas.cmake
#
# The verdict is `CMake Error` in the output, never the exit code.

# Through `pace_tracked_files`, this tree's one answer to HOW a check finds its files,

# its sources from -- the traversal and a read of every file cost this check seconds against
# a third of a second natively. CONTAINING asks git once which files hold `target`: every line
# the pattern can match contains it, and `pragma` would not do -- every header says `#pragma
# once`. Only those are read, and the prefilter below still runs on them, so `walked` counts

# `cli-text-cell` must be SEEN to refuse a bypass, and seen to ACCEPT the reads.
#
# Both arms, and the accepting arm is not the decorative one. #1356's own acceptance
# clause says so in as many words -- *a guard nobody has watched accept is not known
# to work either* -- and this check has two ways to fail toward refusal that a red-only
# fixture cannot tell apart from working: `kind == CellKind::Text` differs from an
# assignment by one character, and `case CellKind::Text:` is how every renderer in the
# binary consumes the model. A check that refused either would be deleted rather than
# obeyed, which is the failure mode, not a cosmetic one.
#
# It also caught a real defect in the check on its first run, before this fixture
# existed: the factory signature was `Cell TextCell(` with no leading newline, which
# matched the header's `[[nodiscard]] Cell TextCell(...);` declaration as well and made
# the check refuse a healthy tree for carrying two factories. That is the fail-closed
# direction, so it presented as a red rather than as a silent pass -- which is why the
# "found 2" case below is kept: it is the behaviour that found the bug.
#
# ## The mode is part of the output, and asserted on both sides
#
# This fixture stages synthetic trees, and a synthetic tree is not a git repository. So
# every case would exercise the DIRECTORY WALK while CI exercises GIT -- which is
# exactly how `check-catch-skip-return-code` came to have six green self-test cases and
# a red CI run with no contradiction between them: the mode under test was not the mode
# in use. So the check names its mode, cases assert it, and the git path is staged for
# real with `git init` plus `git add` -- an index is all `git ls-files` needs, so no
# commit and no identity are required.
#
# ## Line numbers are asserted, not just filenames
#
# `;`, `\`, `[` and `]` are all CMake list structure and C++ is full of all four. Get
# the reading wrong and lines merge: the following line is hidden and every line number
# below it drifts. One case plants all four ABOVE a violation and asserts the exact
# `file:line`, because an assertion on the FILENAME alone passes under that bug.
#
# The mutations are applied to a SYNTHESISED tree, never to the tree under test, so
# there is no revert step and nothing can be left behind. Each case asserts its
# mutation actually LANDED before any verdict is drawn from it, and the BASELINE is
# load-bearing: every refusal below is evidence only if the unmutated tree passes.
#
# Runs as `cmake -P`. See `check-script-check-signals.cmake` for why such a check
# reports failure through its OUTPUT rather than an exit code.
#
# A `directory walk` expectation below names the mode CLASS and not which of its two reasons
# ran. Since #1485 a walk says whether there was no index at all or whether the index named no
# matching file, and which one a staged tree gets depends on where the scratch directory sits --
# a tree with no `.git` of its own is still inside a work tree whenever `CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`
# is. The git-against-walk distinction these cases exist for is unaffected; the two reasons are
# pinned in `check-tracked-files-selftest.cmake`, which controls the git probe instead of
# inheriting it.
#
# Usage:
#   cmake -DFASTCACHED_SOURCE_DIR=<dir> -DFASTCACHED_SCRATCH_DIR=<dir> \
#         -P scripts/check-cli-text-cell-selftest.cmake
#
# Exit codes: 0 always. The verdict is the presence of `CMake Error` in the output.
